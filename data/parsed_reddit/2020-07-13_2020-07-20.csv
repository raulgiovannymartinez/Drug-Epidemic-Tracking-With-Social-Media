I have previous experiences with adderall and dexedrine (both with massive success, tho dexedrine was preferrable over adderall), and none of those caused any of these side effects except for the comedown,  which i usually got away easily with my prescribed night time xanax or clonazepam (it was the perfect cycle that got me thru immensely tough times. God i miss my dexedrine...).

I thought since methylphenidate only has the dopamine/nor reuptake inhibitor action and not the additional dopamine releasing action that amphetamines have, shouldn‚Äôt it be a much milder drug? And 20mg of ritalin is not a high dose for someone like me who used addys (avg: 30-50mg) and dex(avg: 10-20mg) for a few months now, so if anything i was expecting even fewer side effects than the ones i knew from amph.

Ever since i moved back to my home country where amphetamines are illegal to prescribe, MPH is my only option for my narcolespy, and currently i take .5mg kpin approx. 1-2 hours after my ritalin dose to try to reduce the jitteriness. I know that co-admin of these two drugs at the same time is not recommended, it does work as a bandage solution for now.

It contains butalbital (a barbiturate), acetaminophen, and caffeine. Similarly, I run out of 30 tabs Fioricet in 10 days or so.... I even abuse Ambien (without much reason other than I don‚Äôt find it as effective as before and I have insomnia even on nights that I take no stimulants.

If I could actually moderate my dose and and use it sparingly I think I‚Äôd actually be happy with the effectiveness of these meds which I do feel are necessary for me but to an appropriate and less-than-daily extent.

Abusing these meds isn‚Äôt even something I find fun, sadly, and it started becoming out of control when I went through an intense, demanding, and time consuming period of my life. When I in a period of abuse I tend to really only experience negative effects, yet I do it anyway. I guess I just hope for the positive however unlikely it may be.

With my birthday coming up soon, I‚Äôm all too acutely aware of my poor drug habits and it makes me sad and ashamed. I keep it hidden from everyone I know. I‚Äôm 30 now and it was only just a few years back, at 26 years old where I abstained from all drugs and hadn‚Äôt even taken any besides an NSAID rarely or something innocuous (even didn‚Äôt drink or tended not to have caffeine even) and felt better about myself compared to now. I cry about my current self especially since I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd function in almost any job with this going on.

This has effected my life to a point I can only lament the past me. Does anyone have guidance in taking my meds appropriately and NOT excessively every single day (is, as prescribed dosage)?

I've been goin thru cycles w/ this shit of either fully abusing, regularly using (for school) and cold turkey for about 2+ years now, and after I took a monthlong break recently I've slipped back into a stupppid binge for almost two weeks. Ive been up to &gt;120mg's throughout a whole day (not at once) at points. Anywho... as of now I'm noticing all these symptoms which are increasing as time passes:

Horrrrrrrible, I mean fuckin god awful brutal comedowns. I never really used to get them too bad but I've been feeling like I've been hit by a truck when effects are gone and have been snorting more in the afternoon to try to combat it (kinda works)

Tingling sensations: In my head, chest arms, but most notably my hands and feet get so bad they start feeling cold, and go fully numb at times

Heavy heartbeats: Random times thoughout the day I can feel my heart pounding like a motherfucker

Chest Pains, Shaking, Nerves, anxiety and a lot of that ""butterflies in stomach"" feeling, oh and nausea (but not too too bad)

My mouth is now had any of the moisture in it just obliterated... no matter what I do

oh and lastly, a little short of breath

I'm aware this isn't normal, especially for a 20 year old guy, and I'm gonna try to break from this cycle I'm in, However what I'm wondering is if I should be at all concerned about any of this, or if these are just some short term symptoms that'll fade when I stop.

So I‚Äôm 20 and had my first trip at 16. Between 16 and 20 I have had around 40 acid trip, a handful of shroom trips, one sub breakthrough dmt trip, and I was addicted to dxm for a solid 6 months and I‚Äôve taken pure mdma a few times. 

I felt like I was very comfortable with lsd, I used to drop every single weekend because I enjoyed it so fucking much. I never thought it would change on me because all of my trips had been nothing but perfect. 

I hadn‚Äôt tripped in about 6 months so i started asking around one day seeing if my friends knew where to find any acid. The first dude I hit up messaged me back saying his friend had two tabs we could get. We get the tabs and I wait till about 8pm to drop knowing I‚Äôd have nothing to worry about and could relax and trip all night. 

I drop one tab and didn‚Äôt taste anything, I let it sit under my tongue for about half an hour then swallowed it. I swear it was placebo but within 15 mins I was tearing up listening to music because it sounded so damn beautiful. I was smoking a ton of weed which I do on all my trips, and didn‚Äôt expect much besides an increase in my trip. 

I was laying on my bed peaking acid and listening to music when I started having some introspection. I started asking myself ‚Äúwhy am I never happy?‚Äù Ive been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for a few years now but never really reached out for help. I‚Äôve tried to confront it on trips before but I could never focus on the problem and tell myself why I‚Äôm always so depressed. 

The more I thought about it the more I was realizing I‚Äôm not happy physically, mentally, whatever. All I do is smoke weed and that‚Äôs really all I want to do, I realized how meaningless this really was. I started thinking ‚Äúwhy not end this now and save a ton of money in the long run‚Äù I was thinking very irrationally because the lsd was amplifying any negative thoughts I was having. I felt like the biggest piece of shit, I hated who I‚Äôve became.

I managed to lay in bed and focus on the music and watch my popcorn ceiling. While I was peaking and having suicidal thoughts the best way I can describe what I was feeling was it felt like my soul was being sucked out through my throat or something. Hard to explain but my vision was also somewhere between 1st and 3rd person view even tho I had my eyes open. I was tripping way harder then I expected from just one tab off a street dealer to say the least. 

I realized I really need to take my mental state seriously, even tho I had been depressed the day I wanted to drop shouldn‚Äôt have been my ‚Äúgreen light‚Äù that I‚Äôd have an amazing trip. I‚Äôm going to find a psychiatrist after the quarantine is over because I really have no excuse not to reach out for help before it‚Äôs too late.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,695375,public,confidence,self,Had my first bad trip when I thought I was comfortable with lsd,0,[],0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hudkoj/had_my_first_bad_trip_when_i_thought_i_was/,no_ads,0.0,1595242328.0,#fcfcfc,dark,,,,,,,,,,,40e0de10-c007-11ea-b2d4-0e28f5c16a0d,,,,,

I know this subreddit probably discusses drugs more fun than Acetaminophen usually, but I have a question about tylenol. I‚Äôve seen everywhere online that taking &gt; 4g of tylenol in a day can lead to serious liver damage, but I was wondering about the effects of frequent day-to-day usage much under that range.

I‚Äôve suffered from migraines and tension headaches since I was little and it‚Äôs still something I‚Äôm working on, but when headaches get out of control I‚Äôll typically take 500mg or 1g to knock it out. Problem is, some weeks I‚Äôll have 4 migraines, others maybe 1 or even 0. I worry about the weeks where I‚Äôm taking 2 500 mg tylenol 4 out of 7 days of the week, am I at risk of developing the same liver/kidney damage over time?

We are trying to come up with a list of things to help the body load. Aspirin and magnesium are the only things we know for sure have worked but they sometimes cause side effects. So, we have some more ideas.

I am wondering if anyone has experience with any of these things and how they combined with psychedelics. A major plus would be helping anxiety without reducing the main cognitive effects.

So here are the things we came up with that could help the body load:

* Phsyical exercise
* Hot bath
* Bacopa monnieri
* Gabapentin
* Aspirin
* L-arginine
* L-citrulline
* Magnesium
* Guafenesin (can act as muscle relaxer, may make nausea worse though)
* Vitamin C (can act as vasodilator)
* L-theanine
* Taurine
* Ginger (mainly for nausea)
* Cannabis (tread with extreme caution, may synergize and cause anxiety)

So, does anyone have experience with any of these and psychedelics, or know of anything else that can help reduce body load?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,695355,public,confidence,self,Psychedelic body load reduction,0,[],0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hucwz0/psychedelic_body_load_reduction/,no_ads,0.0,1595239570.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I stumbled to the toilet and my legs collapsed leaving me on my knees bent over the toilet. This is the point my high went apeshit south. I began to lose sense of reality and my vision completely.

I started to have lsd visuals (I had just experienced lsd for the first time a months prior) then I went into the darkness. I thought I was on heroin at this point. I was seeing random images of animals places words along with random sounds. I travelled to hell and then I saw god.

I saw him from behind I think he was unaware of my presence but I made a pact to myself that i would pray 3 times daily if he brought me back to life. 

I was told by an angel that I must first experience 5 more drugs. I then began to shake uncontrollably which I believe was molly then I moved onto feeling like I was on Xanax along with other drugs a voice in my head was telling me I am now experiencing.

That one night was absolutely intense, crazy 
experience with food, crazy experience looking at pictures of my loved ones, and crazy orgasm master-bating ( literally saw fireworks and it lasted absolutely forever)  .  The next day, I skipped a day of my conference and went shopping for my family, I took everything slow, enjoyed and noticed every moment.  That started what is now my dilemma .  Months have passed and now I am a weekly user. I have had mostly good experiences except 2, which ever really bad.  Otherwise, I really enjoy my weekly take.  I mostly associate it with sex and I only have t before sex on weekends.   It makes for the most euphoric sex, my body is just in tingles, I can have sex over and over again and the orgasms are just amazing.  In the days after, I feel like I am more impatient especially with work.  I don‚Äôt enjoy what I do the last 2 years and the feel of not enjoying it and then working from home, I feel like have affected my performance and one week I made a mistake that may cost me my job.  Nothing big or unrecoverable, but it affects my rep.  So that week I stopped, but I miss the feeling of it with sex a lot , I really looked forward to it.

What happened was I chilled at one of my best friends place and did what we always did.
So I took two shots of this vodka that he'd put some buds of weed into it and took a hit of the bong.

Little note: I'm 25, been smoking a shit lot of weed for about 6-7 years, always joints mixed with a little bit of tobacco, rarely bong maybe once or twice in a month.

After the bong hit everything was cool, 10 minutes later I asked him if I could take another hit of the bong with this dope indoor weed that he'd grown. Took a huge bong rip, didn't cough and I was super high. Another 10 minutes passed by and suddenly I felt this weird sensation in my body occurring. I don't know how to explain it but it was some sort of anxiety that has slowly started to build up and I gave in to that. My heart started to pound super super fast and I thought I'd get a heart attack or something so I laid down in his bed and then I was super cold and my lower body suddenly started to shake while my heart was still pounding. At that moment I thought I'd die seriously. The funny thing is this never ever happened before in my entire life and I've been smoking a looooot of weed.
My buddy tried to calm me down but it didn't help so he drove me home and told me to take some cbd oil which I did and it helped. Talked to some of my friends and some also experienced the same shit and told me it's a weed induced panic attack. 

Ever since that happened I took around 4 months off and slowly tried smoking again by always taking 2-3 puffs but the thing is I can no longer enjoy smoking because my brain somehow associates smoking weed with this incident that happened some months ago and I always get anxiety when I smoke even if I only take 1-2 puffs where my heart starts beating faster and I feel anxious and kinda in this tunnel vision feeling of anxiety. 

I really want to enjoy smoking weed again but without having to think about getting a panic attack and feeling anxious about something that might happen. It's like it's in my subconsciousnes. 

Has anyone experienced the same thing? How can I shut down my brain and not think about anything when smoking.

After the bad trip, my flashbacks, which I have often from smoking weed, turned very unpleasant, even tho I enjoy the LSD body high, it was very very unpleasant and led me into derealization and depersonalization.

By taking diazepam 5mg and smoking weed again, I realized I can slowly taper the diazepam, while addressing my trauma to another state.

Suddenly I simply blocked my memory from the bad trip, I automatically block it whenever I even try to remember. This resulted in me remembering my older previous trips with LSD and even NBOME or ALD-52, which ones that had a very good body high and mindstate. Now, my flashbacks are even pleasant and they are making me have a good mental feeling again. 

Drugs are fucking insanely powerful sometimes.

Also I got hooked on diazepam and other benzos and am tapering off them. I smoke weed to face my fear of tripping again and enjoy the everyday life. Once I stop benzos I will stay away from weed and will wait until recovery to start using any psychoactive stuff again.

Man I don't know how I feel about this.  My head's a mess and this is all just uncomfortable.

I recently have only been buying from two guys.  Let's call em H and P.  I was consistently buying coke from H.  H decided to get sober recently.  I respected the hell out of that. He wanted to better himself.  He wanted to stop ruining his health with the drugs.  No moderation, just wanted to chill out with it.  I didn't hit H up for anything because I didn't wanna derail him, didn't want to trigger him.  I found out he was sober but still dealing.  I messaged him, asked him if he was comfortable with selling to me one more time or if it would derail him.  I double, triple checked he would be solid with it, and he said he was.  So I paid him and he picked up.  I was gonna pick up from him the next day.  Except the next day came, and he didn't wake up.  Drug-related death.  Complications from an overdose.  The fucking NICEST kid and dealer I'd ever met. He was more than a dealer, that was just a side hustle.  He was a good guy, had good conversations with him.  I wish I knew him outside this scene because we could've been good friends.  But now he's gone.  He OD'd after being sober. What if the drugs he picked up for me fucking killed him?  He was selling to others too but what if it was my stash that killed him?

Then there's P.  Only picked up from him once or twice when H wasn't stocked or when I didn't wanna bother him.  Before I knew H had been in the hospital, I hit P up for some coke since I wasn't getting a response from H (again, didn't know he was in the hospital).  I send the money, dealer was already on his way for his own party favors so it ended up working out perfect.  I was gonna pick up later that day.  We were talking throughout the day, I knock out for a little bit, then hit him up. No response.  I knew both H and P weren't the type to try and beat me, knew he wasn't scamming me.  By this point, I already knew H was in the hospital and wasn't doing well.  Then I had found out H passed.  Hours pass, hours pass, still nothing.  Then I see tweets from P's friends.

He passed away.

I don't know from what.  He wasn't the healthiest mentally.  But he had accidentally OD'd a couple of times before so that wasn't out the question.  But holy shit.  My two dealers, gone just like that. I don't give a fuck that I lost a couple hundred dollars. I couldn't care less if I never touch the stuff again.  These were two fucking young men that had whole lives ahead of them, had family and friends that genuinely gave a damn about them.  And they're just gone?  What the hell man...

I can't help but feel guilty for their deaths, mainly H's.  I know it's not about me, I know it might be irrational.  But H was getting clean and picked up for me and then he OD's.  P was already reupping but still, what if my bullshit ousted them over the edge?

I'm sorry for the ramble.  I just don't know where my head's at.  I know I needed to get clean, this ain't my first rodeo.  That could've been me and honestly I wish it was because these guys deserved better. My heart hurts.

From what I can tell about looking at past test results they search for benzodiazepines and I believe it has a cut off of 200 ng. On the lab test. I have calculated it from the time I took it to the time I've got to be at the appointment it should be somewhere around 224 hours after I took the dose.,True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,695292,public,confidence,self,alprazolam metabolite detection time in a lab urine test,0,[],0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hu6uyy/alprazolam_metabolite_detection_time_in_a_lab/,no_ads,0.0,1595217152.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been trying to quit both over the last year or so but i've relapsed a couple of times. I used these drugs as a way of self medicating for my mental health problems which have made my life miserable. 

I recently spent 3 weeks in a psych ward to work on my mental issues and have a break from drugs. I was sober from meth for about a month and a half. The other night I met up with a friend to buy a few Xanax bars. I ended up getting really drunk, using meth again and I even bought some extra meth.

I was planning to go to sleep the night after I hung out with this friend but I can't get myself to sleep. I've tried taking benzos and my usual sleep medication Mirtazapine but they're not making me drowsy, just relaxing me. Usually they help me in this kind of situation but they're not this time.

The last couple of days i've tried taking meds to fall asleep but they're not doing anything. Each night after trying to sleep for a couple of hours i've been finishing off that extra amount that I bought to get me through the night. I realise this obviously isn't helping my situation but the addict part of my mind wanted me to smoke the rest.

When I used in the past I would usually stay up for about 3 days and then get some  sleep to avoid meth psychosis. Then keep using when I woke up. The longest I've stayed up on meth is 6 days but I remember the psychosis becoming insane at that point and I don't want to experience that again. I'm already hearing voices and seeing weird shit.

I might try antipsychotics to help fall asleep if I can get some today and if they're not working I'll try benzos again or something similar. I was wondering if you had any other advice for ways to fall asleep or medications I can try?

I had my last hit of meth about 3-4 hours ago and I'm still high but I should be sobering up soon enough. I plan on quitting meth as soon as I can but it's crazy the addictive hold it has on me.

I know i fucked up my brains development by smoking weed so early, by drinking so early, by getting a stimulant habit so early (since I was 4 years old for ADD/HD; like 18 years old for illegal drugs (stopped doing coke 4 years ago)), by taking psychs so early.

I've been trying to slowly piece my life back together and make positive strides to be better. I've been going to therapy again for the first time in years and I'm happy with getting back into that. I don't drink as much as I used to, maybe 2 or 3 beers a night a few nights a week. Sometimes I smoke CBD in the evenings to chill out but that hasn't developed into an unhealthy habit like weed was. I'm trying to start an exercise routine, I've been making my own meals and eating healthier, i started a small business with the family farm, and I moved into my own place and am paying bills and becoming an adult.

Even though I'm doing what many people would consider positive things and striving forward I still feel very lost. I feel like I've lost my sense of identity since I have stopped smoking weed. I've lost a lot of friends because that was our only thing in common and that's very disheartening. I can't seem to focus on getting things done and I have a problem with being able to see the big picture and end goals and achieving them. I can break problems down into bits and pieces that are manageable but I still end up feeling overwhelmed, lost, and discouraged. I no longer feel depressed like I used to belz, sometimes I'm anxious but that's because I get overwhelmed by the tasks at hand. I'm happy to say I'm not on medication and that I don't want to be on medication because I feel like these are issues that can be addressed by an alternative means.

What it comes down to is I need help, advice, literature, videos, WHATEVER you think may be of assistance to me and my predicament. I want to start working towards being a complete human being and being able to function and complete tasks without feeling overwhelmed or beating myself up for not accomplishing tasks.

I figure either iphone and icalendar will be obsolete by then or Apple will actually be running the world. 

Anyway, somehow I ended up looking through a bunch of old pictures  just feeling super reminiscent of old times. Like the kind that hits you and for a split second you can remember with extreme clarity and almost feel the in the moment joy and excitement of those memories. Man, I miss that shit.

I'm only 25 but sometimes I feel the days of unadulterated  joy are behind me. We all know growing up is boring but some days it just hits harder than others. As it turns out, having your shit together isn't all it was cracked up to be. 

To be honest I wanna live in a shit aparment with the boys again and get drunk every night, I wanna go over to a friend of a friends and get too stoned to function. I want to spend my days off going on adventures with the homies instead of recuperating from work. I want to be constantly looking forward to that next thing that is already planned or even stumbling on to those spontaneous great nights.

The feeling was not really the same as when I get anxiety or panic attack (used to have daily panic attacks years ago that lasted months, now I only have anxiety), it felt different and only has happened when I smoke Weed or Spice/K2, no other drug gave me this feeling.

I just hope he kills the part of me I wish to leave behind.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then here are some more fleshed out poems I wrote trying to integrate the experience:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some days I just feel like an animal, although not in a ferocious sense, but more like a lizard on a rock. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sun-soaked with blown out highlights, slowly licking his eyeballs waiting patiently for that fly to unwittingly pause before him, meeting its demise as if it was prophesied.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the fly arrives. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other times the darkness comes before it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On those days I scuttle back to my tiny lizard hole, decorated with things I&amp;#39;ve gathered along my journey and I look at everything around me with a profound existential confusion that my tiny lizard brain can&amp;#39;t process. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s okay. Tomorrow the fly will come. Tomorrow is the day it all comes together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up and saw I only slept 6 hours and had to accept it. The light leaking through my blinds was orange like a sunset and I thought it must be a beautiful morning out there in that infinite universe. My philodendron cutting has rooted and started growing and I can almost hear it reaching for that orange light. Me too, little buddy. Me too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alone in my room the darkness becomes a table to which I invite all the things I&amp;#39;ve feared in my life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond the ceiling lie all the spaces in between the stars; an infinity I&amp;#39;m too tired to pretend I comprehend.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I question my reasons to be anything other than an animal and wonder what others think of in these quiet sleepless hours.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I breathe three times yet turn up empty handed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t enumerate the amount of times I&amp;#39;ve tried to meditate quickly, while the creeping undergrowth of guilt sent runners to those quiet barren places. It took time, but each one I baptized with the waters of unconditional acceptance. Now in the garden of my past sorrows I think I&amp;#39;ve found my Eden.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What a strangely calm night&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With a curious indigo sky&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ride home accompanied by my squeaking chain&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing today I watered the garden&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Felt like a king&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got lost in some questions&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Learned a couple things&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Practiced doing nothing &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagined I was someone else&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Found reasons to be grateful for who I am. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired but restless&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need sleep but have grown accostomed to its absence&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'ketamine', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2snr6', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/ketamine', 'subreddit_subscribers': 37734, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': ""Notes from a ketamine bender - 'Sensation Sans Emotion'"", 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 5, 'upvote_ratio': 0.86, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/ketamine/comments/hu3cb7/notes_from_a_ketamine_bender_sensation_sans/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': None, 'wls': None}]",,,

So I have been experimenting with standing up too fast. It seems to provide a very fast dissociation/ego death similar to a DMT come up, especially during the summer.

He took it and 60 minutes later he was repeatedly puking. Later he went to the ER and got IV morphine. Since he will probably never touch that script after this first experience I thought I might wanna help him get rid of it.

Now I have a couple questions about Tramadol which will help me decide if I even wanna touch that stuff.
1. How common is it to get nausea to the point of puking from 50mg?
2. Does Tramadol have recreational value?
3. What is a good recreational dose for someone without an opiate tolerance?
4. Does taking a higher dose increase the likelihood of puking? (Gonna bet probably yes)

I started drinking as a kid, rarely but still did it, like a couple of time a years in special occasions, loved wine and liquor. When I became a teen I sought beer, drank once a month or every couple of months. At 18 I start working and I can spend my own money on booze and I fill the diagnosis for alcoholism. 18-19 I start doing drugs (weed, prescription pills, psychedelics, cocaine, everything, never IV anything to this day). At 20 I'm a full blown addict and I'm aware of it. 23 things got too wild, too many ER visits and a psych ward stay and a psychotic break. I also study a lot, got a degree, got a career, got a profession. Got a whole career sustaining my habit and I can still save some money, I'm not wealthy though. 

I'm 26, been going hard since Friday MORNING and it's Sunday morning. Supposed did powdered 2CB (just a fuckton of amphetamines crashed together with a pink colorant), tea weed which I didn't even notice and a fuckton of weed. I relapsed back to 24/7 use for more than two months (alcohol, prescription opiate, benzo, weed cocktail) and it hasn't been fun. Lost weight, food makes me sick and I'm never hungry. I'm mentally tired (from yesterday 2C but I rarely do 2C or similar substances). I can't use anything today because of virus lockdown and pharmacies are closed and I forgot to buy some shit and I can't even go out. 

So this is life right now, it will stay this way until I die. I will have a supply of income, most of my income goes to vices, I will always be using what I use (weed and downers), it's not like I can get something stronger. So work, money, drugs, sleep, wake up, work, repeat. Maybe it's time to take a break, try to quit maybe? I've been through a lot in less than a decade, I don't understand how people can do it for decades. ER, overdoses, hospitals, fights, seizures, rehab, near death experiences, ambulances, police. None of this shit remotely scares me at all at this point and I had a ""good upbringing"" and I'm a ""law abiding productive professional of society"".

I recently procured 1 g of opium resin for pain relief purposes. I was advised that I could use it to make tea = good for me as a non smoker.

After looking around online I decided to make a tincture, about 0.5 grams (max, it was probably less) dissolved in 300 ml spirits and water with vinegar and some sugar to make it taste nicer. Left it about 1 week to steep so far. 

Taking on board the countless warnings to dose cautiously on your first try, I have today, very cautiously, tried about 1-2 ml of it over a 3 hour period, sipping some every hour. So far, it's mild and sedating but doing something for the pain. I would like to try more but one thing concerns me. 

Each time I sipped it, I had about 45 minutes of chest pressure afterwards which wore off. is is this normal? I've had something similar when trying hydrocodone, which isn't my favourite opiate for pain, for this reason (that, and the nausea it causes). I haven't had an effect like that from codeine or  morphine on their own, though. 

Is this a sign that there is something else in the poppy that is, say, less than desirable, or is it normal?

Even if I am in a good mood, I find that alcohol makes me feel worse. I get no euphoria and the main effect is that I feel slower (ie. drunk with none of the positives). If I have any negative emotions at all, no matter how minor, I find that they are exacerbated and I can become acutely depressed.

One explanation I have considered is that my body is less used to processing alcohol because of my lower drinking frequency; however, I remember my first few times drinking ever being the most enjoyable of my life, which is inconsistent with this explanation.

I have a relatively sensitive stomach, and have gotten sick from drinking many times, which may also have something to do with this?

My primary hypothesis is that I have may have some sort of nutritional issue that compromises my ability to effectively process alcohol, however I am interested in nutrition/supplements which may bias me towards this sort of explanation.

Going for absolute clarity as I would love help figuring out this mystery. 

My friend (who use to do many drugs frequently in the past but now only does them once every few months) did GHB for the 2nd time. The first time, my friend took about 5 ml over 2 doses about a half hour apart, mixed with water, with no effect whatsoever. This happened about a week prior to the following event and this isn't what I'm asking about. It's just here for background info in case it's relevant. 

What I'm asking about is what happened the 2nd and final time she did it. She ate a moderate sized meal about 4 hours prior to ingesting a one-time dose of about 8 ml of GHB mixed with an alcoholic beverage. She sipped the drink over the course of about 30 mins until she got to the final third, which tasted terrible as it seemed like the majority of the salty poor-tasting GHB had settled at the bottom of the drink. She then downed that final third of the drink. Almost immediately, she began to feel nauseous. She didn't eat or drink anything after that due to how terrible she felt. Within the next 30 mins, she developed tingling in her hands. About an hour after that, she was very sleepy. During the following 4 hours, she would wake up roughly every 10-15 mins and scream in obvious anxious discomfort but couldn't elaborate on what she was feeling. At times during her periods of being awake, she would vomit. Her sleep was usually not heavy. I tried to place her in a more comfortable position with a pillow on the floor but moving her even a little would wake her up and she'd start screaming again. Other times, she would be in a deep sleep. She farted and pooped a little once and didn't seem to mind when I wiped her clean. About 5 hours after ingesting the GHB, she awoke and was completely alert, though very nauseous, drowsy, and generally weak. She couldn't make it to the bathroom on her own 2 feet so I dragged her on a towel to the doorway. She moved herself inside and was on the toilet for a while. When she was ready, I again dragged her out of the bathroom and to the living room sofa which she laid on for awhile. She drank water which she stated tasted like it had GHB but which i know for a fact did not. She later moved herself to the upstairs bedroom and slept. She eventually awoke and felt well enough about 20 hours after ingesting GHB to drive nearly an hour straight and spent time with family for a few hours, though she remained nauseous and drowsy, and also had palpitations. She arrived back at her place about 24 hours after ingesting GHB with the same nausea, drowsiness, and palpitations. However, she was able to remain awake and alert on her own. She drank water at her place which she again stated tasted like it had GHB which I know for a fact did not. She cleaned out the water pitcher and refilled with water and immediately the taste of GHB in the water disappeared. Again, I want to stress that there was no GHB in any of the water she had had at either residence. However, she states she began to have similar symptoms to what she experienced the previous night when taking GHB, which included drowsiness, nausea, palpitations, and a feeling of not being completely alert and with it, in addition to the new symptom of shakiness. She was convinced that the water she drank at her place had contained GHB so she drove to the nearby hospital's emergency department where she was shaking so badly they couldn't get a good EKG on her. She says they couldn't get a good IV started which led to blood squirting out which she didn't care at all about in that moment which is unusual for her. She also felt so much mental fogginess that she couldn't remember her address. They says they tested her for GHB and it was negative, but that she was told it doesn't show up in urine until 4 hours after ingestion and it had only been 1-2 hours. She drove home still drowsy and tired with mental fogginess, and didn't go to another emergency department at the 4 hour mark to get tested at the ""right time"" because she was too tired as she hadn't slept well for 2 nights. 

What I am trying to figure out is how she had a recurrence of the same symptoms roughly 24 hours later without ingesting any more GHB? What possibly could have happened for her to experience the effect twice 24 hours apart with only one ingestion? She is adamant she tasted GHB in the water she had at both residences which she believes led to her 2nd intoxication, but I can tell you with 100% certainty that neither contained any GHB. How could she have tasted it again in the water if it was definitely not in there? Thanks in advance!

TL;DR: Friend took GHB once and had immediate effects which partially resolved but then suddenly had an increase in severity of effects nearly 24 hours later without new ingestion.

Acetaldehyde is then metabolized to the less toxic acetic acid.

Fomepizole is an inhibitor of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme that metabolizes alcohol to acetaldehyde. This would mean that blood alcohol levels would remain higher for longer, but also that acetaldehyde would be produced at a greatly reduced rate. Therefore blood acetaldehyde levels would be much lower, as the small amounts of acetaldehyde that are created can be quickly metabolized to acetic acid.

Obviously you would need to drink a lot less alcohol, but in general, this seems like it could work. I can't find anything online about it, perhaps in part because fomepizole is usually given IV, but there are studied which show that oral fomepizole is well absorbed.

This story is around 2 years ago when i have a chance to visit Saigon-Vietnam. Met a massage girl who i thought was very attractive. I came to her workplace every day for a massage (regular massage!), the weather at that time was super hot and humid probably 95F, so visit a massage place with AC in a private room is fking relaxing ( listen to music, flirt with a cute girl while she giving a massage is so nice). In case you're wondering, the place charge me 18$ for 2 hours + tip(usually the same as the room fee) for the girl ( they only earn money from tip). After getting to know her, I ask her to show me around the city and at the end of the night, she usually brings me to some fancy restaurants  (free dinner for her every day!). One time, she brought 2 of her friends and we go eat some street foods and while talking, her friends bring up about getting high and stuffs and they refer it as ""candy"". Just let you know, i never smoke or try any drugs before, so i was a little scare x\_X, but i was extremely curious so i ask them to let me try. After we finished our dinner, they texted someone and book the room for us (its a karaoke place).  So the 4 of us get there around 10Pm , and one of the staff brought us to the 3rd floor to a karaoke room. The room is extremely nice with light and club music. After we settle down, the girl handed me a half tablet( she bit the other half), I asked her what is it she said its ""candy"" and i asked her is this ecstasy and she nodded.  Quickly turn on my phone and did quick research about it, and it doesn't sound too bad. so I swallow half the tablet, everything is normal until  45 minutes later. when it kick in, i love everything about it!  I was laying on the girl lap while she smoke shisha and blow to my face ( gosh i miss it!) they all singing and dancing together. Not sure why i don't have the energy to do that, they take turn to take care of me-but mainly the girl i like ( give me fruit, water while tapping my thigh/shoulder for me to relax??)  They shout some poetries, quotes, mottos that sound so fking fun. They also try the white powder and divide in lines and sniff them, they ask me if i want to try it but i shake my head (the ecstasy is already hard core for me, so im not ready to try another drug,  and later i found out its call ketamin). Throughout the night, i enjoyed every minute of it, and we ended at 4am.

A week ago one Saturday night I was on the comedown of a 0.2g MDMA trip, I'd say I was maybe 2.5 - 3 hours after I took the points.  I begin to smoke some cones and had around 7 cones.  I was with friends and everybody went to bed so I decided to go to bed also.  We were all in the same room on different beds and then while I was falling asleep.

 I had these feelings in my head that my friends were saying stuff and talking amongst themselves, I then reopen my eyes and then look around and everyone is still asleep, I also was having visions of my phone getting a notification so I picked up my phone next to me and saw that no notifications came on my phone. I was having little wig-outs like this for the following 20 minutes and would think my friends were talking about the most random topics but none of this was actually happening?

After the first 4 hours, I started hallucinating vividly (similarly to LSD) but instead of a spiritual trip, I was seeing reality in such different ways that I‚Äôve ever seen it before.
Stars were moving at light speed, I could see both the sun and the moon at the same time (at midnight), shadows were dancing and I was so drawn to them, and the scariest one was I kept seeing faces in my peripherals. There was no colours or waves like on lsd, everything seemed so real.
The worst part was, every time I‚Äôd close my eyes I‚Äôd immediately forget where I was and who I was with. I still have vivid memories of ‚Äòdreams‚Äô last night. Over an 8 hour period of sleep, I woke my girlfriend up 15 times (she recorded it) by talking to her in absolute jibberish. She said I started to terrify her because I would just wake up and start talking in the middle of a conversation with a friend I haven‚Äôt seen in 2 years, or a phone call to my mum.

After waking up from these dreams, I would continue talking and realise what I was saying and became so so confused.

The prime example: I closed my eyes after waking myself up by talking jibberish. After 30 seconds max, I feel into a dream in which my entire friend group was giving me an intervention about drug addiction, and I would just run and jump out the window and wake up in an anxiety attack. This exact same dream and response continued over 5 times, each time spread apart by less than 2 minutes.

It‚Äôs difficult to explain as I‚Äôm not on the drug right now, but when I was in the ‚Äòdreams‚Äô I was 100% they were real and was certain that I wasn‚Äôt going to wake up if I jumped out the window. This is so distressing because I jumped to my death (in the dream) 5 times within half an hour, having to fully accept my death each time! As soon as I woke up, I would say a few more words then immediately catch myself in reality and become very embarrassed.

We did intensive research, made sure we were in the right frame of mind for it and we had a sitter to watch us. 

We took a small amount, not sure the grams but it wasn't much at all as all we could find was one half bag, and we halved that. 

I was already a everyday weed smoker, and I had done cocaine and MDMA in the past, I've always liked to experience drugs at least once.

Never had a bad experience on those drugs other then feeling nausea towards the end of the night. 

So its a Saturday morning, we are in a apartment, little bit hungover from the night before as we had drinks.

***THE TRIP***

Around 4:30pm we take the shrooms, within 20 minutes I already felt it but I was denying it because it was so intense, I had to lay on the ground in the lounge room and concentrate on the tv as I was so scared to look at anything else because everything was moving and nothing seemed ""real"". 

My friend (21F) who took the shrooms with me was tripping hard, but she seemed in control of it mostly, she would come in and out, or at the time we were calling it ""coming back"". 

but with me I felt like I couldn't come back, I went onto the balcony to get some air and have a cigarette, that made me feel better until I realized it was night time and as I was looking into the city (high rise buildings) I started thinking we were in a dome because all I could see was buildings and darkness.

So I went back inside laid on the ground and tried to concentrate on one thing again, we were listening to music and I was looking at the roof and it looked like the ocean and that made me nauseous and I had to run to the bathroom. 

I had diarrhea, now this is the most terrifying thing while being in this head space, on the toilet with a mirror directly across from me ( for some reason I couldn't look in a mirror, I didn't like feeling my own existence, even my body, every time I stood up my legs would give up, and I couldn't open doors, our sitter had to open doors for me and even pour me a drink of water and bring it to me, I had no motor skills at all)

After my bathroom experience I laid back down on the floor with a blanket, I cant really explain it other then not being able to control or feel my own body? that is what was really messing with me. 

The voices of my friends were making me uncomfortable, I needed silence so I decided to go lay in bed and try to sleep, our sitter came and laid next to me and we googled how to sober up from shrooms faster, that was really comforting for me and laying down helped a whole heap. 

Being in the dark with the window and blind opened a tiny bit was good as I couldn't really look at something and trip out. 

I probably laid there for 2 hours, thoughts running wild in my head, I cant remember them now but they were crazy, but I mainly remember thinking I'm never going to get out of this trip, I will never feel the same and this is never going to end. 

Until I just said out loud to myself ""its just drugs, it will end, hang in there"" 

I said that out loud a couple times, laid down with my eyes closed for probably another hour and then I was starting to sober up and it was THE BEST FEELING IN THE WORLD to be in control again of me.

Around 11 pm my other friend who was also on shrooms started crying as she was sobering up and said we need to go home as she needed to feel ""grounded""  (we were staying in a high rise apartment for the weekend) I agreed because at this point all I wanted was home and our sitter said alright lets pack up and leave. 

We weren't yet to check out until Monday morning. 

So we went home, I watched a movie and fell asleep, woke up feeling still a little strange but feeling way better.

***AFTER THE TRIP***

I was very sad I had this experience as I was excited to start exploring psychedelics but this has made me think hard and deep about how I abuse drugs, as in weed and how I don't need to consume it everyday and I really appreciate my sober mind more then ever, I really need to understand why I consume drugs and what am I avoiding or trying to suppress, it made me realize how unhealthy it was and ""its just a little weed"" cant be a excuse, I need to recognize the deeper issue.

I was hoping to get a breakthrough experience out of this but it has just made me shit scared of drugs lol

but I also realized I wasn't in the right head space and I was lying to myself when I said I was.

I'm 21 now. I was in 7th grade when this happened. There was a kid in my class that I knew was trouble but we would joke around in class and I didn't have many friends so we kinda got along, though I never trusted him. He pressured me into trying it for weeks until I finally gave in even though I didn't want to. 

I told my mom to pick me up from school at 5 that day because I had to ""stay late to retake a test."" He assured me we'd be back in time, and that we were gonna be just down the street. We ended up getting on a bus that took us about 10 miles away (actually near where I lived, which will play into the story later.) I recognized where we were but we walked into this small neighborhood that I'd never been to and had a lot of curvy and confusing roads. He rolled up a joint, and I puffed on it, and he said I needed to inhale. So I inhaled on the second hit, and I was ok for a minute, but it was enough to fuck me up. Then we kept walking further into the neighborhood to a spot that he knew, but I had absolutely no idea where I was. I was already seeing my life flash before my eyes every 5 seconds, and it stayed that way for the entire high. It was uphill and I felt like I could barely walk, but I made it. At this point, I asked him what time it was (I didn't have a phone or a watch) and it was already 4:30. I started to panic, knowing that I had no way of contacting anyone, let alone be back at school. I was pissed at him and told him I had to leave. I wandered the neighborhood trying to find a way out for what seemed like hours, although it was only about 30 minutes. I felt like I was gonna collapse and the dehydration alone would kill me. Somehow I managed to find a main road, and although I didn't recognize it, I knew I was at least out of the neighborhood. I followed the main road for a few minutes and there was a guy walking by. I could barely talk, but I managed to ask him if I could borrow his phone. Maybe he thought I would run off with it, so he asked for the phone number I wanted to call and didn't give me the phone. I gave him my mom's phone number, and the fucker put the phone to his ear. She didn't answer. Looking back, it's probably a good thing she didn't, otherwise he'd probably tell her I was tweaking out or something. I gave up and kept following the main road. Miraculously, it led me to the road that I lived on. I didn't know which direction I needed to go, so I picked one and hoped for the best. I recognized more and more, and calmed down a bit, until I reached the light near my house when a cop pulled up right beside me. I waited for the light to cross for what seemed like 10 minutes, hoping the cop wouldn't see that I'm freaking out. I managed to make it home. My mom wasn't there. My brother immediately noticed I was acting weird, and I told him everything. I had no idea what I was gonna say to my mom. My brother calmed me down, and my high was slowly coming down. He told me what to say to her. Around 6:30, she got home and came into my room, and the look on her face said ""How fucking dare you? I'm glad you're home though."" My high was gone, and I told her I'm really sorry and I tried to call her. She was upset but she was ok. The day was over. I still don't think she knows that happened that day. 

The story doesn't end there. For about 2 years after that, I would feel the same sensation of being high again at random times, the same intensity, my life flashing before my eyes every 5 seconds, and having a small panic attack. It would last for about an hour, and I didn't notice any triggers, it just randomly happened. Maybe ptsd? I've talked with a lot of people about it, and they think the weed might have been laced with something else, specifically LSD. I have no idea to this day. I cut ties with the guy completely. Over the years, it has happened again just a handful of times, but only lasting a few minutes, and has happened less and less over time. I also feel like my cognitive abilities and memory have diminished dramatically since that day. I was always a smart and witty kid, but since that day, I'm much slower in thought and whatnot.

Was it laced with something? I've thought a lot about trying weed again, but the thought kind of scares me.

The Shards cause no high. Not from any of the 4 dealers - perhaps they all get from the same supplier and we're all ripped off themselves.

Prices risen like crazy here in Canada due to covid.

Wanted to get 2 8balls off a plug, $500 I kid you not and bunk. An 8ball of my aunt a dealer I thought I could trust $220 and it's bunk - she doesnt do the stuff herself, she could not have known. 2 other attempts at quarters lost me a good $1000. 

I can't believe how much money I've lost. 

Before needing to re-up I bought a particularly good 2 gram shard and it got me high for a week. That's how things SHOULD BE. HE wanted $100 for the shard. $100 a week to keep my addiction going is fine.

It's called the safe supply program, and even I got drugs from it just to try the program out. 

We already have some OAT clinics straight up giving addicts heroin injections, Pharm grade, but some addicts have a problem with that the drug needed to be given by nurse, twice daily, at 8 am, noon or 4 pm. Patients are typically authorized 2 doses daily, and the lining up at the clinic twice daily leads to complaints. Eg. How does one hold a job when they need to devote 2 sessions daily 4-8 hours apart inc. commuting and everything else? This limits participants and leads to program drop outs. It seems, some addicts will turn down free pharmacy grade heroin.

In Canada due to Covid they're doing this safe supply thing. Come positive with any drug in urine and say you're addicted to it. They script you the drug, so you don't have to see a dealer, which helps aid social distancing and spares unnecessary human contact. 

If the drug isnt available in prescription form, they give them similar restricted Rx scheduled meds (what Americans call Controlled meds). Lots of heroin users get at request: hydromorphone, morphine, even fentanyl (patch form only) once blood work shows positive test for opioids and a witnessed test dose of an opioid doesn't induce sedation, extreme intoxication, etc. To indicate extensive tolerance is present. 

Wished I copped some Demerol when I last saw it being sold on the street - $5 each, but they were selling only due to their fame - I knew l could get a Oxycodone pill for cheaper and feel indistinguishable effects. Imagine testing positive for it plus opioid tolerance, getting scripted ADDICT DOSES of Demerol. 

ADDICT DOSES. Did I mention the doses are literally 14x 8 mg hydromorphone 3 times daily? Real pain patients take such amounts in a months time (376/mg monthly, or 42 tablets). The fentanyl in the dope has skyrocketed tolerances, so such scripts weren't uncommon. The price of hydromorphone dropped to $1.50 each 8 mg tablet, from a price of $10 each pre-covid. I bought 200x 4 mg hydromorphone from someone for $60 - the prior street price would have been $1000. $60. I popped like 10 at a time every few hours, for a week, which was nice... My methadone drives my tolerance thru the roof. Orally, 30% of the drug gets absorbed, that's the bioavailability. At 10 dollars a pill days, they were for injection or snorting for (60-100%} bioavailability. But at the price I paid I took a huge cut in how much drug worked in lieu of not wanting to spend time crushing and snorting hundreds of tablets

stimulant addicts get Dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate prescriptions. NO pharmacy grade crack or meth yet.

Sedative lovers get their benzodiazepines of choice. Now, barbituates are also schedule 3 in Canada - but they are unused nowadays and though a script can be written, no pharmacy will stock your Tuinal or Nembutal the script is written for. You could get butalbital and phenobarbital - just needed to have a tolerance to it and a presence in your urine.

I had phenobarbital on hand from my aunt's script. She got a phenobarbital 40 mg/.6 mg Ergotamine/ .2 mg belladonna alkaloids, script and gave it to me, 100 tablets for her menopausal morning sickness. I had a measurable benzo tolerance due to recent life events (just trying to stay off the meth...). I fuck around and take 10 tablets the day before my appt, and like the barbituate buzz. Hence why I've been saving them. I could stay awake and alert on such doses. PERFECT 

So at my appointment, I told them I am a sedative addict and was trying to get off of temazepam, and was taking 10 tablets a day of this phenobarbital stuff. tried to taper. I produced the bottle, aunt shares my last name, bottle has 2 more refills and I say I've taken all if the first 4 fills. I am awake and fine on the 10 tablets (400 mg isn't much of a dose). The doctor at hospital orders me 3x 300 mg capsules (epilepsy doses) to confirm my GABAergic sedative tolerance. Still quite fine, perhaps my ADHD med (it's stimulant) plus the caffeine I took beforehand helped me. He is suspicious about my amphetamines in my system, but I tell him for the past 8 years I've taken the same med, same dose. Any effect it is having is likely negligible.

I am scripted 8x 300 mg phenobarbital. I got a tapering script for 28 days which reduced by 2 capsules a week, week 1; 1 capsule a week weeks 2-4.  At the end I'm on 3x 300 mg daily.

I get another month script after a urine screen showing no other benzos or sedatives. He switches it to 8x 100 mg capsules, week 1: reduce to 6, week 2: reduce to 4, week 3: reduce to 2. script ends and I haven't experienced withdrawals at all at only 200 mg daily.

Last visit he writes 1x 100 mg for a week, 1x mg 60 mg for a week and 1x 30 mg for a week for the last week. After cessation I feel fine.

I had 40mg ritalin and a bottle of wine. I started getting really anxious towards the end of the night so I smoked a joint to calm me down a bit, this has been standard practice for me like every week. However when I smoked the joint I just started going insane. I convinced myself that I was completely delusional and I was completely insane for believing anyone would like me. I convinced myself that everyone thought I was crazy and completely out of touch with reality. I thought I should just check myself into a mental hospital because of how insane I am and how unable I am to see it.   


I am someone who kinda has to work quite hard to keep myself in check and not get depressed. I am generally a very self affirming person and try to be kind to myself at all times and not let negative thoughts slip in. I started telling myself last night that I was so stupid for doing that and all my efforts were completely pointless. I will never be genuinely happy and I should just kill myself because life will never be good.   


I was also hallucinating heaps, they weren't scary, but it felt very similar to a shrooms trip and I was finding patterns and faces on every surface I looked at.   


If my friend was not there to stop me from leaving the house, I know for sure I probably would've killed myself that night or seriously injured myself by jumping in front of cars. I genuinely believed that no one cared about me and I was just seriously deluded for thinking anyone did.  


This is honestly really terrifying to look back on and is so unlike myself. I know people care about me and I am surrounded by amazing, beautiful, supportive people. I'm so scared that this will happen again. I'm going to try really hard to work on my self control and just stick to drinking less than I normally would, without the goal of getting fucked up. I just feel really weird today and was wondering if anyone had any advice on how I could take care of myself so I can go to sleep feeling a bit better.

2nd year of college, me and 4 friends were trying to contact a dealer, he wasn't responding but we went to the usual meeting place anyway. We parked at the front of a park, and got out of the car to wait for the dealer to respond.

Danny, one of my friends, had a burnt apple pipe and a tiny roach in his bag. So, while we waited, Danny took out the roach and sparked it, three of us had 2 hits of that roach before it died out, it was practically nothing. 

Now, what we didn't notice then, was that there was a police surveillance camera mounted on a light pole on the very corner from where the car was parked, and they could see everything we were doing. We waited for a couple more minutes, and decided to get in the car and leave as the dealer never responded. 

I started the car and at the same moment I pushed the gas and released the clutch, a fucking cop car blocks the way and prevents me from driving off. A police sergeant gets out of the passenger seat and demands a vehicle search (you all have to know that the neighborhood we were in is generally a dangerous place). At that time I didn't know what to do, but I didn't have nothing to hide so I accepted. 

They put us against  a nearby wall, asked for ID cards, searched our bags and patted us. I was afraid they were going to find Danny's burnt apple and that's it, but apparently they just let it slide. When it was my turn to get my bag searched, one of the cops (they were 5 in total, 4 got out of the car then one arrived in a motorcycle) whispered in my ear ""hey dude, if you're hiding something, tell me, I might be able to help you"".

In the past few years, I hanged out with my friends, doing some massive drinking nights, and the occasional pot here and there. However, in the past few months I've started spending time with different people, listening to different music, and more importantly, I've started doing speed and xtc, at an increasing rate.

Right now, I am neither worried about taking bad drugs, almost anything I put in my body is checked thoroughly (I have the means), nor overdosing as I carefully measure anything I am able to at all times before diving in. Although in general I had tons of fun so far, last week I did 21 lines and some xtc and all I remember from the night is getting lost without my friends, getting into a brawl somewhere downtown and then subsequently crying to a pair of police officers, who kindly told me to go home instead of taking me in.

That was when I realized I either lose myself in the process (to the point of becoming a junkie, not specific to a substance) or I get into trouble with law enforcement and lose the ability to live my life to the fullest because of the criminal consequences of incarceration (for eg. I'm going to uni this autumn, but if I am convicted I can no longer attend university).

So most dealers that I know who have been busted get caught because someone they sell to gets charged with possession.

If that person has multiple plugs then I feel like they provide wouldn‚Äôt rat on a source for really good/pure drugs and instead rat on a dealer who is less important to them. If you get busted and decide to rat (because you have no morals) would you rather set up the guy who sells pure MDMA and strong gel tabs? Or the guy selling ditch weed and dirty pressies? 

When I used to sell I made sure to give the best customer service I could. Making sure my prices were reasonable, having quality product, never shorting people/throwing in a little extra as well as testing any MDMA and LSD in front of the customer with reagent tests.

I rarely, if ever, take 2. I've never abused them.

 Before 2015 the only illicit drug I had tried were acid and cocain. I'm not a big drug user, just once in awhile and luckily I have never had a desire for regular use.

 Until 2018 I hadn't used any illicit drugs since being prescribed Adderall. 

 In 2018 I kinda went a little drug crazy. Maybe every weekend. I used xtc pills, coke, acid and meth. I never felt the actual effects of any of them aside from meth. (meth made me euphoric, talkative, empathetic and energetic. I can definitely see how people can become addicts) 

 I know the x pills weren't bunk because everyone else was f'd up, coke might had been garbage but who knows, I was the only one doing coke that night. 

 The past 1.5 years I haven't used anything-except Marijuana and my prescribed medications.

 Day before yesterday I took an xtc pill, 20m later took 1/2 and 30m later snorted 1/2, so 2 in total. I didn't feel anything. A couple hours later I smoked weed and totally freaked out (I have freaked out on weed many times without taking anything else) I was seeing trails and weird shit in my peripheral vision. But I think maybe I wasn't and the weed was just tricking my brain, I mean I didn't feel ANYTHING for like 3hrs then I smoked weed.

 What the hell is the deal? Are the drugs bunk and other people are getting a placebo effect, or because I take 20mg of Adderall a day I just can't feel the other drugs.
 I'm looking just for opinions or related experiences , I know nobody can know for sure.

So just to clear things up a bit, on day 1 I have taken a total of 600mg spaced out over the course of a day, then I woke up in the morning on the 2nd day and everything was fine. 

On the 2nd day, I took a total of 750mg over the course of a day. I didn‚Äôt and never would take such high doses in 1 go by the way. Now I went to sleep and slept very well. I woke up on the 3rd day in the morning and that day I knew I couldn‚Äôt take any because I would be driving to visit my dad, so I had to be 100% sober for 2 reasons; driving and visiting family.

However I noticed almost immediately in the morning that my hands would be shaky, and I was just holding my phone in my hand when suddenly my hand got a split second spazzed and basically gave up. I dropped my phone on the floor.

I thought oh well my hand just spazzed, nothing major but Over the course of the day I noticed my hands would be shaky and my hands would be randomly giving up.

I‚Äôm not sure how to explain this, but it literally feels like my muscles just switch off for a second. I tried holding a pen, and unsurprisingly after a few seconds of holding the pen, my hand spazzed and I dropped the pen.

Now I started freaking out thinking already the worst; already thinking it‚Äôs Parkinson‚Äôs, or some other neurological condition.

I knew I had taken pregabalin the day before and thought it could be that, so I didn‚Äôt take any pregabalin for the rest of the day and the spazzing died out towards the end of the day, but nevertheless it still freaked me out a lot.

Could anybody with some knowledge or experience please weigh in on this matter? I am worried, and not sure what to do.

Now I can't smoke again.

I started feeling this terrible, unending nausea and, due to my living situation, couldn't smoke inside which means as soon as I started to feel really ill I stopped smoking and it didn't get worse. I also started treating myself with any anti-emetic (prevents nausea and vomiting) I could get my hands on, including a teladoc visit for prescription strength. It was maybe a bandaid, but I still felt like I was 20 seconds away from puking for days and days on end.

After dropping 5 pounds (so I'm underweight now) in 3-4 days without vomiting at all, I brought myself to the ER for some IV fluids. The proposed diagnosis is Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. Thankfully I was able to talk with my psychiatrist the next morning, who prescribed lorazepam for me. Per the literature I could find in the national library of medicine database, standard anti-emetics (like I had been trying to use for days before going in) do not treat symptoms but lorazepam can control the nausea. I still don't feel okay, but at least I can eat again. 

I want to inform people about this because of how fucking awful my experience was. I didn't even progress to the full episode where you vomit uncontrollably because I am emetophobic (phobia of throwing up) and began the most intense regimen I could to prevent that as soon as the nausea began. But even still, it was absolute hell. 

It starts with something called a ""prodromal"" phase, wherein you feel icky and off but maintain normal eating habits. I don't recall exactly how long off the top of my head, but this can last for a decent period of time before transitioning into an active episode. I caught myself at the transition and prevented a full episode. 

So if any of my stoner friends out there have been feeling off, nauseous, or food averse without any good reason why that might be the case, consider taking a T break for a week or so and watch for improvement. I don't want you to suffer like I've suffered.

When I initially started picking up from him I had to meet him somewhere close by in town to where I live but as he realised I live in the city centre he now just parks up on my street and I go outside, get into his car, have a nice chat, do the exchange and go back inside. Because of this my friends seem to think it‚Äôs really easy for me to get their drugs for them. 

My issues are the: 
 a) waiting around stuck in my house for the guy to turn up (he is quite fast but on a busy night of course he takes longer); 
b) the legal risk- it just takes a police officer to stop me when I get out the car, do a search and what am I gonna do when I‚Äôm caught with three bags? In the UK that‚Äôs enough to get arrested for dealing not just possession, all for someone else‚Äôs drugs that I‚Äôm not even gonna touch; 
C) I kind of think it‚Äôs rude to make somebody else get your drugs when you‚Äôre not only not doing them together but they are literally just coming by to get them and leave; and
D) Yes it is a pain in the arse to go ten minutes down the road and back to the cash machine in the rain when these people want the drugs in advance of them getting to your place. 

My friends all live in another city which is a lot smaller and quieter and it‚Äôs more expensive there so they come to my city where I‚Äôve moved to in the last few years to get me to do it. I do think it‚Äôs a pain in the arse to pick up these drugs just for them to stop by for ten minutes and take them to a whole other fucking city. 

I have even offered to give the guy‚Äôs number for themselves, we‚Äôve got a good, reliable relationship and he says it‚Äôs totally cool. I don‚Äôt mind if people want to come here to pick them up but they contact the guy, they wait, they get their own cash and they get in his car to collect them. But even after offering this they said NO?! ‚ÄòI‚Äôm good thanks you just do it.‚Äô This is where I find it rude. When you can get them yourself but you just want me to do it and risk myself because you just can‚Äôt be arsed? They even say ‚ÄòI thought I‚Äôd just restock while I‚Äôm here, can I call your guy?‚Äô To me you can‚Äôt just think ‚Äòoh I‚Äôll just restock while I‚Äôm here‚Äô if it‚Äôs not your fucking guy. That‚Äôs a luxury you have when you‚Äôve got your own fucking numbers. 

I have had to ask somebody to pick up for me years before I had numbers and as soon as I was given the number for myself I was fucking relieved I was in control of my own pickups so I really don‚Äôt understand the opposite attitude. In my view if you can‚Äôt take the effort and risk of talking to the dealer then you shouldn‚Äôt do drugs. Just look at the risk I took in getting the guy‚Äôs number in the first place. 

Am I being anal or does anybody else here get annoyed when people just expect it‚Äôs easy for you to get drugs for them? Of course if we‚Äôre doing drugs together I don‚Äôt give a fuck I‚Äôll get both of ours at once it makes sense. But just for someone else?

At this time, I did not know anything about the wonders of psychedelics but I knew chemistry. While watching chemistry I picked upon that LSD was lysergic acid diethyl-amide and derived from a fungus,MDMA was 3,4 methalynedeoxymethanphetamine and came from sassafras, and opium came from poppies. I heard the horror stories of PCP causing people to strip nude run into the streets and get into dangerous situations and LSD was just a nice and relaxing and fun adventure. She was wrapping things up and told us about how 3 kids in my county had taken a hit off of someone‚Äôs vape and wound up in the hospital because‚Äù it was laced with PCP also known as LSD‚Äù. This confused me so after class I went up to her and said that LSD and PCP are different substances and she told me ‚Äúwell they are the same because they are both mixtures of heroin and MDMA‚Äù. I had to leave then because I would have been late to my next class but I was furious.   Heroin kills many people and destroys hundreds of families in my county alone and MDMA ,a stimulant, apparently in a mix produce a psychedelic that hasn‚Äôt killed anyone in 90 years.

While we were packing a second bowl I saw a car pull into the back lot, it‚Äôs quite a big area and my vision is poor, so I kept packing thinking it was just a normal car. Once it got within 250-350 feet my friend realized it was a cop, quickly we scrammed to put everything away and my friend said to just act casual and get out and start getting our skate shit ready. The cops parked about 100 feet behind us in a parking spot and just got out of his car and stared at me for a solid 2 minutes as I got all the skating shit out. Now looking back on it, I‚Äôm very glad my friend was there. I probably would‚Äôve panicked.


Anyway for my advice, I would say just NEVER drive away or look very suspicious. Driving away just screams that you were doing something wrong. Try to act like your going for a hike or some shit if you see a cop. ALWAYS remember your rights and probably don‚Äôt seem like your trying to hide a bunch of shit while they drive by.

Will this tiny dose of fluoxetine have any serious effects on my highs/trips, I feel like mushrooms are weaker but I can't be sure. I also regularly smoke tobacco, but haven't smoked weed for years. I've done a fair bit of dxm in the past and want to go again, but don't know if it's safe, will 20 mg of fluoxetine cause serotonin syndrome when mixed with DXM? Will 20 mg of fluoxetine kill or dampen shroom trips? Will it dampen effects of codeine or possibly cause dysphoria? What general effects will 20 mg of fluoxetine have on drugs? Can tobacco cause dysphoria mixed with these drugs? 

I have done some research, but struggle to find definite answers, especially with fluoxetine and with my low dose. I have also been paralysed before from taking shrooms, but I believe this to be a unique condition called WLP (Wood lovers paralysis)

I‚Äôve been off weed nicotine and cocaine for 4 months as of today. I feel like; I feel. That‚Äôs the difference between how I was an how I am. Before. I just was going through existing not as a gift but as a placeholder to something else. It was like I was in the waiting room for death getting closer and closer not caring at all about what has happening around me. I wasn‚Äôt alive. Now. It‚Äôs harder but easier as well. I was high of weed every second of every day for 4 years and by the end of it the only thing I felt was a constant self hatred or numbness to that fact I was addicted to nicotine as well for 3 years vaping an insane amount of 50mg everyday and not taking care of myself or my body. I got into coke my first year of college in the rave scene. Doing a gram of coke every Friday and Saturday night. All this culminated in me being a deeply sad human being, although to call me alive is a stretch. This was all rooted in my psychosis from around 4 years ago where I almost murdered someone on acid for trying to rape me. I couldn‚Äôt deal with it so I ran. But that only made things worse. I started going to therapy and I saw what I was doing to myself wasn‚Äôt okay. That‚Äôs what motivated me to stop what I was doing to myself. First I quit my cocaine habit when coronavirus started. Then I quit nicotine cold turkey. Finally I dealt with my ultimate demon And stopped smoking weed entirely. It‚Äôs been a journey since then. I feel the vast range of emotions of the human expeirence again. It‚Äôs very hard sometimes since I forgot what it was like. I‚Äôve been taking care of myself again. I‚Äôve gotten really back into lifting weights and Muay Thai which I‚Äôve been doing for 7 years. I‚Äôve gained 50 pounds of mostly muscle. I went from 130 pounds at 5‚Äô11 in March to 180 currently. The better I treat myself the better I feel funny hoe that works. Anyways, there is no escape from your problems. You can only face them head on. Your problems are like shadow puppets, they seem a lot bigger and scarier when you don‚Äôt face them head on and only see their shadow. But when you look them in the eye and face that shit, it‚Äôs manageable. There is no escape, but that‚Äôs okay. We are here to deal with our issues and grow because of them.

At this point in time I had just gotten outta jail(again) and had like $800 in my bank account. No job and I had just gotten kicked out of my house for doing drugs after I had a really bad psychotic episode one night and was shooting up ice like crazy and pissing away my money on basically nothing but dope and cigarettes. I hadn‚Äôt gotten anymore than maybe 8 hours of sleep in that two week period so I was constantly on the edge of going into another delusional freak out.

So one morning as I was walking down the sidewalk of the main road in my hometown. Commuters and parents driving their kids to school was backed up further down the road than I could see. I had a plastic Walmart bag filled with some things I had bought and an open pack of needles and as I walked down the road swinging the bag something inside ripped it and all my needles fell out onto the sidewalk right in front that long line of people watching me.

That triggered my psychosis and I started thinking someone had called the cops on me claiming there was some junkie spilling his syringe needles all over the ground. So I fast pace it to my friends house about a half an hour walk away, nobody‚Äôs home, FUCK. So I go and depose of my rigs in the wooded area next to his house but I still have an 8-ball in my pocket. Well I just paid for it and wasn‚Äôt gonna waste it so I straight up ate the motherfucker. Being in that state of mind I didn‚Äôt(and probably couldn‚Äôt) take into consideration the amount I had just consumed. I had swallowed a gram a few nights prior and was fine so I guess I thought I was Superman when it came to swallowing meth. It was the most intense and scariest come up ever.

Tech binges and lucid dreaming. You can drop advice, questions, comments, similarities or just scroll on.  

I have been taking it recreationally at night ~8pm because I don't want to take it during the day and go to work with my eyes blasted. This is generally how it goes. It takes a long time to hit me (XR pills) and I usually fall asleep before I feel it. I'm asleep during the time I would expect to get euphoria and start to have strange ass dreams. I wake up and fall asleep over and over returning to the dream state. Tonight I was dreaming that I was at work (food service) and customers kept buying off menu shit like a container 1/10 full with teriyaki sauce or like a brick of butter? They all had an apathetic demeanor and they knew I was in this Adderall dream realm and were like ""we gotta do this man, I'm not happy about it either"". I totally knew I was dreaming and could decide to stop falling asleep but I felt I had an obligation to them. I wake up, look at the clock, see its like 1am and I tell them in the dream, ""You know it's 1am, right? We closed a while ago."" It is so strange, I'm able to switch back and forth between reality and a lucid dream state seamlessly and consciously. I knew both dimensions (I use that word loosely here) were accessible and ongoing, I could indulge in either. I had a similar experience a while ago where I would ""sleep"" and dream about scrolling through and reading Reddit posts in my head. I didn't recall seeing words, but I could control the scrolling and clicking and I felt the same satisfaction/interest from ""reading"" the posts.  Other times I bypass the dreams and shoot up from sleep instantaneously, high as a motherfucker. No matter what, I end up just staying up all night and the rest of the following day. I feel like I am totally missing out on what this substance has to offer. On the other hand, I never feel productive on Adderall; it makes me want to switch between Reddit, Hulu, Animal Crossing, and porn for hours. So I doubt this could actually be a useful substance for me.

just have a short question about the storage and the potency loss of 1p-LSD. I stored it for over 4 years in a dark place at room temperature. Do you think there is much of an potency loss?

Four years ago I did a 100mcg blotter and felt really uncomfortable. No visuals at all just the walls moved a bit and it felt like everything is breathing. It felt like I was in between being sober and tripping which felt horrible. But it was probably the worst time to do this because I had a really hard time back then.

Now I am feeling much better with how my whole life is going and I want to give it a second try when I am on holidays. Do you think I should take more? I was thinking about taking one and a half tabs (150 mcg - potency loss)? Any further tips to have a nice experience this time?

It was early in the day, around 10am, and I was walking from my hostel about 20 mins to see an ancient temple complex, located conveniently within the city. Google maps took me along some side streets up on a hillside, but only a block or two from the main road of the neighborhood.

As I rounded a corner I came upon a scattered group of people, all Vietnamese, mostly young, who were injecting some sort of orange-ish yellow substance. As far as I could tell they were all within a block or two of each other and not realy hidden from public view, with young children and older folks going about their business at the end of the street. At one point a man got my attention and I gave him a clear ""no thank you"", then kept my head down, and got the hell off that street.

The whole thing was bizzare to see as an American who isn't used to that kind of open hard drug use, especially in broad daylight. Most of the users seemed pretty with it (no one was nodding off or lying on the street as far as I could see) and several were getting on scooters and riding off basically as they were shooting, so I'm assuming it was some sort of speed and not heroin or anything like that, but really I have no idea.

I tried a little bit of coke a couple weeks ago... I figured that would let me know if its still dangerous for me... or maybe I'll just find it not as good as I remember it?
Regardless, getting back into once-weekly sessions on it seems have improved my mental stability.  It seems the coke ""allows"" me to compartmentalise parts of my life... whereas before all the negativity from my childhood was all I could think about day in, day out.
So I'm at a bit of a loss what do do really. I got heavily into psylocybin mushrooms when my childhood issues started to surface (I'm 43 now) - the last mushroom dose I had was that one night of 5 grams. Certainly pushed to the forefront of my mind things that I had clearly been suppressing for most of my life. But again, perhaps that trip was a little overwhelming and my bodys equilibrium was to try a very different drug like an upper just to try and keep me stable...!
I've been diagnosed Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and I am hopefull that I can recover. I have fairly good will power and stamina ( I run about 4 marathons a year) 
I've also tried MDMA solo jst to try and feel some of that old skool magic.
I dont know if anyone has any input because its confused me a little that the coke use seems to be stabilising me, more than any psychiatric medication I've been on.

I should note that I‚Äôm an 18 y/o girl 1.62m 58kg.
I have taken xtc before like 3 times and only rlly had a psychadelic effect when I took 500mg in total (which is a lot i know and never doing that again lol and also was 2,5 weeks ago so is that safe for me to use 6apb now?)

I read so many different stories abt 6apb that I‚Äôm confused now.
Now I‚Äôm not really into psychadelics tbh. Did shrooms once and it wasn‚Äôt the most comfortable experience ever. Its was really overwhelming and made me very chaotic and i kept seeing patterns/shapes on my wall when i came down from it which annoyed me a lot. When I had psychadelic effects on xtc I was paranoid at first bc it reminded me of the shrooms which i didnt rlly like but then i felt at ease again bc of the euphoric and calming feel that the mdma gave me.
But I‚Äôm scared that the psychadelic effect will be stronger with the 6apb which makes me doubt if i should take it or not. 
Also I‚Äôm gonna do it at home. Usually I take drugs in nature or at parties, but now we‚Äôre just gonna chill in my room. I‚Äôm not planning on doing a really high dose, not in the mood to roll toooo hard. 
Does someone has any experience with this drug. How heavy is the psychadelic side of the drug. Is it more similar to the psychadelic effect you get from a (high dosage) of xtc or more similar to the shrooms.
Also I‚Äôm more into uppers so does is have like the euphoric, loving, wanting to dance go crazy effect like xtc?

I don‚Äôt use drugs, and I don‚Äôt generally speaking have a problem with them but my brother‚Äôs behavior is honestly fucking atrocious and I think he‚Äôs too young (just turned 16, has been into drugs since at least 13). I don‚Äôt know how to level with him/if possible or just what to do, so any advice/insight is welcome. Trying to keep this condensed. (it isn‚Äôt tho, sry)

- younger brother began using drugs in middle school (we are from a wealthy area, completely avoidable at the school as in he essentially had to seek it out). began with weed, progressed to shrooms, zanax, who knows what else. parents generally in denial. 

- he began dealing drugs (out of our white suburban home) and bringing sketchy people into the neighborhood. he would deny it, allow the parents to look thru his stuff, and they would find drugs (basically being really dumb about where he was hiding things, i thought maybe a cry for help/attention)

- after a while, parents decided to have him go to rehab. he acted like he was done doing drugs and was going to try finding other hobbies. i could tell it was fake given how much he tried to resort back to his earlier life &amp; would joke abt certain things. 

- got back from rehab, back on drugs. parents had  moved so he could be in a different school district, had to throw away previous private school tuition, taking him &amp; attending therapy, etc

- he ran away, got arrested (nothing happened), is now at home. he leaves everyday to do whatever tf so he is staying in a separate room w/ bathroom etc in an effort to distance. he sometimes comes in the house raging and screaming at my parents, spitting on the floor, etc. the whole house smells like weed the entire day despite me shoving a towel under the only door that connects us to the house. 

- other background: never really liked anything/had goals despite having so many opportunities. acts like he‚Äôs from the hood by wearing a chain, listening to rap music, acting like his life is incredibly difficult &amp; people owe him things despite being raised in a very supportive environment. he got a macbook and ipad ‚Äústolen,‚Äù looking back he likely sold it for drugs. parents don‚Äôt want the cops called bc they think it won‚Äôt be handled well. i agree with not bringing in cops but idk what else to do. i feel really bad for my parents, i can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôve put up with this shit for so long. at the same time, i don‚Äôt have suggestions as to what they can do, so any advice would be appreciated

personally, i think he‚Äôs a piece of shit. i dont hate many people but he is fucking horrible. lying, temper tantrums like a baby, demanding things despite treating things and people like absolute shit. is now 16 so can‚Äôt really be kicked out. he also has clearly burned bridges as he previously had left the house to live with others but is staying here for some reason. i don‚Äôt think anything will change, even if he goes thru rehab, until he hits some sort of bottom because right now he thinks he‚Äôs the shit (i guess). so i don‚Äôt know what options there are. 

also, i don‚Äôt want to sound ignorant or take light of situations involving addiction/individuals who are addicted or have overcome it. i understand it‚Äôs a disease and the only reason i feel so strongly about my brother is his attitude/outlook on life and behavior toward my parents. i think a major problem with my brother is that a) he doesnt see the problem and b) does not want to change. i also know my family is really fortunate to have the money they do to help him (which is another reason his apathy is so infuriating). 

thanks so much.

I‚Äôm currently about to be a sophomore in college. The first time I ever smoked was the beginning of freshman year of high school, and apart from taking some breaks and being grounded I‚Äôve pretty much smoked every day until now. Weed for some reason completely hinders my desire to socialize with other people, and I‚Äôm high most of the day, so I just get pretty antisocial for that portion of the day and I can‚Äôt be the person I want to be. I pretty much just go on my phone and turn braindead every time I get high, but for some reason I enjoy it so much. Also, it destroys my want to pursue hobbies and other activities that I‚Äôd normally want to do. 

I‚Äôve tried quitting, but those ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù have always ended up coming back around and the cycle just starts over again. So instead, I started exclusively smoking at night and that‚Äôs worked pretty well. (Harder to do in quarantine cuz it‚Äôs so boring)

I think it‚Äôs because I haven‚Äôt found a purpose in life for myself yet, and it‚Äôs pretty tough to find motivation to do anything when you‚Äôre living aimlessly. I‚Äôve never had to work for anything in my life, I‚Äôm fortunate enough to have a family with a wealthy enough background, and I‚Äôm smart enough to get by decently in school without putting in much effort. But that‚Äôs fucked up my work ethic, I genuinely have one of the worst ones I‚Äôve ever seen and am extremely lazy. 
My social life is fine, after I first started smoking I found a lot of friends and developed social skills. Still in progress of developing my identity right now but aren‚Äôt we all.

But I just don‚Äôt know where to look in life as of right now, I know I can quit weed, that‚Äôs not the issue, it‚Äôs more of I don‚Äôt know where to go or what to do.

If you want to skip the read then my question is: How drastically can pills affect the way you think? As in, if someone takes pills and goes and stabs someone, is it all the pills or were they just already like that and the pills just affected their judgement enough to cross the thin line?

I'm 16 and my older brother 22. He's been doing drugs since a very young age and I've avoided them my whole life. Pills and weed mostly (past few months mainly just weed) but he used to just use whatever he got his hands on. I won't go in to details to avoid a long post, but he had a very troubling childhood. My mom feels this is her fault so he can get away with a lot of things. Very drastic things. Over the years he's done some crazy stuff like stabbing my step dad, throwing me to the ground and pulling a knife on me, lots of theft, and what brings me to this sub reddit today, when he stabbed one of our family friends. No one has ever been mortally wounded by him, and he's ok(healed in like 5 days actually), but it's still very upsetting and insanely scrary. Please keep in mind I'm leaving ALOT out and the situation is very complicated, he's not just walking around doing crazy things on the daily. Anyways, this is the first big deal with him in a long time and I've matured alot. And I found myself thinking... is his actions really all the pills? If he were stop with the pills, would he really be harmless? Or are these pills just clouding his judgement enough to do these things that he was close to doing anyways? Can a pill really take you from 0 to 1000 like that? Or is it more like he was already and 950? If you get what I mean. 

Please, the situation is complicate, and I'm ok, and my family is ok, and we don't need help. it's getting better. The background just helps you to understand my questions more. I don't want to sound rude, but I would really appreciate it if you didn't lecture me about what I've talked about here. I'm just looking for a detailed answer I can't find elsewhere.

I only get huge cravings when drunk and getting triggered by talking about drugs, I can deal with it. Problem is that I've been unconsiously looking for alternatives. My drinking is a problem again and for the last few weeks me and my friend had a habit of ordering a cocaine taxi. I very much realize this is not a road I want to go down to. I'm too poor for this shit. We both know we shouldn't do this, but I pretty much know we are going to fall down this rabbit hole. He has a real dealer, there is no waiting time or whatever, no contact is way harder this time (and it's indirect via my best friend).

I know she just use me to get high. And, we ain't had sex yet. I actually could, she is down. Problem is, when I get high, I am so high I dont even think about sex at the time.

I tend to stay away from uppers and downers these days, as I struggle with the low energy, drained feeling following a night on cocaine, or a meth binge, in the same way that I get edgy the days after using benzos and achy if I overuse opioids.

These days, I stick to weed as my daily medicine for the soul. A beer on weekend nights. LSD once every few months to revitalize my love of music and to refresh my brain... I don't do much else, though if I was with a friend and was offered something outside of this triad, I would probably accept.

But once a year, often in the middle of winter (Southern Hemisphere), I will take a good dose of LSD and take MDMA. MDMA is an interesting drug. It feels quite good and because of serotonin's role in social heirarchies, MDMA gives me a glimpse at how I would see myself if I was at the top of that heirarchy. My muscles feel tigher, my posture is better. I get 4 hours where I can sit back and love myself.

2 hours after that, the feeling is gone and you're tossing and turning to get to sleep that night. The next morning, you wake up feeling at one with existence. There is a peace, a stillness and quiet within the brain that accepts reality as it is and is grateful for it.

My day started early, I had vaped 7g of weed and ate all of the AVB as an edible first thing in the morning. I spent the day stoned at Sea World, enjoying the fascinating and often adorable sea creatures with the love of my live and future wife. The edible high began to subside when we had finished our tour of the park. We got a late lunch for, up until that point, I had subsisted on coffee and weed alone. I drove home, my girlfriend going to the city to her parents' house and I returned to our home by the beach.

I took on tab of LSD at 4:20pm, took the dog for a walk and came back to have a beer and suck a little vapor off of my new buds. I mostly just laid in bed listening to music with my headphones for the first 4 hours. It was incredible. I am a guitarist and singer and these LSD trips allow me to visualize how songs are engineered to create meaning. So much human history has led us to the point where we can listen to a basically infinite reserve of decades of recorded music while laying in a comfortable bed in a warm, safe house with a cold fridge full of beer. I stared at my guitar and contemplated how many years of advancement led to the creation of such an incredible machine. Humans truly are amazing creatures to have figured all of this out.

I took the MDMA and switched from music to ADV China, a Youtube channel about living in China and the cultural differences between it and The West. It was an incredible experience to contemplate the ideas they discussed...I won't go into too much detail but I recommend the channel strongly. I ended up watching this until the MDMA peak ended and then went HAM on the weed so I could get to sleep.

I do this once a year during winter, candyflipping alone, and it makes me appreciate things and not be too quick to make judgments based on cultural conditioning. It helps me connect the internal feelings I have with the people in my life. It helps me understand why music is such a huge part of my identity.

I always come out the other side feeling a little tired but in a good way. The soul can rest now, the spirit has been satisfied and was allowed to freak freely for one special night alone.

I only wish I could get ketamine for the comedown as, once the MDMA peak ended, the trip started to take a physically uncomfortable turn (particularly the tight muscles and jaw) that some sweet dissociation would easily curb. Alternatively, I wish I had a xanax so I could just get to sleep. I ended up needing to take a couple of antihistamines.

Sorry this is kind of rambly, I'm stoned and scattered.

It was a simple card guessing experiment. Basically I blindfolded myself and tried to guess whether each card from a normal deck was red or black. I did 100 rounds.

&amp;#x200B;

I got 69% correct!

&amp;#x200B;

Basic statistical analysis states that in this Binomial distribution, the probability of getting 69/100 or more cards right just by random guessing is... 1/9276.

&amp;#x200B;

I've studied science and statistics, I know about this. Scientists typically ""reject null hypothesis"" which in this case means ""conclude that this wasn't dumb luck random guessing"" when the P-value is 1% of lower. Many will make research conclusions with P-values as high as 5%.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless, in science, a P-value of 1/9276 will ALWAYS lead to the conclusion.

&amp;#x200B;

WHICH MEANS I AM OFFICIALLY PSYCHIC!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Had many experiences. Heard peoples' thoughts. Heard a voice saying the exact words someone said 2 seconds later. I even have the power to control peoples' minds!

One time I was driving high on marijuana and there was police I was swerving I got pulled over I used my powers to make him go away and leave me alone!

Another time back at 19 I was busted for underage drinking and I was able to use REAL MAGIC to get the cop to remove and destroy the charge he already wrote up!

It‚Äôs recently come to light that he‚Äôs even had these heroin filled pills in the same home as my two kids as he lived with my mother (since our father passed in 2018)  and she babysits my kids.

Needless to say, my mother told him that he needs treatment and his response was that he will just move out.  

Ever since then, he‚Äôs been giving excuse after excuse to my mother and I. He‚Äôs broken into her home but the cops will not arrest him because he was living there.  They said that he has to physically harm her in order to arrest him. 

Since he gave the Officers his photo ID, he‚Äôs now lost it and cannot find it.  He keeps calling my mom and I asking if we can use our photo IDs to sign him into a motel. We know it‚Äôs because he wants to do more heroin because he‚Äôs already taken advantage of our cousin by doing this and inevitably wound up back at the motel. 

I refuse to give him ‚Äúhelp‚Äù for shelter just because he wants to snort more heroin.   I‚Äôll use my ID to sign him into a facility or hospital. But not to enable his drug use.   He‚Äôs now saying if he commits suicide , it‚Äôs my fault.

And ADHD for almost my entire life.

Okay down to the deatils.

I'm looking for hopefully some advise. I started getting ""under the counter"" (if you know what I mean) Xanax pills about a few years ago. My original plan was to abuse them. After taking a ladder right away in hopes of getting fucked up the very first time, my most predominate feeling was, ""wow I don't feel fucked up at all. I just felt like this is what I need in my life and has been missing all along."" I'm focused, not worried about bullshit, I clean my room and do may active activities. I'm so much more productive and have little to no procrastination now. 

I did end up abusing xanax before, but I managed to quit completely almost cold turkey before I realized that you have to ween off. I weened off of it and feel ""normal"" now but this is not the way I want to live my life. When I was on Xanax, I was not euphotic, I did feel slightly happier but I account that to how productive I became. 


Sorry for any runon sentences, can blame the ADHD in part for that.

TLDR: Started taking Xanax not prescribed to me and think I really should be prescribed it.

Any tips, simlar expireences, or any insight at all would be great. Thanks folks!

Hello pharmacologists, scientists, herbalists, or any other pharmacologically astute individuals -

I come to you with a dilemma, as I have scoured the internet for answers and am not sure where else to turn: I have a burgeoning curiosity in the tobacco plant - particularly Nicotiana Rustica, and find myself embroiled in a quest to demystify it.

I grow several of these plants, and experiment with ingesting it occasionally by way of chewing the fresh green leaf with baking soda. This is a calculated risk, and not something I recommend without extreme diligence and respect to the power/risks of nicotine.

As far as I can tell, using the plant in this way avoids or at least drastically reduces any risk of carcinogenicity since the primary carcinogens, TSNAs, are largely created during the curing process, while no harmful combustion products are created either.

From what I have been able to dig up on pubmed, there seem to be quite a few interesting constituents of Nicotiana Rustica aside from nicotine that are worthy of investigation - solanesol and harmala alkaloids not least among them.

I suspect that this powerful plant has been maligned by the way it has been used and processed within the last century, but I've found it often the case that nature is generally more harmoniously balanced and fit for metabolization when not processed, bastardized, and separated from its constituent elements (think refined sugar vs. fruit, cocaine vs whole coca leaf, etc).

Would any of you happen to know of any lesser known beneficial compounds/effects of the tobacco plant apart from what we know about nicotine warding off dementia/potential nootropic qualities? Would taking tobacco in the way I have described likely yield a net benefit or am I just way off here?

Any help would be much appreciated, whether it be your own expertise or to point me in the right direction. Thanks!

For context - I'm 19F, petite, and I smoke a fair amount of weed/drink a lot but I stay away from other drugs. I have OCD and anxiety which has been worse recently and there's a lot going on in my life atm.

This time last year in Amsterdam I tried Atlantis truffles for the first time - I took about 8.5g the first time and 7g the second time (2nd time was about 4 days later). I tripped properly and really enjoyed them, I was with my closest friends although at the peak of the second time I panicked quite a lot, and had about half an hour of really not enjoying it until that wore off and I calmed down. Funnily enough I didn't see any visuals, both times however I felt like I got so much clarity on all relationships I had with the people there.

It's my friend's birthday next week though and the same group of us want to do them again, and I'm considering it. My anxiety's been quite bad recently but I think this is something I really should do, realistically the effects don't last forever and I like the attitude that no trips are bad, just difficult and that proves something. Is this reasonable?

Anyway, my actual question is, for a cautious trip (and considering my low tolerance and small size), how much should I take given that 7g of dried truffles were the perfect amount for me? I'm considering buying 2g and taking 1g and seeing how it feels - at the end of the day I'd rather a very mild trip than a ridiculous one that I'm not mentally prepared for.

Then my friend hit us up to come over at 12am so we snuck this guy in (let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúS‚Äù) and we don‚Äôt really know him I met him one time before but he seems like he is a covey cool person so we discussed an uber and he was buying weed and shrooms. Anyways he showed up, bought shrooms from somebody I sent him, snuck in, and started rolling a blunt on my tray. The weed was gas, I was starting to feel the triple c‚Äôs by the time he got there. Me and A‚Äôs pupils were huge. A was asleep for a long time before S got to my house but I woke A up to eat some shrooms. We all ate shrooms and soon we started feeling the effects so quickly. Soon enough everything became way too overwhelming I could feel every vibration and energy I couldn‚Äôt watch tv as it was putting a weird vibe in the room (adventure time) so I turned off the tv because I just felt my energies were unbalanced. I was all kinds of fucked up in different dimensions and at one point I closed my eyes and I became my higher self and saw my place in the energy universe/dimension. I closed my eyes and my body just sat upright perfectly vertical and my legs were crossed and without consciously moving my arms, it was almost as if something else was building my arms into this perfect position. My hands went together with my palms facing up as if i had a book in my hand. When I was coming up,I started seeing ancient enscriptions. When I was finished being put into that book reading position I was understanding my place. It was a support for something, but the support was in a high place. I basically turned into my higher self, and when I was done with understanding my position it was almost as if I was possessed with my higher self and said ‚Äúeyes are open‚Äù like a robot but in a strong feminine voice. Like a godly gracious voice. I feel I hit a very high plateau at that point but it went down high from there. I didn‚Äôt feel right I was tripping way too hard. I didn‚Äôt eat many shrooms so I thought it was the pills. These are two very different vibes on the drugs and the energy that you get from these drugs are just so far on the spectrum of being mixable to the point where it just was a down and an upper at the same time. It made you wanna pass you but you can‚Äôt actually go to sleep. I started puking into my sink and filled it with puke because I had so much to eat the day of, and then A brought me to the toilet and I puked more in there. I went back on the bed and then I had to go pee so I went to the bathroom and A really had to go pee too so she cane with and I didn‚Äôt even wipe yet and I started puking on my floor in front of the toilet. So basically I was bare ass puking into my toilet and the puke is on the ground and it‚Äôs getting all over the toilet seat and some on my arms and i have to manage to wipe and clean up this puke at the same time so A can go pee. She goes pee and I feel better and we walk over to the sink to wash our hands but it‚Äôs filled with puke so I clean that up and go back to the bed. I‚Äôm trippin so hard but it‚Äôs not good at all. It was a living hell. I was thinking to myself why tf we took those pills, meanwhile S is just watching us tweak tf out and we think we‚Äôre gonna die n shit. I felt like a little souls holding on for dear life. We made the guy leave at like 1 something because I couldn‚Äôt be responsible for having him there‚Äôs and everything was so overwhelming even the crickets outside and I could feel every energy it was just too much. Not good at all. After he left, A and I were trying to go to sleep but we couldn‚Äôt and she kept turning over but I needed her as a heat source. The whole trip I felt like an early human. At one point we brought my cat in there and I understood why humans have such a connection with felines, they are sentient. They are guides. My cat is so cute I was petting him in this algorithm that he understood and it was so easy and he looked so happy and it was almost as if I was communicating with him through scratching encryption lightly on the top of his head. I could also just lay in my bed and hear entities talking to me. I couldn‚Äôt understand them but you could tell there were a lot of different voices trying to talk to em kind of in soft beeps. Mind you this whole trip I was hearing future and trippie redd and there was just a soundtrack playing in my head real music was too overwhelming. I couldn‚Äôt even look at my phone because everything was too trippy. I definately couldn‚Äôt text the guy I liked I wouldn‚Äôt wanna text him while I was in a bad trip. At one point I say ‚Äúsilence is a soft sound‚Äù. A turned over one time and I was like no bitch turn this way. I said ‚Äúyour not gonna die looking at me so look at me‚Äù. I knew what it was like to be just an energy trying not to die just holding on for dear life. Breathing and keeping my eyes open.

Probably about 3 to 3 and half hours in, and I decided to take a bong rip of some 5x salvia extract I got online. 


I took a fairly small rip and instantly felt my body being pulled to the ground. I was sitting on the floor when I took the hit, but quickly I toppled over as drool leaked out of my mouth. 


As I attempted to pick myself back up I began hearing a man and a women talking to each other. And they were talking about me. I knew it was in my head and there weren‚Äôt people around me, but their voices were distinct and clear. It was like wearing headphones and listening to a podcast but it was all in my mind. 

But what were they saying about me? They were laughing. I was their entertainment. They loved seeing me rolling around in delirium. 

They said things like:

 ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt even know we can see him.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook at how fucked he is‚Äù

‚ÄúHe has no idea we watch his every move‚Äù

...

After a minute the things they were saying started to resonance with me. And I began listening to what they were saying. I can‚Äôt remember what they were talking about but I know I kind of responded to something they said, and then one of the voices said:

‚Äúhe can‚Äôt hear us right?‚Äù
...
‚ÄúHey! Can you hear us?‚Äù

I laughed and nodded in a stupor 

‚ÄúI think he can hear us...we should talk to him...‚Äù
...
‚ÄúDo you know who we are?‚Äù
...

And then silence. 

The salvia has already begun wearing off, and the voices were gone. I was alone again. But it felt different. 

I‚Äôm not a religious man, and I know what I heard was just drug induced audio hallucinations, but that experience has stuck with me. 

It gave me hope that maybe there is more out there than meets the eye. The way they laughed at me and talked like they‚Äôve always been watching...maybe it should have made me uncomfortable, but it actually made me feel comfort. 

Tldr 

Took a salvia bong rip while tripping on L, and I heard the voices of god lol. They laughed at me as they watched me drool and roll around on the floor

I‚Äôm not sure if this is allowed but I hope it is. I came here because I‚Äôm looking for advice for my friend. (It‚Äôs actually my friend, not me, lol).  I‚Äôm worried and want to help. 

Okay, my friend is 25 and pretty healthy. She did meth several times this week - Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. Snorted it multiple times a day. Not sure exactly how much she ingested. She doesn‚Äôt do meth regularly - has only done it a few times. She last slept Monday morning and and then last time she snorted meth was Tuesday night. Where we are it is currently around 2:00 PM on Friday.

She is having an awful comedown and hasn‚Äôt eaten a real meal since Sunday (almost 5 days). She has no appetite but has been making herself eat some applesauce, granola bars, yogurt, etc occasionally. Has been drinking water. Her main concerns are extreme anxiety, tingling/numbness in hands and feet, sweating profusely (it stinks), eye twitching, and now some diarrhea. She does not have a racing heart and isn‚Äôt experiencing hallucinations. She is mainly concerned because she hasn‚Äôt slept since Monday morning and cannot go to sleep despite trying the past 3 days. She‚Äôs taken NyQuil, Benadryl, and melatonin at various times. Nothing has worked.

She keeps saying she is scared she is going to die and she doesn‚Äôt know what to do. She almost called an ambulance. I came to see her this morning and am spending the day trying to take care of her. Since she struggles with anxiety I don‚Äôt know how much of this is anxiety and how much of it is the meth comedown. The other times she has done meth, she says she has never been this bad.

A couple questions:

1. What is the best way I can take care of her? I‚Äôm trying to get her to eat and continue drinking water.

2. Is she in any real medical danger? I‚Äôm assuming it is too late for her to overdose since it‚Äôs been 2.5 days since she last did meth. But, are there are other health emergencies that could emerge while she‚Äôs coming down? Anything I should look for? 

3. I have a prescription for klonopin because of my own anxiety. I want to give her one so she can maybe get to sleep. They are 0.5 milligrams. Is it safe to give her a benzo while she‚Äôs coming down? She absolutely needs to sleep.

I apologize if these are dumb questions but my knowledge of meth is limited. I really appreciate anyone who responds with any advice.

I am conducting a mixed methods academic research on digital marketing strategies for psychedelic media and/or content. As well as interviewing professionals who disseminate content relating to psychedelics, I also need to survey people who are interested in psychedelics, or view psychedelic related content (including activist content, scientific literature, memes, podcasts, news etc.).  


If you have an interest in psychedelics then I would really love if you would take the time to fill out the survey. As an incentive, I will donate ‚Ç¨1 per response to MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies), up to a maximum of ‚Ç¨200 (as I am poor).  Please fill out the survey diligently :) .  


This survey will run until Friday 24th July, and I will post proof of my donation to this group on that date.  


All responses are anonymized.   


 This survey has been approved by the moderators.   
(The link is new because I need to count the responses for donating to MAPS, the survey is identical in every way to the PDF and link I sent to moderators, I received notice of approval roughly an hour ago)

I've never declared myself sober before because I've never been dependent on anything to such an extreme. Summer was my highlight for use-- Music festivals, outdoor parties etc. However this year got a little hairy with the pandemic and I noticed a habit was beginning to form. I'm quite quick to assess when something does more harm than it does good, and lately, I've found that I no longer enjoy the thrill anymore. The magic has gone. I don't have the mental capacity to keep pushing boundaries since I've just come out of a depression recently too.

I genuinely want to work harder in all areas of my life and pursue my ambitions and not just have my years center around getting fucked up in summer. I guess the pandemics put a lot in to perspective for me. It's sad though, because eight years is nearly a 1/3 of my life, so you can imagine all those whoadude moments and adventures I've went on seem like a distant memory now. It feels like losing a close friend. I'm still trying to work out whether cold-turkey is the best option, but I'm one of these ""all or nothing"" types so I always feel strongly about committing to my choices.

So before we went out my mom accidentally broke my weed vape thing which pissed me off, which is why I decided to take 2cb. Take note I have dived into the worlds of acid, mdma, speed, weed, alc, xanax etc so this wasnt a big deal. Only thing different is that this is the 1st time I took 2cb in a small dance club, other times were either at home or to Ultra.


I took 0.5 xanax, a few bong rips and a shot of vodka before we went out. And the 2cb pill (advertised as 35mg, but felt like 20mg). Got to the club with my friend and joined 2 girls and 2 guys we kinda know. We had a good night, I was full of energy and felt tipsy so I was buying them drinks. I also had 3-4 beers and a few shots. Redosed with half a pill later. Cool visuals and tracers, music was amazing, no thought loops or anxiety, euphoric etc.

So the club closed down at 2am so we went out. This one girl who we were with has hooked up with my brother a few weekends ago (who has an amazing gf) to which I felt pissed off and left the club. Now this time she was trying to hook up with my friend knowing he has a gf too. I told her how awful I felt about them doing that shit and she gave me a (pity)hug saying how I'm the only real and honest one. Then they went to make out ofcourse and I saw this woman crying infront of the club. She was obviously fucked up and on drugs but I wanted to help. The 2 guys she was arguing with threw a punch at me and I couldn't react cause the police came. They interrogated me but very luckily didnt search me because I had some pills on me and my eyes were saucers.

So this police shit ends and I go back to them and they're still doing their stuff. I ask to go back to a park where there's an afterparty however I get ignored several times. I obviously angrily walked away and went home to bed. Then my friend calls me to come and that he needs me, and my idiotic ass got out of bed, rolled me a joint and took 0.5xan and went to them. Wandered around toen for 30mins and called him 10 times until I found him. Anyways, I asked whatsup and he tells me they wanted me to join. I sit down and lit up my joint and - you guessed it - I got ignored again. We exchanged a few words but thats it. Heard something between the lines that she said she feels sorry for me. I left and he ran to me cause I forgot my wallet and he starts apologizing. Didn't really care much so I took my wallet and left.


So I literally wanted to just smoke that last joint and ask the girls if this is what they are really into. Assholes that cheat and treat them like garbage. I know I'm not even good looking but seriously what the fuck. I'm always the life of the party and try to keep everyone happy but all I end up with is watching the girl I got my eyes on end up with a dipshit... never got the chance to ask her tho.

Early morning on the 9th, from 1 AM through 4 AM I'd dosed Kratom powder (roughly a tablespoon each dose)  about 6 or 7 times while duo'ing with a friend on League of Legends  
After getting somewhat sleepy, I'd decided to call it a night and told my friend I was going to bed  
Around 5:30 AM I'd dosed Kratom once more but this time the amount wasn't measured, likely over a tablespoon if not double  
I decided to eat something after dosing and head to bed but I have an issue with keeping food down, I'd imagine I've been suffering from Anorexia since my Kratom addiction and haven't given it much attention but over the past month I'd been trying to eat better and keep my food down  
After eating, I'd smoked a cigarette (stupid to do since I was about to go to bed) and suddenly my lungs gone numb and I wasn't able to feel my breathing  
I felt a multitude of symptoms so rapidly, especially overwhelming anxiety and panic (which is why I'd thought this was just a panic attack) followed by light headedness, weakness, vomiting, chills, pins and needles, hyperventilation and tremors / muscle spasms  
 I'd called my girlfriend (thinking it was a panic attack) and she'd spent two hours helping me breathe, It's needless to say I'm positive she just saved my life and I made her aware of that yesterday after finding out from a friend what I'd experienced was an opioid overdose  
Fast forward to the 13th, I'd decided to go to the hospital since I've had shortness of breath ever since experiencing this  
I stupidly didn't mention I'd taken any drugs and was positive I'd experienced a severe panic attack  
The doctor did blood work, xray, EKG and a urine test  
After spending a few hours in the hospital I overheard the doctor say ""Get the discharge papers ready for room 23"" which I'd known was my room  
The doctor came in before I was discharged and sat down and said he'd ruled out all the worst case possibilities and everything looked fine  
I was discharged and it's now the 17th, I'm still experiencing shortness of breath which (I'm a sufferer from anxiety) has worsened my anxiety tenfold  
I've been unsure if I should go back to the hospital (given the pandemic we're in) and tell the doctor I'd gone suspected of a severe panic attack and realized it was actually overdose  
I'm not sure if it's necessary or what that might do for me and would like to avoid catching COVID-19 as much as possible (I live with my grandma at the moment)  
 

I've been crippled by my anxiety, staying in bed all day everyday trying to sleep as much as possible waiting for my lungs to recover so I don't get up and experience shortness of breath and freak out anymore  
I've tried to limit my Kratom consumption down to the minimum which has caused minor withdrawal symptoms (depression, increased anxiety, body pains, stomach discomfort) and as of right now I'm a whole day sober  
I want to get off this stuff, I've been using heavily for months now but have been using for over a year, going on two years

Over the past two months I‚Äôve been having esophagus problems (being able to swallow food) 8/10 times I would eat. And food would get stuck, making me extremely uncomfortable. I would proceed to try to vomit. But it would never come out. I‚Äôve been regularly smoking weed to help my appetite and anxiety, but now my pcp has prescribed me Reglan 10mg (metoclopramide). I ended be able to eat fine the first time on the medication. After trying to do a lot of research on google. I couldn‚Äôt find a post about the effects of reglan and weed combined, so I smoked two and a half hours after taking the dose. I slept for a total of 6 hours 20 minutes after taking my dab. But I woke up feeling extremely spaced out and stiff, which were original side effects of the Reglan. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs safe to continue to smoke but my anxiety will begin to build and I don‚Äôt want to take actual antidepressants because I‚Äôve been on them before and they make me awful.

We all did.

He always seemed to have the realisation, told us about how the drugs were destroying his life and what he wanted to change and we said we're here if he needs us. 

Nothing ever changed. One moment he wanted to stop speed, an hour later he would be railing a fat line. One moment he saw how being constantly high on weed stopped him from getting a job, the next evening he would built a bong out of plastic and aluminium foil.

He said he didn't like psychedelics, didn't like how they felt. Two days ago I learnt how he candyflipped alone in his room twice.

He said he wanted to be sober but hasn't been a day for almost two years.

He stopped having coherent thoughts. He sometimes doesn't recognize his friends anymore. He can't speak in full sentences anymore. 

But there are new thoughts, new ideas. People on the street want to kill him. There is something under his neighbor's bed. Someone on the roof spies on him.

I can't trust any of his words anymore. What did really happen and what was just psychotic delusion? 

He first lost his girlfriend who wanted to get her life back together and he kept pulling her down.

He lost all of his sober friends because all he wanted to have in common with his friends was drugs.

He lost his flatmate who had to live with his antics and unwillingness to get help for a year and can't take it anymore.

He lost his father after moving out spontaneously, not taking his things, just going and not saying goodbye. 

He lost his siblings who his parent have to keep away from him whenever he comes, or they have nightmares about him dying after everything he tells them.

He now is losing his mom, the person who cares for him the most, who just found out weeks ago how bad it has really gotten and is breaking over wanting to help him.

We can't force him to get help. He is an adult.

I want to shake him, scream at him, lock him into a room until he is sober. But it's his decision. 

He is hanging by a thread.

It‚Äôs been a short lived 4-5 years of drug abuse but I‚Äôm finally ready to throw in the towel. Last night ruined me.

For some context - towards the end of 2019, I started smoking weed pretty heavy. I‚Äôve done a lot of other drugs in bulk amounts, but not really weed. I was blasting through maybe an 1/8 a day at first but then that slowly got to more and more, until I was easy doing a Q of high grade American imports a day to myself, and that was the days I would consider I was ‚Äúnot smoking‚Äù. I would chase and taste different high quality strains, really strong shit in really high amounts, and I never greened out or went loopy. 

In about March of this year, I stopped smoking and moved back home, and I haven‚Äôt smoked since. I went to a party last night and my mate really wanted to get high with me, so I bought some shitty home grown hydro off an old dealer friend. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever smoke weed again:

I shared a 4 gram doob with my mate. I had about half of it and he had like 4 hits, and then we put it out and went back to the group. It rocked me. I started tripping in a hyper realistic way, sat down around a fire and thought everyone was talking to me and started talking shit - like abusing me and making fun of me for all types of shit. I just sat there and took it for an hour and a half and then went to lay down and I could still hear them out the window carrying on about me. There were about 15 people and I remember everyone and everything they said - I was wide awake. I kept asking myself if it was real but I was able to interact with them and talk to them and they‚Äôd respond. I went home with my girlfriend and when we were laying in bed, I asked her what I was doing the whole time and she said I was just sitting on the couch blankly staring out into no where and I looked really upset. The trip was so realistic I genuinely didn‚Äôt realise until this morning that none of it happened, and I‚Äôm literally so scared to even smoke a cigarette anymore. I need to sort my life out.

I don‚Äôt use illegal drugs, but in high school and college I had a bit of a problem with adderall. Ever since I stopped taking it I‚Äôve been on the search for something I could legally take that would help with my lack of energy and general will to live.
Enter: Red Dawn energy shots!
They were great! Tons of energy and no noticeable crash, they could get me through an 8 hour shift of selling adult products on my feet easily and I‚Äôd have enough energy to work on art commissions when I got home. I was taking one shot every few days, and now that I‚Äôm unemployed I had no real reason to purchase them. It‚Äôs moving time though and I needed some energy to pack up, so I drove down to a gas station to purchase my ol reliable energy shot, and they didn‚Äôt have it in stock. The clerk showed me some pills, said they were the same thing but in pill form! They looked like they had the same packaging and everything. I checked the website with the product info and it was legit so I purchased them. I chose to take one while my husband showered before going out with the boys so I could get stuff packed while he was gone.
A few minutes after taking them I got this burning pain at the tip of my right ear, but I have a tooth ache on that side at the moment so figured it may be related to that. That was probably the last clear thought I had before the burning spread to my whole face, down my neck, chest, arms, and to my finger tips. I got insanely dizzy, brain foggy, and weak in the knees and figured it was due to me not eating today, so I ate about 2 bites of a graham cracker before my husband walked out of the bathroom and freaked out. Apparently I was tomato red and had a butterfly rash on my face and my knees were extremely red and rashy.
I have an autoimmune illness that causes skin inflammation around the joints and face, it‚Äôs been in remission for over 10 years now, and this looked like a flare up. After checking my temp and heart rate we rushed to the ER thinking it was in fact a flare up and they got me in extremely fast.
They did an EKG and took tons of blood and gave me a butt shot of something to calm me down. It took about 2 full hours for the redness to begin going away and for the burning to subside.
Folks, when I say it felt like my upper body had been held into a flame I am not exaggerating. Once I had calmed down enough to type properly I looked up some of the ingredients listed and DING DING DING: niacin.
I am a 97lb 5‚Äô 21 year old female, the upper daily limit of B3/niacin is supposedly like 38mg with toxicity possible starting at 30mg for some people. The pill I took claimed to have 50mg, and it may have had way more than that considering it‚Äôs not regulated.
I read that niacin flush occurs when taking large doses and can cause hot prickling in some.
Finally the nurse came back in with test results, turns out I was experiencing a perfect storm of malnutrition, low potassium, potential allergic reaction to unknown ingredients, and vitamin B3 toxicity. By the time I was discharged I could walk pretty decently and had drank a crap ton of some nasty nutritional drink with potassium, the redness was almost completely gone, and the pain had subsided.
Has anybody else experienced this, or had any weird experiences with red dawn products?
On a final note: It scared the crap out of me, please read up on things you put in your body before doing so, don‚Äôt just assume it‚Äôs the same as another product just bc it looks similar or someone else said so. Don‚Äôt be a dummy like me.

Now, I‚Äôve smoked weed for the past few years and never had a problem not feeling it. Same with inhalants and opioids and benzodiazepines and DXM etc.

As it stands 50 years after it was passed in 1970, federal law classifies 1000‚Äôs of substances into five of the following categories:

||Potential for Abuse|Accepted Medical Use|Potential for Addiction|Examples|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Schedule I|High|No|Never safe to use, even under medical supervision|Heroin, MDMA, DMT, LSD, Mescaline, Magic Mushrooms, GHB, Marijuana|
|Schedule II|High|Yes, with ""severe restrictions""|Abuse can cause severe physical and mental addiction|Cocaine, Adderall, Codieine, Opium, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Morphin, Fentanyl|
|Schedule III|Medium|Yes|Abuse can cause moderate physical addiction or severe mental addiction|Ketamine, Buprenorphrine, Steroids|
|Schedule IV|Moderate|Yes|Abuse can cause moderate physical or mental addiction|Xanax, Klonopin, Valium, Ativan, Tramadol, Modafinil|
|Schedule V|Lowest|Yes|Abuse can cause mild physical or mental addiction|Cough suppressants with small amounts of codeine, substances with small amounts of opium, Cannabidiol|

This model of understanding the riskiness of drugs suggests marijuana can fuck your life up to the same extent as heroin, while cocaine and opioid pain killers ‚Äúcan be addictive sure, but as long as you don‚Äôt ‚Äúabuse‚Äù them, you couldn‚Äôt possibly be worse off than you would be after a light shroom or acid trip.‚Äù Never mind the fact that alcohol and nicotine aren‚Äôt even scheduled.

For this reason, many of us here in the states have next to no trust in the official federal understanding of the risks involved with the drugs listed above, and each of us are left with our own understanding that has been influenced by lectures we‚Äôve gotten from our parents, PowerPoints given by public school guidance counselors, trip reports online, stories from our junkie friends and, ultimately, personal experiences.

My question to anyone reading this is how would you ‚Äúreschedule‚Äù each substance according to your own understanding of them whether that understanding has been influenced by personal use, a family member‚Äôs use or what you‚Äôve read or heard from friends and even strangers online?

More people are learning about their medicinal qualities, and they're finally being put in clinical trials. Their potential for healing people is immense. Having LSD and Psilocybin available in a safe, clinical, setting will help so many people.

Historically, hallucinogenic substances have been used in conjunction with religious rituals for as long as man has been around. They were used as an aid for spiritual and mental growth. In an environment where it was commonplace, negative side-effects were mitigated because the substance was respected.

Long after all that, the illegalization of these natural psychedelics has caused immense damage. We all know this. But there's a symptom of this problem I believe needs to be discussed more:

The VERY real risk of drug induced psychosis, and getting fried from tripping too much.

The response we've given as a community to the illegalization and stigma of using psychoactives has been a welcoming one. We need a safe haven for conversation about the use of drugs. A place where we can learn how to not overdo it, or to just be smart about doing it. A place to hear and tell incredible stories, and get advice from many different people.

What we don't need is people reaffirming people's psychedelic 'realisations' that consistently show a lack of grasp on reality.

Like we all get it. Theres more to reality, its not at all what it seems, and its all subjective and perspective. But there is too much encouragement for being derealized, and not enough encouragement for reasoning through psychedelic epiphanies.

There was a post on r/DMT where someone said they felt like they 'broke' reality. He said that because of his experience, he had a strong sense that his mind was broken. He said he was living in constant fear of his inner demons. He had a useful takeaway from the trip about his strengths and weaknesses, and what his inner demons were, but his mental state was just fucked up.

People in the comments were all just quoting philosophical stuff that goes along with that kind of experience or talking about the beauty of it. While there is truth to be found, that person undeniably had drug induced psychosis.

Its easy to come off like a dick telling someone that. But someone needs to be there to suggest people seek out professional help. Especially when someone is showing obvious signs of derealization and mental peril. He replied to my comment a few days later saying he realized he needed help, and I told him to go for it.

Ive been through mania and psychosis myself, and I dont want to see more people end up like that because no one is suggesting getting help. Its not about devalidating your experience.

I find it weird that weed, which used to be a drug that relaxed me and put me in a good matter no matter what (with an exception of one time, where I took too many bong hits and got the spins), now makes me paranoid, nauseous (I don't vomit), and unsettles me. Maybe it's because I've recently been diagnosed with acid reflux, so smoking doesn't help with that, but I've also tried edibles and vaping recently. And it's just not as enjoyable experience as it was before. 

It could be because I started using weed last year, and I developed a high tolerance rather quickly. I got into edibles/dabs/bong hits not long after I smoked joints/blunts. And I did shrooms and acid not too long after that. 

I'm not exactly looking to turn to pot again (in a way, it's a good thing weed isn't the center of my universe like it was at point, although I was never addicted), but it'd be nice to enjoy a few puffs from time to time with friends. Now my stoner friends are cool and will hang out/talk to me sober, but I miss that being a pastime with certain friends, you feel?

Since I was about 15 and a half, I have smoked weed a lot.  I was smoking multiple times a day, everyday, for probably about a year(16-17), then I took a 30 day break, smoked once, and then I got 90 days clean, then relapsed weekly in February, and eventually daily use once covid hit. I am currently slowing down, eventually cutting it out and switching to delta 8 and CBD. I smoke for chronic pain with my broken back.


However, since kindergarten, I have been on stimulants (adderal, focalin, Vyvanse, etc), and from k-5, would take an extended release, and 2 instant releases throughout the day, and until freshman year, I would take 1 instant release after taking my extended release throughout the day. I am a fairly smart kid, but I was wondering what the effects on these drugs have had on my brain. 

Personally, I would think that weed is much better than taking my fucking stimulants, as they make me feel like shit and I'm pretty sure I've developed an eating disorder now from taking them when I was young and not eating. What are your guys thoughts on this? I mean, I'm assuming my brain is more fucked up from 10 years of stimulants vs 1-2 years of weed, but I thought I'd get different opinions.

I took them spaced out throughout the night. My roll was normal throughout the night  and  next day I had the worst hangover and was throwing up. Not learning my lesson the next night we went to get more and we took in total 2 blue Kobes ecstasy. It was spaced out but 
Everything was fine untill we decided to pop the second pill

That‚Äôs when everything went down hill: my boyfriend started having a bad trip, imagining things and mixing reality with his dreams, he said he saw lines in my face, and seeing him in a bad state triggered me to have a panic attack.

The next morning everything seemed fine, but I now I seem to have severe anxiety over small things. My heart also seems to be beating harder, not like it‚Äôs faster.

While delivering food for a small mom and pop a couple years ago, one of our regular customers and good tippers asked if I smoked, to which I said yes. He offers me an edible gummie that I gladly accept and take immediately and tells me to hit him up for bud. Edible was extremely potent so I started getting my weed from him. Now I've been to dispensaries and let me tell you his weed in an illegal state was top shelf dispensary bud 100% and somehow he moved so much he sold it at 50/q 175/o. Obviously I kept buying off him and developed a relationship since unlike most dealers I've had he ALWAYS smoke me up. In fact he insisted on it, to the point he started texting me to come smoke when I wasn't even buying bud. So couple years go by and this continues, he was always a cool dude, we would smoke play ps4, pool whatever. Now the guy is probably double my age, but had a family daughter included, never seemed off, until Covid. Couple months ago he started getting weird, I didn't really think much of it at first, since he was always so cool, but when I told a couple friends they got completely freaked out and I realized something was way off all the sudden. Recently he began asking me to chill way more often, and tried to get me to take shrooms with him which I declined, but said you do you man. Whole day he was cool and then I go to leave and his dick is hanging out. Again looking back this is wayyyy off, but at the time I was stoned and getting hooked up he even gave me free bud sometimes so I just kind of ignored it and figured somehow he didn't know because of the shrooms even though I've done way higher dose than he took (microdose) and was on my way and hit him up the next time I needed weed. So I come through and again all normal, until I'm pretty much ready to go and we stop playing video games, and he puts on netflix. Now I'm not trying to watch Netflix, but I figure whatever I'll just chill another hour and smoke. This mf starts trying to literally play footsie with me and I'm extremely uncomfortable. I really don't think he's gay because he has a daughter and has had girls over in the past, always bragging about them, but somethings just super off. I manage to get out of there without offending him, but figure it's only gonna get worse so I was gonna find another dealer. Couple days later he texts me to see if I wanna smoke and I say ""nah bro can't no money for gas"" to which he says check your cashapp and cashapps me $100. Now I'm super freaked out because he deadass tried to pay me $100 to hangout with him. I decided this was all a sign from the universe to teak a break off weed and save money rebuild my tolerance cause I never really took a break, but my friends told me he was trying to rape me. I thought I was being paranoid, but what do you guys think? Did I make the right choice. Weed is great, but it's not worth risking my life. He also like to fuck around with throwing knives and pretend to throw them at me which fucked with my high brain too. I think I made the right choice, but idk. He's still been trying to call and text me, but I blocked his number and whatnot.

So my 3-months for MDMA had passed and I was gonna roll again. Took 100mg followed by 50mg for a re-dose. Once I started feeling the comedown, I smoked what I thought was \*a little\* weed to try and relax me a little and help me sleep. Well... I wasn't relaxed.

At first, it felt awesome! Brought my roll back up and was vibing hard. Then, soon after, closed-eye-visuals started getting insane. Like more intense than most psychedelic experiences I've had. My whole closed eye vision was dancing rainbows and figures. Then, shit really hit the fan.

I had synthesia to an extreme degree. I was seeing everything I heard and thought. This was cool, but then, the worst part happened. I had the worst memory loss of my entire life. I couldn't hold onto a train of thought for more than 2 seconds. I would be thinking of a short sentence and forget what the beginning was halfway through. Even trippier was I was seeing my memory too. I saw a dark grey line, with a short section of the line light grey. It kept moving, but the sections stayed the same length like that was my current memory. I could go up or down or whatever, but only hold in that tiny light grey line of information at any time. I couldn't talk at all during this other than short words, like ""memory"".

I was really annoyed because I was using the MDMA to have deep convos with my girlfriend at the time, but after the weed hit, I just couldn't function at all. It was kind of cool at first, but I just couldn't handle the memory loss. I had no clue combining MDMA and weed in the way I did would cause that at all.

Anyone else have any similar experiences?

Background: I've never fainted in my life and have been a regular user of cannabis for around 3 years (although increased use with the pandemic). Last night, I took a few hits and then thought ""okay one more"" before getting ready for bed and about 15 minutes later I noted the effects to be a lot stronger than normal, went to get some water and all of a sudden my vision went black and I just collapsed. My lovely mother tried to help me up (25 y.o. female; &lt;100lbs) and it resulted in me standing for like a minute, mumbling and dropping right back down the floor. This happened once more and I finally came to and quelled her panic to avoid ambulance drama. Basically the whole episode felt like I was on something way more trippy than just bud. Once I was done fainting, I was weak af, got cold sweats, and had muscle spasms.

I haven‚Äôt tripped for about 2 years prior to this. Back then though, I used to trip on acid a lot; about once a week or two and in the wrong conditions. As a result I was having a lot of bad, downright traumatizing trips. I‚Äôve tripped on acid roughly nine times in total as of right now and only one of those trips was genuinely satisfying and blissful, and that was the first time I ever did it.

When I took it last night, I was truly hoping that for once I would experience some sort of relief or bliss, but lo and behold, despite me making sure all of the conditions were right this time and fully preparing myself properly, the trip was actually very disappointing, stressful and challenging. And the worst part is, I don‚Äôt even feel like I got much out of it. It literally feels like I got the shit kicked out of me for no reason. I tried surrendering and listening to what my thoughts were trying to tell me but everything was just very foggy. I felt like there was things about myself that I needed to work on but I couldn‚Äôt figure out what exactly they were for some reason.

So now I‚Äôm here, sobered up and sad, wondering why, despite me making sure my set and setting were golden, I can never seem to get a blissful or enlightening experience from LSD no matter what I do. Maybe my expectations were just too high, or perhaps I just overprepared myself for this trip, but if anybody had any tips or advice, I would greatly appreciate it, because I‚Äôm just not sure what to make of this trip.

I do have a lot of experience with DXM tho. when i started using DXM it was an amazing experience with lots of euphoria, anxiety relief, floating/soaring feelings and at times being transported to different worlds/to space. I loved it but eventually that high turned into something less pleasant, more disorienting and tense/anxious. anyway I hadn't done enough searching to know the difference between the isomers or that there was one at all and went ahead and bought some ketamine of the S+ variety. I have heard its less euphoric and sedating, which is kinda what im after with this drug. so my main question would be is there any euphoria or feelings similar to the ones I described with the S+ isomer (especially sedation/anxiety relief)? even a little? how would you compare each variant to DXM? and do you think i would enjoy any of the variants at higher doses given my aversion to DXM nowadays?

I am pretty experienced with LSD. I've tripped multiple times. Recently, I bought some paper tabs, which I haven't had since I first tripped a long time ago (ever since then, I've bought gel tabs). These tabs are dosed at 150 mics, so it's on the 'stronger' side for a hit. I tripped yesterday and took one paper tab (I usually just do one hit every time I trip) and honestly, the visuals fell very short in my opinion. 

I felt my body high was on par as per usual. However, I can't help but wonder if maybe paper tabs are just somehow not as effective as gel tabs, even at the same dosage? It had been over three weeks since I last tripped before yesterday, and was also theorizing it could be that I tripped too soon after my last one. I understand tolerance builds and last for about (or up to) two weeks with LSD, so I thought 3 weeks was quite enough time to wait, hence why I am leaning towards paper tabs just being generally less effective. Anyone have any thoughts?  


Additionally, I have been thinking that perhaps it's about time I increase my dosage to maybe 2 hits for a trip, but I am again overall very satisfied with the body high I received, so I'm not sure if I'd like to increase the intensity that much more.

I'm 19M living in Canada. Like a lot of people here, I'm a pretty heavy weed and nicotine user (I juul) and I drink fairly often too. Haven't experimented with other stuff outside of shrooms and acid (which I love) and DXM (meh). Basically, I feel that as young adults with a bit of freedom, it's super easy to be drawn into consistent substance use. Saying that's kind of obvious, but I feel like it's more embedded into life than most realize. Going to your friend's to smoke is just a casual thing to do for plenty of people, it's not overly using a substance. Drinking heavily at a party or bar is what everyone does, it's not substance abuse. Of course the message here isn't that any type of use is bad; it obviously isn't. Pretty much any substance is fine in moderation and this post isn't trying to dispute that. I just feel like young adults are susceptible to using too much too quickly because of the culture. Smoking a lot of pot has been fine for many people but I doubt your lungs will be squeaky clean. Alcohol is legal across the world but everyone knows what it can do to your liver. I haven't even gotten to vaping. Say what you will about the health effects of it, but it really hasn't been around long enough to do a legit study about long term usage, and no matter what that's a risk. Part of me feels like this is sort of pointless because most people assume young adults do the most drugs anyway. I guess it's more of a message to the massive amounts of young people looking to get fucked up. I love doing it too. However, for everyone's sake, take a step back and look at how much your life revolves around drugs and how much you're using.

28M, first time poster, similiar coctail having peer finder, just starting to thinker; hello!

I've started to wonder if the daily drug pile prescribed to me is going to make my brain some kind of ameba some day.

I'll start from the myalgia I'm having, first I was prescribed 300mg of Gabapentin for my nerve pain, then 2x 300mg and going up to day when I take 800mg x 3 per day. It works, yeah, but I still feel the pain. It kinda takes only the sharpest edge away and makes my life from that point of view bareable. Still I wonder if taking like almost three god damn grams of this shit to live is healthy? Hell, if my head aches, 800mg of paracetamol takes that away completely. So this stuff really isn't that powerful isn't it? No alternatives have been prescribed till this day and I have eaten that stuff for years, can't even remember.

My myalgia is speculated to come from head trauma I had, which also did bring me these spasms and ticks. So Klonopin from that, starting low, 2mg per day now. Effective yes, takes all the spams and ticks away but really? It's prescribed as me for life, which sounds wild.

So at this point, I have two drugs doing their stuff on both GABA receptors alfa and beta I think. So they are working me to be calm and giving no fucks about anything. Can't really be shook by anything even though these are my neurological pain / spasm drugs.

But then comes fucking severe ADHD. Prescriptions have been changing for years now from 10mg IR Dexedrine X 4 per day to 10mg IR Dexedrine at morning with 70mg Vyvanse (with which I have settled for now). So up we go with these amphetamines!

Also some hydroxyzine (100mg per day) for atopic skin and itching but that's not too strong stuff. Though it's sedative and hypnotic drug so down we go again.

Also now and then my scholiosis brings me severe pain and I have to take some Tramadol for it but I try to avoid that shit with good ol' stretching and sports. Not in daily usage, but I can get it if I want from doctor which I think is irresponsible because I'm on amphetamines.

***TLDR***; I'm taking 2400mg Gabapentin, 2mg Klonopin, 10mg Dexedrine, 70mg Vyvanse and 100mg Hydroxyzine per day. Am I going to be fucked up vegetable before my 40's?

Keep in mind, I was at a party. I was pretty drunk and did a couple of decent sized lines of coke. What happened from what I remember, is we hit a big line of a blow. I was feeling good. Then out of nowhere my buddy dumps a line of ketamine on the phone. Ive done ket once before but did it in small bumps and I enjoyed it a lot actually. So I'd never done a line of k like this before. It was a big enough to be considered a decently fat blow line. 

I didn't think twice about hitting the fat line. I hit it. And after this I only have one memory. But what I was told what happened was, we were in the car. My friends came to check up on me and my friend (he also hit the k) and they opened the door and I fell right out. Then I walked towards the house and went inside and couldn't walk or stand. So I was just paralyzed on the ground apparently. Someone picked me up and laid me on a bed to chill out. This is where my memory comes in and I remember being on the bed feeling extremely drunk without the nauseous feeling. Everything was fuzzy and spinning and I couldn't get up from the bed or focus on anything. So I just chilled there for a bit till I decided to go back to the party. I was still really fucked up but more chill. It wore off about 2 hours later. Basically best way to decide it was I super drunk without having to puke. 

I don't know how long the blackout lasted but is this normal? I think I blacked for an hour and then it wore off 1.5 hours later ?

I've received a job offer from one of the leading aerospace engineering companies. It's literally a life changing opportunity, and is absolutely my dream job. 

I have not consumed any cannabis in over 40 days now. I took another home drug test this afternoon to see if I would pass, and I failed it. I even tried drinking excessive amounts of water to dilute the sample, as well as taking Zinc which is supposed to help mask THC. 

I honestly don't know what to do. I figured that, by now, I'd definitely be testing clean. I have some body fat and was smoking concentrates daily, so I'm assuming that is the reason why I'm still not able to test positive.

My oxy habit began by chipping oxy 30s once a month, but the frequency gradually increased to daily use 4 years later. I was always careful not to chase the high, so even 4 years later, I had only increased to 45mg / day.

Once I hit daily use, I became concerned that I was a true addict (LOL) and went to an addiction doctor who prescribed 5mg Suboxone (4mg in the morning, and 1 mg for insomnia which didn‚Äôt help much). I didn‚Äôt realize at that time how large a dose this was compared to my 45mg / day oxy use. I hated being on the subs, and I had also recently learned about ibogaine and how it was much more effective on short-acting opiates. After several months of suboxone use, I decided to self-wean back to oxy. It was then that I realized all my efforts to keep my oxy dosage at a ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù level were for nothing. I now needed 200mg minimum per day to stave off withdrawals.

I had a terrifying but mostly successful ibogaine experience at the beginning of this year, and I‚Äôve managed to stay away from oxy since then. Unfortunately, the ibogaine didn‚Äôt relieve PAWS symptoms like it does for many, so after a few months, I could no longer deal with the anhedonia and lack of energy. I started taking stimulants (alternating Vyvanse and Adderall), justifying it to myself because I have ADHD. I have a lot less control when managing my stimulant use than I did with oxy, so I can take 150mg+ Adderall / day at times. This leads to a horrible crash which I treat with Lyrica and (recently) kratom as well as benzos or Ambien for sleep.

I feel I‚Äôm in such a worse place now than I was when I was taking 45mg / day of oxy. Even if I had let my dosage increase slowly, it would have been maybe 10 years before I was at the same 200mg / day level I was at post-subs. Oxy helped with energy, anxiety, and mood, and I was able to afford the habit. I have a wife and kids, and I didn‚Äôt keep any of this a secret from my wife. I‚Äôm now taking many substances to deal with these issues, and I feel these drugs are doing much more damage to my long-term health than oxy ever was. I also feel like I‚Äôm a worse husband and parent now than I ever was on oxy. My wife has no idea how much my stimulant use has increased, and I hate that I‚Äôm now being dishonest with her about my substance use.

I know this is my mind trying to justify using oxy again, but I‚Äôm having a difficult time countering its arguments. If an oxy habit is something I can afford, can keep dosage in check, and don‚Äôt have to keep it from my wife, how is that not a better solution than heavy stimulants + pregabalin + benzos?

Usually just one (a rather big one, though) joint in the evening. The whole pandemic thing made it so that I'd start smoking throughout the day, and my consumption skyrocketed. In the end I was roughly smoking $600-800 worth of weed per month.

Due to that (and some other events) I had to stop, so I did three weeks ago. I feel much better then I did in the beginning and start to feel much more in touch with myself again. It's fucking great.

However, I never really ditched the habit, just the substance, i.e. THC, because I still smoke CBD in the evening. Honestly, it gives me like 90% of the feeling ""real"" weed gave me, it helps me to relax and satisfies my habit.

But since it still contains a lot of cannbinoids I'm not sure if this prolongs my recovery, especially when it comes to my mental quickness and dexterity. I haven't found any reliable information elsewhere on the web regarding this.

Anyway so my main problem is kind of racing thoughts when I have a trigger which ends up making me angry and unable to cope. I also have a general negative outlook on life itself, that nothing is worth living for and that I‚Äôve got purpose in life.

Adding onto that I also have severe social anxiety which stops me speaking to anyone I‚Äôm not extremely close to.

So I‚Äôm thinking Xanax seems like it might help hugely with the racing thoughts part, and I was also looking at Adderall for general mood.

Now, that is not to say that I have zero interest in art in a sober state, but I think it‚Äôs fair to say that drugs just takes it all to another level.

I think a part of me has, because of my past drug-fueled trips and what not, deduced that I‚Äôm such and such a person who is creative and that I‚Äôm probably passionate about arts. So therefore the past few years I have been plucking my guitar, writing, and done numerous other activities. 

Problem is, it doesn‚Äôt really feel like I‚Äôm that passionate about arts when I am sober. I‚Äôd say a large part of my normal day to day life consists of distracting myself from boredom. And yes, I pickup my guitar every once in a while, but it seems to be more of a means of avoiding being bored, than an urge to actually play guitar. 

Have I been misled by drugs into thinking that I am passionate about things I‚Äôm really not that passionate about? 
Or is this just a normal thing, and perhaps the reason why so many artists, writers, etc. use alot of drugs?

I‚Äôve experienced some bad/scary moments on a trip when things get a little intense, but never had a bad trip in its entirety. Until yesterday :/

I‚Äôve been struggling with an eating disorder for the past 6 months and decided to try tripping by myself for the first time in a few years (my first ever acid trip was by myself and I loved it). I hoped it would bring me some self acceptance and allow me to reflect on why I feel the need to treat my body so poorly and starve myself, and I thought I would at least come out of the trip with a bit more self love and acceptance. 

But instead my eating disorder completely overpowered the acid (and the quality of the acid was amazing) and caused me to have the absolute worst body dysmorphia for 12 hours straight. It genuinely made me feel like I was 10 pounds heavier all day, and gave me the worst munchies I‚Äôve ever had (I normally don‚Äôt like eating on acid). I had a huge binge, and ended up making myself throw up 3 separate times because I couldn‚Äôt stand the feeling of being so full. Even when I knew I had gotten everything out of my stomach, the acid was still making me feel weird in general and I was just convinced I looked bloated and gross all day. And let me tell you, intentionally making yourself puke in the bathroom while you‚Äôre also tripping on acid and trying to have a good time is just a terrible idea. And then looking in the mirror post-puke and seeing yourself tripping... ugh

So I now know to definitely hold off on the acid until my mental health is significantly better. I definitely didn‚Äôt get the experience I wanted from this trip, but the one thing I did gain was a huge eye opener as to how much I‚Äôve really been struggling, because the fact that this mentality has ruined an experience from a drug that I normally LOVE and have such good memories from is so disheartening. 

People aren‚Äôt joking when they say you need to be in a good headspace to be on acid.

Well, the past couple of days I haven't been using it, simply because I haven't needed it, and I may aswell take a break to reset tolerance ect.

Well, today I woke up ad knew I had some stuff to get done, so I thought I'd dose some 2fma.

I have dissolved my 2fma in a glass of water in my refrigerator, so I can just take a sip whenever I need to.

So I took a sip from the glass this morning, I'm not sure how much but judging from the effects it was probably 50mg. I also had a strong coffee and some L-theanine a few hours later. 

After that, I sat down and compromised a list of stuff I wanted to get done that day. 

Well let me tell you, I got all the tasks done, and proceeded to finish even more productive tasks that I hadn't even originally planned. 

Only downsides:
- Minor headache on the ""comedown"", likely due to a bit of dehydration. Fixed easily with 2 paracetamol tablets and a large glass of water. 
- Was slightly irritable and slightly anxious on the comeup. I definitely had a bit too much. I noticed I was irritable though, and was mindful of it, so I knew not to react upon it, and 2 hours later it went away. 

But yeah man. Got so much shit done:
- Cleaned and tidied my whole apartment. Cleaned the dishes, went out with the trash, hung washing up to dry ect. 
- Went to the mechanic with my car.
- Went to the gym and had a nice workout.
- Took all my vitamins and minerals. 
- Called up [*company*] to ask for a cancellation-refund for some flight tickets. 
- Transferred some credit left over in an abroad account to my home bank account. 
- Calculated how much money that I owed my girlfriend, and payed it. 
- Ate really healthy and stuck to my diet. 
- Emptied my luggage case full of clothes from a holiday and sorted it into the right drawers and put miscellaneous items in their correct places ect. 
- Filled fuel on the car, and went to the scrap with some stuff that had been piling up. 
- Made a shopping list for tomorrow. 
- Had a long shower, and a shave, and straightened my hair, trimmed my nails and exfoliated my face. 
- Listened to great music. 

So yeah. I did take a bit too much but when I noticed I was slightly anxious and irritable, I thought I might aswell put all that energy to good use, otherwise it would only continue to be converted to jittery anxious irritability.
Had a fantastic day. Love this chemical. So clean, great with 20-30mg in the morning on empty stomach, followed by a cup of coffee 4 hours later and L-theanine throughout the day to ease the jitteryness as needed.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,694136,public,confidence,self,"2fma is so freaking phenomenal, holy shit.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hschkx/2fma_is_so_freaking_phenomenal_holy_shit/,no_ads,0.0,1594944999.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A small banner appears at the top, once clicked it says that to gain full access to your banking services you must verify your account via a State-issued photo ID. Once that‚Äôs uploaded and passes verification you have access to your account, but there‚Äôs another banner, connect your credit/debit card or bank account to add funds. In the small print it states that you must add funds to your account this way before you can apply for your promised free debit card, plus the account is useless if you don‚Äôt add your card or bank because your money will be stuck as you have no way to transfer nor spend it. Once funds have been added to your account you are ready to open for business, and with the high transfer limits the world‚Äôs your oyster.""

Apart from it's opioid effects, it also has SSRI and SNRI properties to it, withdrawals on this are baaadddd and apparently one of it's metabolite, desmetramadol, will bind to the opioid receptors much more strongly.

Last night I got some weed from one of my friend‚Äôs dealers. I‚Äôve smoked weed a couple of times before and always felt very relaxed and happy. Except last time, when I used the same sort of weed and had a small trip.

Last night I had about a quarter of a normalish joint and things start to go really weird. Now this looked like weed, having broken down the bus myself. But it has a really minty smell and doesn‚Äôt really smell too bad. The whole experience lasted only about 4 hours, after which I felt very sober.

 I was with a girl with who I have a really intense short termish thing and we‚Äôre in a park.

All of a sudden I‚Äôm miles away, within 5 minutes. I‚Äôve gone way past the giggles and the numbness and I‚Äôm just away.

Everything is so slow and I‚Äôm moving weirdly. It almost feels like I‚Äôm in a hyper realist lucid dream but nothing is real and all the people around me are projections of my subconscious. There‚Äôs a very heavy sensation where my body makes contact with things and I can‚Äôt feel anything else. Except this strong heavy mass of energy in my chest, as if my lower body is connected to an astral form in my upper body.

After getting back to the hotel with her we just spend the whole night talking and things go really dark. She starts to get really insecure about our situation and I‚Äôm scared because I don‚Äôt know what to do, both then and in general.

And eventually I‚Äôm delving deep within myself. And I‚Äôm really freaking out because there‚Äôs nothing. Like I can‚Äôt ever be fulfilled or something. I‚Äôm fully lost in my quest for life and perfection and there‚Äôs nothing left for me here. Like nothing means anything and I can‚Äôt ever find happiness?

The visual slow experience is mostly over. And I‚Äôm just starting to see things inside my head. I can visualise anything and it instantly fills me.

Eventually Breathe by Pink Floyd comes on, the bad times end and the experience is over.

Is this normal??
Was the weed laced with something perhaps?

im not telling you to do it or that you should. im just saying that if you do it, you should do it smart. 

if youre in a situation to where you cant smoke weed or youre underage. then definitely dont smoke weed. BUT if you INSIST, these are some good ways to do it and not get caught. 

My first tip is to always do it outside. Not only will the smell get lost quick because of the open air and wind, but its easier to find a place to not get caught. If you arent allowed to randomly go outside, then try sneaking out. although, if you arent 100% sure that you can sneak out successfully, then dont do it. Also, if you act stupid while youre high, then make sure to smoke at a time when youre sure that you wont have to interact with anyone for the next 2-4 hours. We will talk more about this later. 

Things to do no matter what-
I always recommend eating or drinking something when youre done to cover your breath. you can chew gum too if thats more your speed. Always wash your hands. And if youd like, dab some stick deodorant on your neck. i find that perfume or cologne is a bit too much. If you still think you can smell it on you, clean your nostrils out with some toilet paper. the smoke might have just caught in your nose and you might be biased. 

Smoking indoors - if you are 100% sure that you wont be able to smoke outside, then the best case scenario is to wait until everyone is asleep. I would recommend getting a smokebuddy (which is a filter that you can blow the smoke through after you take a hit to minimize the smell) but if you cant access one then here is a guide on how to make one out of household ingredients.

if you can, like a candle or some incense in your room before you start smoking. keep it lit while youre smoking and for at least 10 minutes after. I recommend opening a window and then smoking out of it, while inhaling into the smokebuddy. you can never be too safe. follow all of the previously stated tips for when youre finished and then you should be good. 

Smoking outdoors - this is my favorite way. you dont have to worry anywhere near as much if youre smoking outdoors. just smoke your weed, brush your shirt off and brush through your hair with your hands a few times (smell will stick bad on your hair and clothes) and then sit outside for 10-20 minutes. Nothing gets rid of that smell like the wind. When youre ready to go inside, follow the tips at the top and then youre good. 

Now that we‚Äôve pretty much covered the smell (probably the most important part, in my opinion) Ill talk about the next most important thing. how you act.

Mastering your high - If you already know you can act normal around people while high, then you shouldnt be worried about this. if you know that you get stupid after you smoke, then my advice is to just go to your room and chill until youre less high. If anyone asks about you, then just say you dont feel good or whatever. If you‚Äôre absolutely forced into interacting with people, then dont get too paranoid. just try not to talk to much and dont let your mind get the best of you. act how you normally act. Most importantly, as stated way above, just try to schedule beforehand. try to smoke when you know you dont have anything to do for a while, Or while everyones asleep. 

Eyes - this is something ive never been very concerned about because you can just randomly have bloodshoot eyes but if you‚Äôre genuinely worried about it, then (obviously) try to get eyedrops. unlike the smokebuddy, you wont have to go to a smokeshop or order this offline. anyone of any age can buy eyedrops. you can buy them pretty much at any store (walmart, dollar tree, target, walgreens, etc.) for under 5 dollars. if you somehow cant get 5 dollars or cant get to store or whatever, then my advice is to just stay hydrated. drink a lot of water. If your eyes are red no matter what, then just try not to worry too much. if you dont smell of weed, and you aren‚Äôt acting unusual, then you should be fine. 

Other- here are some other tips ive picked up throughout time for varying situations that may or may not happen. 

Nothing to smoke out of - (i dont reccomend this advice. its a last resort and i an not condoning it) 
if you can roll, then roll a receipt joint. if you cant, then make a pipe out of a can. (this one is probably not good for you at all long term. again, last resort) all you need is a soda pop can and a tack or a knife or something like that. here is a tutorial

https://youtu.be/kmoiNaQrdxU

Nothing to light it with - Ive never personally had this problem, as i have always had access to a lighter, but apparently you can put an uncooked spaghetti stick on a hot stovetop and it works as a match of some sorts. for this one, If its really an issue, i recommend using google. 

You have nothing to cover up the smell - this one is for outside explicitly. if youre smoking outside and cant go inside without running into people, then as soon as youre done smoking, rip up some fresh grass from the ground, and start breaking it up with your hands. it will mask the smell on your hands pretty good. after that, brush your hair and shirt off, and then swish your tongue around and swallow all of your spit. do this as many times as youd like (id say a minimum of 5 times) after this, sit outside for at least 10 to 15 minutes.

this has been my guide. maybe it sounds too paranoid to you all, but some people cant get enough weed. and some of those people, just so happen to be people who cant afford to be caught. Again, if youre underage, definitely dont smoke. but if you insist, this is the way to go.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,694124,public,confidence,self,my guide to smoking weed for people who cant afford to be caught.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hs8869/my_guide_to_smoking_weed_for_people_who_cant/,no_ads,0.0,1594929102.0,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'uLMSgHqmkovcBkiiAJmIAkCl-xSgTG53UTbGmQedzsc', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Uh9X-XeC-5XCgLFU_a-sIIkpQq_nmXeXL-zw-dz97CA.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c17fa0aa2efa851147b09267de3ddc5b3212eb1', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Uh9X-XeC-5XCgLFU_a-sIIkpQq_nmXeXL-zw-dz97CA.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5783b8d1452f3b74f1c16cfa8aeb0987f15698c3', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Uh9X-XeC-5XCgLFU_a-sIIkpQq_nmXeXL-zw-dz97CA.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7edb495f420e6a69b686ecbe7aa99dd468b37562', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/Uh9X-XeC-5XCgLFU_a-sIIkpQq_nmXeXL-zw-dz97CA.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=691da825893f480329afbaa3c3ef5686f87245a0', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I get it. Kids are annoying. Nobody is interested in an arrogant 14 year old preaching about how high they got from a joint or where they should hide it so that their mom won't find it. These posts are clearly annoying so they should be discouraged and downvoted. Someone should explain to them how this sub works and what it is for. The irritation that these posts cause is wholeheartedly justified in my opinion. I don't take issue with the posts complaining about them at all. 

For me, the danger occurs when I see Top posts saying that they don't think kids should be allowed at all and getting angry that they ask ignorant questions. For instance, ""acid fried my brain"" posts can be annoying when its clear that no, acid did not, in fact, fry their brain. But bad trips can be a real source of anxiety - kids also have these genuine experiences. Compounding the problem is the fact that they probably don't have many people they can talk to about it, so they turn to the internet. Yes, their panic often translates as ignorant and their anxiety as refusing to listen to the smart words of someone more experienced. But those are natural ways of dealing with something scary - yes they can be annoying but its vital that people more experienced are patient with them. 

If a kid is gonna ask if he'll get addicted after he takes triple the amount of adderall he's prescribed every day for months on end, it's important that someone tells him that he could well. Yes, they might come across as naive when they say that they don't have an addictive personality or that he's not the type to get addicted. But those kinds of justifications are part of the problem that they no-doubt have. They need to be told that patiently

It's undoubtedly a bad idea for a teenager to experiment with coke, amphetamines, or opioids. Yes, it's pretty clear that no 14 year old should have to teeter on the edge of addiction while their peers are more concerned over how to ask out their crush and whether or not people will notice their voice cracking. But many do. And because they're kids they're gonna ask stupid questions and be arrogant. But, for this sub to truly be dedicated to harm reduction, there has to be a place for them. 

Without going too into it, lurking in this sub has helped and continues to help me at least try to use responsibly - at an age where very few do.

What do you think about Denver‚Äôs shroom law? Have you had any bad experiences with lsd or shrooms? Do any of you have PTSD from it?

Here is my story of how it gave me PTSD (sorry so long): 
I actually grew up in Denver and it was not legal while I grew up. But growing up here I feel like kids are very ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs nothing it‚Äôs just a drug it‚Äôs harmless like weed.‚Äù And it‚Äôs hard to really be able to tell that it is anything wildly different from alcohol or other drugs because it is so common. And of course when I was like 18 I was an idiot and had no Idea what I was doing I just did what friends did. I never heard any bad experiences from it.

I ended up doing lsd one time with a friend and ran away from him and was like screaming on the street. I thought I was in hell and I just wanted to get out and I wanted life to just stop. I had to be hospitalized, mom had to pick me up she thought I was crazy. I literally decided to DO IT AGAIN because I was fucking ridiculous and read online the only way to stop the weird feeling I had after I tripped  (it was probably like 2 months later) was to do it again. Literally the same thing happened just different friends.

My mom made me go to a rehab at the time. I wasn‚Äôt even like an addict or someone who is always abusing crazy drugs all the time or anything. It just felt like everyone I knew did this why wouldn‚Äôt I try it? But It permanently damaged me!

Now 5 years later to this day I literally still have PTSD! It is not as severe and I can go about my daily life. But I am very scared of weird situations I couldn‚Äôt even explain to you that is normal for people. I usually fear someone is out to get me. Or all the people I know are fake. I don‚Äôt believe I have schizophrenia as there is still a part of me that knows this is due to the trip and it also seems to get better with time. 

It is not something that puts a hold to my life but It is pretty annoying always believing your life may be fake. Or there is some weird thing going on that has to do with that trip and eventually I will find out everything is fake. I think what I can not let go of is the feeling I had when I was on acid and ‚Äúrealized the world was not real.‚Äù I permanently fear that feeling because it was the most traumatic thing I ever felt and I am permanently scared I will feel it again. I am kinda permanently scared something in my life will happen and I am going to have that feeling again of realizing the world is fake and not know how to leave the fake world or something? If that can make any sense lol sorry!

It is also annoying that you can‚Äôt just talk to your therapist about that!!! How could they even help you? I literally saw my boyfriend die 2 years ago (he was an adrenaline junkie) and the PTSD of acid is literally WORSE than my ptsd of seeing him die! Sorry I don‚Äôt want to get like dark I‚Äôm okay but isn‚Äôt that crazy?

I did actually try mushrooms (with the boyfriend!) and it was really nice. But probably because I was older and not fucking 18 and crazy. I have seen posts on here saying shrooms gave them ptsd. Ugh

I just want to see peoples thoughts. Maybe someone has similar stories because they really intrigue me since like I said this now has some weird meaning for me I can not get rid of. I feel like when I tell people this, a lot of people just say no it‚Äôs great and you just did it at the wrong time. I understand it‚Äôs really nice for some people. I just wish someone told me at the time how intense it was. I probably still would of done it though :( It is so crazy to me that something that totally altered my train of thought is legal. And that I do not hear about more people with bad experiences that gave them permanent PTSD. It‚Äôs super crazy looking it up and seeing how it treats people for ptsd! I am sure it does but I just had the opposite experience.

ive seen people saying theyve done mdma 3-4 times a day for a year straight and are completely fine and all they said was stay hydrated/get sleep every night. but ive also seen people saying you should wait a week all the way up to a month till u roll again. does anyone know how often i can actually roll without like fucking up my brain or depression really bad?and how fast does the tolerance start going up?
i hope im not speaking hieroglyphics and this makes sense to sm1

edit: ive only done molly 3 times now, first 2 times was like the very energetic comeup and then on the come down did some xans, went to sleep and felt so damn normal the next day. and those rolls were separated by like a week or 2, and recently i did this shit called mdmc thats one molecule off mdma and its a less intense roll but ur still talkative, lovey dovey, fucking rolling,feeling so damn good, but it lasts longer like an addy high and its smooth like a addy high, im never tweaking or anything on it.
but i didnt take xans on that one and stayed up for like 40 hours but havent really felt depressed just every once n a while im fiending like its coke. which caused a very very mild depression/anxiety for like only 10 seconds and then it goes away.

Here are just a few resouces to use to help you know more about the substance you want to know about, if it is just for educational purposes or if you are about to consume a chemical. The websites show estimated dosages for (Light,medium,heavy etc) and alot of other important things to know

I see too many people come here and ask advice, sure there are alot of good answers, but alot of opinionated ones too. 

Chemicals are a beautiful thing and i mean it should be used, but with respect! So please anyone out there before you are about to eat 15 post stamps because ""xxxdmtgodxxx"" said it was a normal dose, please do your own research :)

After taking a couple mg‚Äôs of clon I get the bright idea to buy some pressed pink 10‚Äôs off a plug cuz fuck it I wanna get stupid high. No need to tell me how stupid mixing incredibly potent benzos and fent is, I was being moronic. Anyway, plug slides in a whip, hand him the money and get the pills. Everything on benzos kinda happens on auto pilot so the slap goes by quick and I hop out the car.

Walking back to my house I start checking my pockets going oh fuck. The pill baggie is nowhere to be found. 
‚ÄúFuck‚Äù I‚Äôm panicking a little wondering how the hell I just lost the percs so fast. I‚Äôm spam texting my plug asking him if they in the car and looking for them on the street like an idiot. I mean I got a phone flashlight out at 1am on the street looking under cars and the road for anything. A cop car even passes me by probably wondering what in God‚Äôs name I was doing but off the benzos I was unfazed and continued my search.

Eventually after legit half an hour of looking I give up and concede to go to the projects to the plug himself and get more 10‚Äôs since fuck it now I definitely need to get high since I just wasted money. I get right to the entrance of the housing project when my fucking phone dies just as I send my plug the ‚Äúhere‚Äù text. 

Determined to get my shit I start wondering around the projects at 1:30am, people playing dice, drinking, all staring wondering what the hell is this white boy doing here besides obviously trying to cop drugs. Eventually in my complete retard benzo confidence I approach some random black guy and ask him if he knows where ‚Äúplugname‚Äù is. He looks at me confused saying nah but asks me what I‚Äôm tryna cop. Just as I start telling him yerkies and tryna think of a way to exit this conversation I hear a familiar ‚ÄúYo‚Äù and see my plug thankfully walking toward me.

Get another 3 pink 10‚Äôs and proceed to get the fuck outta hood. Make it home and now I‚Äôm finally ready to get high. I remember I have some coke in my sock so I go to grab and low and behold my fucking pill baggie I thought I lost earlier is there.

So for a while now I (21 F) have always been the go to comfort person, on a night out whether it be a group MDMA session, or another funny night (no psychoactive substance). This is bc on most of the drugs we take, I am usually the most level headed person to go to (somehow, but apparently so). I don't have a problem with that and am okay, I understand I calm them down well, even with new friends first time taking anything. However, because of this, one of my close friends (23 M) is planing on taking some shrooms this weekend and has asked me to be his trip sitter for his first time taking mushrooms.  


I am happy to do it and look forward to going through this with him. However, he has a lot of past trauma and I am unsure of what could come up (or how to deal with it on a trip). Im just wondering if there are any experienced trippers that could give me a good idea on how to look after him best, and any advice! I have personally never taken shrooms, so know I'm un-equipped fully for this, but im the only person he wants involved in his trip as we are very good friends. Any advice would be very helpful!

I've researched drugs a bit, I have some in mind that I would like to experiment with in the future, hell if I could now, I would, but the thing is I don't really no anyone, I don't socialize, I don't go to parties, I don't leave my house. I've tried therapy, only for a few sessions (I refused to continue with it after because I felt uncomfortable and it wasn't really helping) because my parents think something's wrong with me, even tho they've literally beat me my whole life. I've landed in the ER because of my brother w a major head bleed before, so if that doesn't sum it up, idk what does. So, yeah I have depression, or at least I think (I'm getting an appointment to take the screening soon to actually get a diagnosis, but for the most part, I know I have depression and anxiety) because I've cried every night for so long, I can't exactly remember how long, it's been years and years, I mean ik I've been unhappy my whole life because up until 6th grade, I had toxic friends that used me as a subject to make fun of, bullied me, and overall just didn't respect me the way they did others and then after 6th grade, I had none at all, no friends whatsoever, not even the toxic ones. Anyways, I'm getting off topic here. To someone with such low self esteem about themselves, low pretty much everything, to someone that's been at an all time low they're whole life, drugs are a pretty appealing thing. Who doesn't like the idea of all of their pain being taken away, pure bliss, pure euphoria, just happiness, happiness that they've been deprived of their whole life due to the cards that they've been dealt. So, I'm kind of a pussy and I know I could never go overboard (even though I almost attempted suicide by stealing my mom's old medication) and overdose or anything just because I'd be too scared, hell I'd probably take too less instead of too much and not even feel anything, but I guess the problem here is that I don't know anyone that deals drugs and I don't think I could find anyone, I live in a pretty nice community/area so I'm sure there's people, but not many, and I wouldn't know how or where to start looking. All I've ever done is vape THC carts and that started only this/last month too. Moreover I feel like it's pointless, those experiences, the euphoria you get from drugs, it's meant to be spent with people that you care about and that care about you. Those experiences are meant to shared with friends that you'd have the time of your life with and I don't have anyone. I feel like people are gonna say you have your whole life to figure it out, to do all these things, there's no rush to start at such a young age, but what am I supposed to do? I want to, not because drugs are ""cool"" or because other people are doing it, I know that they're damaging, do you think I want brain damage? I just want to be happy. And if getting high can make you happy? If it can make you have the time of your life, experiences you've never had before, then of course I'd want to try. I just...I don't know...It's all confusing...and I don't know where to start. I feel like I'm wasting my life away, being so young and in high school, you'd think you'd have friends, you'd think you'd have people by your side, people by your side to have fun with and do crazy and wild shit with, but in reality you're just completely and entirely alone, like you always have been, there's no one else there but you. I don't know, I guess I'm here for advice, for advice on how to get my hands on different drugs, how to start experimenting, how to do it in groups of people, how to go to parties, how to just do things I guess, like I haven't even had alcohol yet, so clearly I'm not very experienced with this shit. I haven't left my house in three months, and even before that, the only time I ever left my house was for school.

I didn‚Äôt feel like this when I was younger, but now it hurts my heart to cry. Of course there are people who feel the same way I do, but nobody I know. I just isolate myself because I‚Äôm tired of embarrassing myself. I like being sober, but it‚Äôs just boring right?  I‚Äôm too young to be smoking weed everyday too. At least that is what I am sticking to now. Only beers now too. I am fine now but it saddens me to think of what I did in a year. Scared I‚Äôve fucked myself, but maybe it‚Äôs in my head.

I think drugs are amazing, they can enhance your life and allow you to experience things you otherwise wouldn't ever be able to, however they can also consume your life, take it over, and bring you to a point where you believe that without them, you are nothing, that they are all you have in life to be happy. I want to help people use drugs to enhance their lives, to have fun, but to be safe while doing it, so I want to start a series on harm reduction as I've spent a ton of time studying how to best reduce harm with drugs, and I want to share the knowledge I have.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I start with this first post I want to preface it by saying, I'M NOT A MEDICAL EXPERT. Everything I have learned has been through reading posts here, on erowid, bluelight, ect. I always try and double check things, find sources when I can, ect, however this is in no way medical advise. It is simply the rules I follow and the understanding I have of these substances. If I say something wrong, please, by all means, correct me, and as soon as I see it, and with research agree that I am wrong, I will add a disclaimer that I have made a mistake and correct that mistake in my actual post.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the first drug I want to cover, as it is one I have spent a bunch of time researching harm reduction for, the one and only  Nitrous Oxide / Laughing Gas / Whip Its ect!

&amp;#x200B;

I have split this up into 4 parts, skip through them as you see fit, although I think this post is the most useful if you read everything! It did turn out super long though so if you don't want to read a bunch of stuff you can just check out what you are interested in!

# Part 1: Myths about nitrous

&amp;#x200B;

**The Main Myth about Nitrous:** All inhalants are bad and incredibly dangerous, and will give you brain damage.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Truth from my understanding:** For a myth, this actually isn't all that bad of one, as in the whole scheme of things, this probably keeps more people safe than not, however it just isn't true. I'm a firm believer that drugs aren't evil, that we can't just consider a chemical bad, and that we can't say anyone that uses a chemical is bad, or that they are doing something wrong. That is, beside inhalants. The majority of inhalants are absolutely terrible, will cause brain damage, and  you risk instant death through sudden stiffing death syndrome (SSDS). This is because the majority of inhalants get you high through the inhalation of volatile chemicals, which while they do carry some psychoactive components, are, as erowid and many other websites say ""***inseparable from nerve and organ damage*****"".** What these substances do, is damage the myelin sheath of a neuron, which surrounds the axons of a cell, protecting it, and allowing it to transmit messages quicker. This means that most inhalants really do lead to brain damage, and kill cells in a way, which we hear so often about drugs but is so often untrue. There are however 3 main inhalants from my understanding, that are much safer, and while they pose their own risks and must still be used with harm reduction in mind, these are Nitrous Oxide, Amyl Nitrate (and other nitrates) and  Diethyl ether.

&amp;#x200B;

Nitrous Oxide specifically has been used medically for a very long time, and you may have even used it before at the dentist in the form of laughing gas. It still has risk of causing brain damage in two ways which I will get into later, however with proper harm reduction techniques these can be avoided.

&amp;#x200B;

**Myth 2:** Nitrous gets you high through displacing oxygen in the brain and thus it gets you high through hypoxia.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Truth:** While we don't have a full understanding of the mechanism of action of nitrous oxide we know it works similarly to several drugs many people use. It is hypothesized that it may act on  NMDA glutamate receptors, GABA receptors, as well as working similarly to opiates in some ways. Here are two parts of a medical paper discussing nitrous that give some perspective on it, the paper will be linked after the quotes.

&amp;#x200B;

*Advances in Understanding the Actions of Nitrous Oxide by Dimitris E Emmanouil*

***Abstract:***

""*Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been used for well over 150 years in clinical dentistry for its analgesic and anxiolytic properties. This small and simple inorganic chemical molecule has indisputable effects of analgesia, anxiolysis, and anesthesia that are of great clinical interest. Recent studies have helped to clarify the analgesic mechanisms of N2O, but the mechanisms involved in its anxiolytic and anesthetic actions remain less clear. Findings to date indicate that the analgesic effect of N2O is opioid in nature, and, like morphine, may involve a myriad of neuromodulators in the spinal cord. The anxiolytic effect of N2O, on the other hand, resembles that of benzodiazepines and may be initiated at selected subunits of the Œ≥-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor. Similarly, the anesthetic effect of N2O may involve actions at GABAA receptors and possibly at N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors as well.*""

&amp;#x200B;

***Summary:***

*""* *It is apparent from the above discussion that N2O has multiple mechanisms of action that underlie its varied pharmacological properties. Current research indicates that the analgesic effect of N2O appears to be initiated by stimulated neuronal release of endogenous opioid peptides, with subsequent activation of opioid receptors and descending GABA and noradrenergic pathways that modulate nociceptive processing at the spinal level. The anxiolytic effect of N2O involves activation of the GABAA receptor through the benzodiazepine binding site, although whether N2O acts directly or indirectly upon the latter targets remains uncertain. The anxiolytic pathway that is stimulated includes a segment that involves a sequence of 3 key enzymes, NOS, soluble guanylyl cyclase, and PKG. The anesthetic effect of N2O appears to be caused by inhibition of NMDA glutamate receptors and removing its excitatory influence in the nervous system.*""

# Part 2: Harm Reduction - Things to know and techniques

First off, wow, I made that first part way longer than I intended. I thought this would be a shorter thing but I want to give as much knowledge and stop as much misinformation as possible so I prefer to write as much as needed. I hope it isn't too long where people don't end up reading it. I'll try and cut it down in future ones if you guys think this is too long, but you can always skip to the different parts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Harm Reduction 1)** One of the most dangerous parts of the way people use nitrous most of the time is the fact that it is coming from a cartridge which when released using a whip cream dispenser or cracker are extremely cold. While it is super hard to use whip its directly from a cracker, it isn't so hard to do it from the whip cream dispensers, however this can be very dangerous and I believe in some cases even deadly. Because the gas is so cold it can freeze the lips and throat, and in some cases I believe even cause damage to the lungs or lead to them collapsing. This can be super dangerous and absolutely no fun to deal with so lets avoid it!

**Solution 1)** The solution to this problem is very simple and you probably all already know it as this is the biggest harm reduction advise people give out, USE A BALLOON. Simply attach the the balloon to the end of the cracker, which is what they are designed for, or slip it over the end of the whip cream dispenser. Then empty the container into the balloon and give it a few seconds to cool off.

&amp;#x200B;

**Harm Reduction 2)** I said earlier that whip its did not get you high through the loss of oxygen to the brain or through hypoxia, HOWEVER, if not taken with the proper harm reduction this can still cause the brain to lack oxygen. This is because the way the body sends you a response to needing air in a very strange way, instead of checking the levels of oxygen in your blood, and when that is too low saying heyyyyyy you gotta breath bro, it does something different.  It checks the levels of CO2 in your blood, and when those get too high your body is like yo gotta breath. Here is the big problem, nitrous ""*removes carbon dioxide from the blood without replacing it with oxygen will produce no outward signs of suffocation even when the brain is experiencing hypoxia*"" (Psychonaught wiki). This means that if you take a bunch of whip its in a row, without breathing, your body won't tell you that you are lacking oxygen, suffocating, and possibly causing damage to the brain and body, but it is still happening. This is even more dangerous when people use full medical tanks, as if the gas is not mixed with oxygen and a mask is used, you may pass out, and there won't be any way for you to get oxygen.

**Solution 2)** This is most important when you are taking several whip its in a row, however I always try and follow the same process every time I do them to keep the habit good, and make sure I am being safe. Fill your balloon with nitrous, and breath in and out of it for a couple of breaths, I like to wait until I get it to about half full, and get like 2 or 3 breaths, then exhale what is left in your lungs outside of the balloon, and take at least 3 deep breaths in and out before going back to the balloon and finishing what is left. Before you do your next balloon take at least 3 more deep breaths, preferably more, to make sure your getting enough oxygen \[**Im gonna be honest, and I'd love it if someone can tell me or correct me, I don't actually know how effective or safe the aspect of breathing in and out of the balloon is. From my understanding if you just take a breath in and then exhale it some of it may be wasted however a lot of the stuff you breath back out is CO2 anyways, and that isn't gonna get you high, so if someone knows if all of the nitrous is absorbed within the first few seconds, so there is no need to do this technique, much like how there is no reason to hold in weed hits, or if this is effective, or maybe its dangerous and i'm giving out bad advise, please let me know\].**

Along with this, NEVER use any system which will administer nitrous continuously such as a mask or something like that. As fun as it may be, please, leave it to the professionals for that kind of thing where they can control how much nitrous and oxygen you are getting.

&amp;#x200B;

**Harm Reduction 3)** I said that there are two ways which nitrous can cause brain and nerve damage, the first being through lack of oxygen, and the second being the scariest in my opinion, vitamin b12 deficiency. When I first used whip its, and did not do proper harm reduction, me and my best friend binged on these for days, I always say it was like 2 weeks in a row, I don't know if that was really the case, but there was quite a period where we would buy at least 24 most of the time 50 boxes of these things and use them daily. I still knew some harm reduction and knew the risks of Vitb12 deficiency, but we didn't understand it fully so I will try and explain. Long story short, one day my best friend called me and said she woke up with her hands and feet going numb, this is one of the biggest signs of the deficiency. We stopped using right away, and since then we barely use whip its anymore, just a box every few months or something. Now that was a bit of a side track but let me explain how VB12D (Vitamin B12 Deficiency) works, symptoms, and risks. The huge risk with VB12D is that 

""*A lack of B12 damages the myelin sheath that surrounds and protect nerves. Without this protection, nerves cease to function properly and conditions such as peripheral neuropathy occur. Even B12 deficiency that is relatively mild may affect the nervous system and the proper functioning of the brain.*"" ( [https://www.foundationforpn.org/what-is-peripheral-neuropathy/causes/vitamin-nutrition-deficiency/#:\~:text=A%20lack%20of%20B12%20damages,proper%20functioning%20of%20the%20brain.](https://www.foundationforpn.org/what-is-peripheral-neuropathy/causes/vitamin-nutrition-deficiency/#:~:text=A%20lack%20of%20B12%20damages,proper%20functioning%20of%20the%20brain.))

**Solution 3)** This means that VB12D can cause real brain and nerve damage, and much like other inhalants, this is super dangerous and can cause lasting damage. Here are some of the symptoms of VB12D, if you experience any of these stop any drugs you are using, and I will explain how to avoid it in the future, and what to do from here:

&amp;#x200B;

* Lack of coordination
* Pain, numbness, and tingling in hands or feet
* Sensory loss
* Weakness

If you are experiencing VB12D you need to stop taking what you are taking, and start supplementing with VITB12 supplements, Prefereably mutli vitamins as well, and if possible get IV VITB12 as like I mentioned it can be super dangerous. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I want to explain how the depletion of VITB12 from nitrous oxide works, and how to avoid it. Nitrous makes the vitamin b12 in your blood stream inactive, which means it can't do its job and thus leads to this deficiency. It also makes it super difficult for your body to absorb vitamin b12, this means even if you are supplementing VitB12 as you take your whipits, because you are consuming nitrous, your body is unable to actually use them and it isn't doing you any good. It sounds scary doesn't it, making all the VitB12 in your blood stream in active? There is a good thing though, from how I remember, only 10% of the bodies VB12 is actually in the blood stream, I believe the other 90% is in the liver, and is is circulated through the body. This means that while it is still advisable that you supplement VB12 no matter how many whip its you use, if you are just using for a day, the body will be able to replenish the VB12 in your blood stream.

&amp;#x200B;

The large risk with VB12D comes from when you are using multiple days in a row. I want to make a statement, and this is from my understanding, so again if I am wrong correct me, however from all my research this seems to be the case **IT IS NOT THE AMOUNT OF WHIP ITS YOU ARE DOING AT ONE TIME THAT IS DANGEROUS (BESIDE IF YOU ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH OXYGEN) IT IS THE FREQUENCY AT WHICH YOU DO THEM, AS IN HOW MANY DAYS IN A ROW YOU ARE USING THEM THAT IS DANGEROUS.** This is because if you use nitrous daily for like 2 weeks, as me and my friend did, your body will cycle the VB12 in the liver though out it every day, however then every day you are making more and more of it inactive. After doing it for long enough, all the VB12 in your body has cycled, and you have made it all inactive, and because you are still consuming nitrous, your body is also unable to absorb more VB12, and thus, it leads you to being deficient in a very important nutrient in the body.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you are going to use whip its, it is actually more advisable (AGAIN FROM MY UNDERSTANDING) to use a bunch in a day, and then take a break for several weeks preferably a month. When thinking about this it comes to mind that I believe I read somewhere that nitrous make it more difficult for your body to absorb VB12 for 2 weeks, I don't know how accurate that number is but I think that is what I rememeber, so supplementing won't be very effective until after 2 weeks of abstanining have gone by. Of course still supplement in this time as any VB12 you can get to your body is good, and again I don't actually know where I read that or how accurate it is, but the rest about how it depletes VB12 should be.

&amp;#x200B;

**Harm Reduction 4)** Nitrous makes you dizzy, light headed, and can cause you to pass out, which can lead to you hitting your head or body on something as you consume them.

**Solution 4)** When taking nitrous avoid standing up, instead either lay down or sit on a couch or against something so you can't fall down, or if you somehow manage to fall off a chair, you have a lot less distance to fall than if you are standing. Sitting against something low to the ground or on a couch where you can't fall off easily the most advisable.

&amp;#x200B;

**Harm Reduction 5)** Black Oily residue left by whip cream chargers. Here is one that a lot of people don't seem to know about however Erowid has made an amazing post testing how this works and found a great solution. When cracking whip its from a canister, and from their testing no matter what the brand, a black oily residue, sometimes even including metal shards, can come out with the gas. We don't know what this is, or why it is from my understanding, and while I can't say it is going to be bad for you, I sure don't want to be inhaling black oil and metal shards, and I am pretty sure it can't be good for you so it may as well be avoided. I'm going to go over their soultion however I high suggest reading the entire post on erowid as it is very informative and will help you understand what I am talking about and also gives pictures as reference. 

 [https://erowid.org/chemicals/nitrous/nitrous\_article2.shtml](https://erowid.org/chemicals/nitrous/nitrous_article2.shtml)

**Solution 5)** While there has even been tool made specifically for avoiding contamination and filtering nitrous, erowid found that this tool doesn't do a very good job and only lowers the about of residue by around 10-20%, however there is actually a super easy solution. According to erowid ""*A single layer of cotton filter on the output nozzle caught around 95% of the residue and three layers caught virtually all residue. Even under magnification, no residue was visible on the fourth layer of the output filter.""* So the easiest solution here, and this is why I personally recommend avoiding crackers and just getting a whip cream dispenser, is wrapping 3 layers of cloth such as a tshirt or a kitchen towel around the output nozzle as this can catch pretty much all the contaminants, and allow you to inhale your nitrous without having to feel all dirty about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Harm Reduction 6)** What drugs to combined with nitrous and what to avoid.

**Solution 6)**

***Combined - It is important to note that nitrous oxide will almost always make whatever you are experiencing more intense. This can lead to things getting scary if you are not used to diving deep with the drug you are taking such as psychedelics or other dissociatives. Make sure you are ready for what you are going to experience. Nitrous doesn't last very long however while under the influence of other drugs the experience you are in for may feel like it lasted a whole lot longer than it really did. Also always do your own research when combining drugs are there is always more danger when taking multiple substances.*** 

Psychedelics: ""*When taken in combination with a psychedelic such as LSD or psilocybin mushrooms, the effect will be a sudden and dramatic increase in perceived geometry to its maximum level of 8A or 8B. This is alongside a sudden and dramatic ego death.""* (Psychonaught Wiki)

Other Dissociatives: ""*When taken in combination with a dissociative such as MXE or DXM, the effect will be a sudden and dramatic increase in disconnective effects and the triggering of a sudden internal hallucinatory scenario.*"" (Psychonaught Wiki)

&amp;#x200B;

MDMA (Probably other empathogens too): While it is not listed or mentioned by psychonaught wiki, and I have not personally taken these two substances together, I have heard a lot good things about this combination, that it is super euphoric and can be a lot of fun! Adam from PsychedSubstance did a video on this combination so if you are interested check it out!

&amp;#x200B;

***AVOID - These are substances that it is best to avoid when planning on consuming nitrous, there is likely others worth avoiding as well, so like mentioned before, before combining any substances, do your own research, and do it at your own risk.***

***Avoid these substances as combining them with nitrous can be dangerous as ""Both substances potentiate the ataxia and sedation caused by the other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. While unconscious, vomit aspiration is a risk if not placed in the recovery position. Memory blackouts are likely."" (Psychonaught Wiki)***

* Alcohol
* GHB
* GBL
* Opioids
* Tramadol

# Part 3: A rundown, how to enjoy your nitrous oxide

This is just going to be a summary of everything said above as well as a couple of things to know to enjoy whip its more.

* **Always use a balloon to cool off your nitrous before inhaling to avoid freezing your mouth, lips, and damage to your lungs**
* **Always make sure to take deep breaths in the middle of your whip its as well as every time you finish a balloon to make sure your body is getting enough oxygen as you won't be able to tell if you aren't.**
* **Don't use nitrous oxide many days in a row. From my understanding it is better to use larger amounts at one time, and then being fully abstinent, rather than using smaller amounts every day. If you use many days in a row it can and will lead to Vitamin B12 Deficiency which can be very dangerous and can lead to nerve and brain damage. I have even read about cases where people have had permanent numbness as well as other side effects after heavily using without harm reduction for a long time (these are of course anacdotal and we do not know what else they used, their diet, genes, ect, however), KEEP HARM REDUCTION IN MIND.**
* **Make sure you are sitting or laying down somewhere low to the ground so you do not hit your head or body on anything as you enjoy your nitrous.**
* **When possible use a whip cream dispenser to crack your whip its and wrap 1 to preferably 3 layers of cloth around the output nozzle to avoid black oily residue from the chargers as well as possibly even metal shards.**
* ***Nitrous oxide does not produce cross-tolerance with other dissocatives, meaning that after the use of nitrous oxide other dissociatives will not have a reduced effect. (Psychonaught Wiki)***
* **Nitrous can be very fun in combination with other drugs however it can be dangerous too! Check the list provided above and do more research before combining any substances.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Part 4: Conclusion

Well this post is finally done! That took me FOREVER! I hope it was useful, and as I said at the start and throughout the post, if there is ANY misinformation, if you have any questions, if there is anything I should change please let me know and I will get right on doing some extra research and making sure the best information possible is provided here!

&amp;#x200B;

Please also let me know what you think of this style of post. Harm reduction is one of my favorite things to study so if you guys enjoy it I would love to make more posts like this about other drugs in the future, and as I work a lot in social media, I am also considering starting an instagram page dedicated to harm reduction if I see some interest! Just let me know what you guys think! Have an amazing day and keep using drugs safely!

I had never done any psychedelics before only uppers and weed. 
I was at my brothers house, which was a regular thing for me. We usually smoked a couple bowls on the pipe of bud and then I would go home and him and his roommate would be passed out. This night was very different.  
Although I smoked weed, I never really inhaled every hit because I had such a low tolerance and wanted to make sure I was good to drive. Well they convinced me to hit the huge glass steam-roller my brother had and packed the bowl full. I kinda had a thing for his roommate so I didn‚Äôt want to puss-out. 
I ripped tf out of it until the whole tube filled with a yellowy-green smoke. It tasted like absolute shit. I thought I was going to puke. I couldn‚Äôt stop coughing for at least 4 minutes. I ran to the bathroom thinking I was going to be sick and sat down on the toilet trying to collect myself. 
I started to panic because I realized how high I was. Then suddenly the whole bathroom was spinning so I stood up and started to walk out. I became so anxious I was scared. I made my way back to the couch and thought I would just relax. The tv was playing trippie redds newest album and the screen stayed the same throughout the whole night, which I may say only made matter worse. 
All of a sudden I couldn‚Äôt move, I couldn‚Äôt speak. Everything was going into loops. I couldn‚Äôt catch a grip on reality. Nothing felt real, my brother would pop his head into my peripheral over and over which made me think I was going to be stuck in this loop. So I realized when I moved a little I was no longer in the loop. And then all of a sudden I was flipping over backwards on the couch onto the kitchen floor. That helped until I was still on the floor. So I started spinning on my side as if I was on a turn table. My brothers roommate tried to stop me but I had no grip on reality and kept going. I accidentally kicked him and that‚Äôs when he gave up on helping me (and I no longer had a chance with him) but finally I got right up, stood there. My brother asked me what was going on and what drugs I was on. I was about to start balling and was like I think I just had a panic attack. He told me to leave so I did and I sat in the car for about 30 minutes until I thought I could make it home. 
Ever since then he claims I was on some other drugs but the only thing I did was smoke that one bowl. I don‚Äôt think I touched weed for about 3 months after that. But that experience showed me a lot about my mind and the way it works, so then I was a lot more prepared when I wanted to try psychedelics. Even though I know that was just weed it reminds me a lot of some acid trips I‚Äôve seen friends go through.

Obviously they are very different chemicals and target different receptors in the brain, but just hear me out. (This is based on experience using each alone. I studied chemistry and have taken advanced pharmacology/toxicology). 

To begin, I am not what is considered a ""junkie"" (not using it in a derogatory way). Even when I frequently used given substances I never was ""out of control"". I did them because simply put, I wanted to, for ""fun"" or whatever it be. I have a white collar job now and only *rarely* recreationally use any kinds of drugs. I never had some kind of chemical dependency for whatever reason, but I admit, tried a lot of shit.

For some reason, every time I have been high on coke it always was better than the average marijuana high? I think in society it's now more acceptable to smoke the devil's lettuce but cocaine use is still viewed as ""immoral"". If anything most Americans I know that are my age (20-30s) probably regularly use or have once regularly been a marijuana consumer. There was one point in my life where I was a regular coke user because to me coke was like marijuana, and if anything enhanced my quality of life (minus all the health risks, I mean in terms of productivity). 

For me, every time I get high off marijuana I just become extremely anxious (even when going into it with a clear mind) and get extreme dry mouth. The high just makes me paranoid and in one word to describe it, unwell. As for cocaine/meth I feel almost empowered. I feel motivated to accomplish things, I have energy, I feel like a better version of me. If I had to describe the high, it's like someone who has never taken adderall taking 40XR x 10\^5 but in a happy way.

Background info: 20/F/USA/160lbs

I am not a regular marijuana user, I do not smoke or consume any marijuana most of the time. At most I will consume ""a hit"" once every 4-6 months, so it is not something that would be in my system frequently. Anyways I was just hired and need to produce a urine sample for my new job free of any marijuana/thc. I also haven't consumed any other opiates/stimulants/barbiturates (anything but tylenol tbh) recently given my applications. The only problem is (as dumb as it sounds) I am slightly paranoid it'll show!

About 5 days ago, I consumed about a tablespoon of some lemonade flavored ""marijuana infused drink"".  I'm not sure if these are just local or more widely made, but they are absolutely non-legal/dispensary drinks (weed is legal for recreation here) that some black market type entity makes. Click [Here](https://dopewomen.wordpress.com/2017/03/30/1620-e-lit-xirs-review-on-cannabis-infused-lemonade/) for more information about what it was that I consumed. 

I sipped around a tablespoon of it, as my friend offered it since I never tried it before. I knew to be cautious and only take a very small sip because marijuana and my body don't mix well. (I also have a shit tolerance from not liking the high) Anyways like any other edibles, it hit me within 30 minutes and I was what I call ""high as shit"" not enough to ""green out"" but I absolutely had anxiety and extreme dry mouth and reminded myself this is why I do not consume marijuana. 

I'm just wondering if this is a significant enough amount to even show up in a urinalysis. I never use marijuana so I wouldn't know how much/how long it would be before my urine is clear. This may sound like a stupid question given I only consumed a tablespoon but like I said, weed is not my forte! (You could say I have another drug of choice lol) I just don't want to waste my time and do the urinalysis asap if it will show positive (and have to re-do it), whereas I have until August 10 to do it and it might not if it's been long enough. If any of you regular stoners also want to educate me on the 1/2 life of THC in the body, I would honestly just love to learn lol!

Chew still has toxic chemicals in it as well, but not even nearly as much that are in ciggaretes, and chew only damages your gums, but ciggaretes not only damage your gums more than chew, but ciggaretes also damage your throat, breathing tubes, and your lungs, and honestly, I'd rather fuck up my gums, than fuck up the most important organ in the human body. Having chew sit in your cheek is also much more comfortable, than breathing in smoke, yeah it tastes bad, but people who chew safe way more money, because cans of chew last way longer than packs of cigarettes. Also the buzzes are usually stronger with chew, and I enjoy how chew slowly kicks in, ciggaretes hit you imideatly with a buzz which can be quite uncomfortable and the buzz goes away just as fast before you know it your smoking another and another.

I watched the whole thing during my trip and found a lot of the show really cool, and weird, but the last episode had a huge impact on me.

My mum was a single mum and we had a really great relationship until she got sick. She had MS and it progressed very quickly. I gained a lot of resentment towards her as she leaned on me for a lot of support and to do household chores starting from when I was 8 and would get angry at me when I didn't know how to do things. Our relationship got worse and she ended up kicking me out when I was 12. From that moment on I decided that I wanted nothing to do with her and pushed everything to do with her to the back of my head and kind of refused to revisit any feelings to do with it. I didn't speak to her for 5 years until I came to visit her on her deathbed. She was unconscious and was about 30 minutes away from passing. I still didn't say anything when I saw her. This whole relationship took a huge toll on my mental health and I really struggled with confronting it.

Episode 8 truly was life changing for me. I spent about 4 hours crying and confronting everything I had refused to do so before. It was extremely tough and took about a month after the trip for me to feel right again and get to where I am now. I no longer have any resentment for her and am able to forgive her attempts of trying to be a good mum and be thankful for her intentions. I like to think that if she didn't pass or get sick, me and her could be friends now. Which is a huge step for me.

Last mothers day I sat down and looked through old photos of us. I wrote a letter to my mum and folded it and put it in the ocean (we threw her ashes in the ocean). She was really into egyptian culture and a tradition she taught me that was on special occasions, you put out a plate of food for someone who has passed away so their spirit can eat it. I put a piece of chocolate in the ocean too.

I am so incredibly thankful for that episode for helping me overcome the hardest thing I have ever overcome. I am so so ecstatic to see my own growth and am excited to continue growing more.

My family found me on the floor of my room seizing, called 911 and I was taken to the hospital. I then was taken to an inpatient rehab facility where I detoxed but I took none of it seriously, just wanting to get out and do more drugs.

Then he told me that he already has a girlfriend and that he didn't loved me ( he tried to explain me that it was only the drug, but i didn't quite understood). So i was close to tears xD (i was really sad). Then he tried to calm me down and asked me alot of things (we got really deep).

I also had government jobs during that time. I decided to try alternate delivery once my state (Alaska) legalized weed. I use encapsulated oil, so there‚Äôs rarely much of a smell or taste, just a lovely, pure high. I have major anxiety issues, and weed quiets them down and allows me to concentrate without going insane. I don‚Äôt use until after 3 pm to keep myself from going broke buying weed, but I like to get HIGH once the time rolls around. I prefer to be alone; I get really obsessed with outer space and death when I‚Äôm high and I don‚Äôt want anyone to think I‚Äôm weird lol.

Unlike these kinds of phases when I was a bit younger, I feel like I've had a much more healthy attitude about it though. Especially when it comes to how often I trip. I've been spacing these experiences out a bit, and it's truly amazing how much more beautiful, beneficial, and special they have become.

But in the past month or so, I've had some medical issues come up. Nothing that drastically affected my quality of life, but the type of thing that I needed to get checked because it could potentially be serious. Unfortunately, I don't have a GP and my insurance isn't covered by many of the ones available. So I went to check it out at a local urgent care center, and they couldn't figure it out or help me.

So it started eating at me, and it prevented me from tripping. I'm a bit of a hypochondriac to be honest, and while I don't think I would have a ""bad trip"" (so to speak), having this kind of thing worrying me would just be something that have been stuck in the back of my mind and kept me from having the best experience I could.

Well today I finally was able to see a specialist, and without going into many details it seems like it wasn't serious and I'm fine! Still have a couple things to figure out, but for now I feel like a weight has been lifted! I've been itching to trip for weeks now and now I feel like I can without any negative energy in my mind. Plus, this week will be three months since my last MDMA experience, so I might indulge in that in the weeks to come as well. Overall I'm just glad to have my health and I'm excited for the psychedelic experiences I have in store.

I have been sober off all mind-altering substances for over a month now. I am in an IOP for substance abuse and in sober living. They actually appointed me house manager last week, but took away the position from me today. 

So I take 2-3 UA‚Äôs a week, (1-2 for IOP and 1 for sober living) and each one has popped positive for benzos. I have not taken benzos in over a month. I was on a Valium taper for 7 days when I was in rehab, but I finished that taper over 30 days ago. What I‚Äôm testing positive for is oxazepam and temazepam. I have never heard of these benzos before; needless to say I haven‚Äôt taken these drugs. 

The weird thing is that my levels of these two drugs is steadily rising, not going down. I don‚Äôt take anything except seroquel, trileptal, Prozac, and prazosin. I don‚Äôt take any supplements or drink or eat anything that would make me test positive for these drugs. 

Do you guys have any idea on what could be going on? My living situation is soon to be in jeopardy if my levels don‚Äôt start going down.

So I have depression and social anxiety, my mum doesn't understand what its like to suffer from these so she constantly comes off as uncaring, which isn't true shes one of the most loving and caring people. As you can imagine that just makes it worse for me bc we constantly clash due to me being totally unmotivated to even get out of bed. All I want to do is lay in bed, watch anime or play games, thats it nothing else half the time i don't even bother to eat for most if not the entire day, sometimes not eating til late the next night on top of that. 
Weed is one of the only things I have that can lessen my anxiety when talking to my family (I live with uncle, mum and two little brothers(I'm 20 the others are 3 &amp; 2)). I have no idea how to actually engage in a good or even proper conversation with them. Since smoking weed again regularly I have now been able to go from getting 3/4 hours of sleep every day to getting 8/12. 
My mum is constantly trying to get me to engage with my brothers but I have no idea how to and then I start struggling to even think bc ive gone so blank on what to do. I hate myself every night bc I cant get myself to be able to socialise and be a good influence on my beithers while they grow up. All I'm showing them is how not to turn out. 

I feel completely numb on the inside, the only time I feel emotion is when I'm watching anime and for some reason I find myself just boarding crying just bc the anime got a little exciting or a twist happened. 
I feel happy and good when I'm smoking weed (I know that probably just makes it worse bc I depend on it as my only source of happiness but I okay with that for now bc I'd probably start thinking about killing myself again. 

I've realised that I've been suffering from depression for probably 6 years and never realised bc i just thought it was normal, even when I was self harming at 15yrs it didn't click that I was depressed bc I thought self harming was just attention seeking and I was going through a rough time, I'd felt like my (dads side) uncle, aunt, grandma and cousin didn't love me and only invited me over as a formality. Every year they would talk about going on a family holiday INFRONT of me and never asked me if I want to go, I really wanted to go, like stupidly insanely wanted to go, but never got to. They would constantly go do things together and I wanted to join in but never got invited. This really hurt bc it started when my grandad died who I was really close with, like I used to spend every day with him close, and my dad who id previously been seeing every weekend before my grandad died just left without word or trace. Just to clarify my mum and dad were not together for the majority of my life, my mum left him when I was something like 2yrs idk and thats when id start spending ever day with my grandad before and after school. 

But from smoking weed I've made friends that take me places and do things with me and care, I was already friends with my bestfriends before I started smoking weed but when I did start I quickly found that they also smoked weed so naturally we started hanging out and all found we really got on and started trying and then doing more drugs together and really bonded over several years. Made so many valuable memories that I will always look back on as being very good times. 

Kinda went on a heart felt deep vibe there so sorry about that just want to say that I am now on antidepressants and anxiety meds that have started helping me to start having a conversation with my family and sort of engaging with my brothers. I also have a counciling session later this month so here's to trying to get help. Hope everyone stays strong out there, there's always help. Peace.

I am a person who has rolled many times over the past  few years (not to brag but to give some context about prior use history.) I‚Äôve rolled in different sets and settings (festivals vs houses) and I always remember to hydrate well even when I‚Äôm out somewhere hot. 

Last night my boyfriend and I took the last of what was supposedly crystal mdma, and I suppose this is where we made our mistake. We had intended to buy a marquis kit for it before taking it when we originally got it two months ago, but we made a dumb mistake and accidentally bought a 10 panel drug test because we were rushing around last minute. So, we never ended up testing it (when we always do) and it was kind of an impulsive decision last night to finish the rest off. 

I took 210 mg after a 2 month break when I didn‚Äôt really roll when we took this stuff the first time‚Äî up from a conservative 190. I‚Äôm a lightweight with psychedelics, but I usually can‚Äôt get over the hump with MDMA without taking 190 which is a bit higher than my threshold dose. It has never been a problem for me to take up to 225 if it‚Äôs clean and good, and I‚Äôve actually taken more than that at once back when festivals were a thing and we were going back to back (6 weeks in between at the least.) I usually abide by the 3 month rule and try to because my tolerance builds up quick just like anyone else‚Äôs, it‚Äôs not good for me, yadda yadda.

So, we took our doses and after 90 minutes my boyfriend took more because he wasn‚Äôt feeling anything and I was rolling pretty hard. Around the 3 hour mark I took a redose of 225 which was so dumb in hindsight. As soon as I felt the redose kick in, my brain felt like it was on fire. Literally the most intense headache of my entire life, and I had been drinking water throughout the night. It felt like it started somewhere in the middle and spread to the entirety of my brain, and it felt like a lot of pressure. I ended up throwing up all night and I kept trying to hydrate but couldn‚Äôt keep anything down. I really don‚Äôt remember anything at all and I was lucky to have my boyfriend to take care of me. 

So what do you think? Did I overdo it with the redose, maybe didn‚Äôt drink enough water, or maybe it just wasn‚Äôt pure? I feel very dumb because I have never had this happen to me before. We are usually so careful, and with all of the different experiences I‚Äôve had I didn‚Äôt think it would be overdoing it to do that much in my own house. I usually am the only one who doesn‚Äôt actually throw up while rolling at a fest or in general, and I won‚Äôt be taking anymore for a long time after this.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,694020,public,confidence,self,Rolled last night and the redose made me feel like my brain was on fire- advice?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hruikx/rolled_last_night_and_the_redose_made_me_feel/,no_ads,0.0,1594870964.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm new here but I'm not new to drugs. While the furthest I've gone is smoking weed a few times, my friend who introduced me to it has done basically everything short of meth and heroin. He has in the past struggled with opioids and at it's worst, he was taking xanax and multiple different opioids on a regular basis (lean, hydrocodone, percocet, the list goes on) and only quit when his ex found him unable to move on the toilet. Another time, he took so much morphine that his bladder nearly burst from inability to piss.

He's now off the opioids and has moved past outright risk of death, only smoking weed (although far too much in my opinion) or at least he had until last night. At around 9pm he disappeared from all social media and message services and only came back at around 2pm this afternoon. It turns out that he took so much xanax that he blacked out, and this afternoon when I video-called him he was still unable to form a coherent sentence and was struggling to move. Later, he was video-calling his gf and she messaged me in horror saying that he took ket while on call. Apparently he looked terrible, and I'm glad I wasn't there to see it.

Now I'm not here to ask how to get him off drugs, as there is no easy answer and he is very hard to help considering that he is barely willing to help himself. I have nothing against weed or even the moderate stuff like ket and MDMA but the problem with my friend is he has a very addictive personality and is unable to control his usage. He had stayed off ket until recently but he felt the need to go back on it and since then he has begun to use it more and more. He has had a hard life and has deep mental health issues which can't be addressed by me as I'm not a licensed therapist. As I'm said, I'm not against moderate use of drugs that aren't horrifically dangerous and addictive, but he uses drugs for the wrong reasons.

On to the main point of this thread, I have become genuinely concerned for his safety. I'm no stranger to the science behind drugs and I'm aware that mixing in most cases is a bad idea. Considering xanax and ketamine are both depressants with overlapping effects, I am worried that my friend is doing himself serious damage by mixing them. He insists that he is fine but it's obvious that he is having some pretty bad physical effects. Not to mention, he has had numerous drug overdoses and bad mixing situations in the past and I am aware of the possibility of unseen permanent damage that makes him more susceptible to the physical effects of drugs. I don't know if it is against the rules to mention this part but he was 14 when he began to use drugs and still isn't at an age of full development now, so I know that he has also been far more susceptible to permanent changes in brain chemistry that might effect his mental health later on down the road. I don't really know what to do to support him as he just ignores that the problem exists.

Proofreading, I know that this may come off as a bit unorganised and waffle-y, but I have had a rollercoaster of a day and a pretty tough few weeks before this, and I have no idea what I should be doing.

I was completely fine walking through a foresty area with my friend, who had also taken the 2cb and smoked with me, when suddenly the sensation like i was on the verge of passing out hit me like a fucking truck. I lay down on the path, and proceeded to trip fucking balls for 3 hours. i was completely unable to stand up, any time i tried to raise my head, the trip intensified greatly. i stayed concious the whole time despite the constant sensation of passing out that rose and fell in intesity but stayed there the whole time. i tried opening my eyes at first and my brain fully could not comprehend what it was seeing. i just saw colours and shapes but could not tell at all that i was looking at a tree at all or whatever. i had to cover my eyes because the light that got through my closed eyelids was too much of a sensory overload for me. i also had zero closed eye visuals like i do sometimes when im super blazed(i get some light simple fractals sometimes when vvv stoned). the high felt nothing like weed or 2cb, it just felt like the sensation of losing conciousness except extended for like a 3 hour period, and a deep deep sense of panic,  it was fucking hell. 

after that i thought ok no more 2cb for a long time. a couple days later i smoked up with a friend and we went to tesco, as we where leaving i feel it happening again, and i hit the floor outside the shop with all the people in the queue outside looking at me like ‚Äúwtf is this kid doing‚Äù lol. it was not as intense at all this time but still the same sensation, nothing like a weed or any other psychadelic high. but again the only substanse i had taken this time was a regular sized zoot, nothing that i couldnt handle usually at all, and i was smoking with other people that normally have a lower tolerance than me, and my friends had no issue at all wheras i tripped sack. 


i had a couple of normal highs after that, but then yesterday it happened again, not as intense as the first time but still lasted like 3 hours of not even being able to sit upright. it genuinly feels like im having a fucking siezure or something, so i just wanna know if i‚Äôm just getting wierd highs because of the 2cb time something was triggered in my brain? or if this doesnt sound normal and i should see a doctor or smth haha

Got a little Whitney, put it in a blunt for now

**She was supposed to get me high, why the fuck I wanna die now?**

And I'm strung out on this dusty couch

In a big white ugly house, I told the bitch slow down

Stop runnin' your mouth

You holdin' my money, just shut up and count

My right nostril hasn't worked in a week

Plus the plug got work, like he servin' for a sheep

All my life I've been afraid of powder

All my life I've been afraid of power

Where did all that go?

The long decision always called my phone

Last supper I was fuckin' with the Corleones

I need somethin' stronger than a quarter zone

That can save me from the war unknown

Shoutout to Soulo (SOUL!) and rest in peace Alori Joh

The devil on the other side of the glory hole

Any time, any place, you could bet I'ma eat

Cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road

Look at all these new faces

I see, I see, I see

They're comin' on the plane but they're leavin' in suitcases

Been a criminal before schedule digital

Used the put the weed in the sole of my blue Asics

Hate myself up to strangers

But the raps are just way too flagrant, so

Here I go

Throwin' up a prayer, it's a Hail Mary

I've never been religious but I feel like the scripture's got it all there

It's not just gypsies and fairies, this could be my last breath

I'ma take my time, cause I'ma go out the same way I came in

Right by the pussy with nothin' on my mind

Does MDMA not allow you to get a boner? I did consume alcohol and weed throughout the night, could that have been a contributing factor to my shrivelled penis?

However, there are periods of my life where there is a lack of clarity. I've been feeling very dull and somewhat depressed from the lack of stimulation that my job and the quarantine has been creating. I've tried repeatedly to be completely amphetamine free but when I take 5 MG IR after a break, I find that suddenly, I remember what it feels like to wake up. The gears get going. I can focus.

The negatives: appetite, sleep (which kind of go away or stabilize through tolerance but I'm disliking the idea of being reliant on amphetamine both physically and mentally) Then also, my mood, aggressiveness, sociability all change and vary depending on variables that I think Vyvanse may be best suited for since its blood plasma levels remain much more constant perhaps than the fluctuating nature of adderall.

Positives: It fucking sucks realizing that I am able to be much more eloquent and feel a squeeze of brain activity that has been lacking. But its a pro.

Like are you telling me that for the majority of my career and life, I'll need this drug to function? It doesn't seem right. The only drug I can justify using regularly ironically is weed and that is much more detrimental to everyday functioning assuming you use it too much, which I do end up doing.

One thing I've noticed is that if I eat A LOT, most of the negatives go away. Since my appetite and metabolism are up more than baseline from exercising, it seems like keeping a full stomach and drinking a lot of water genuinely do tend to help somewhat but this is a lot of effort to keep the balance of things compared to a sober state, which is more of a natural flow and not false stimulation through a drug.

I've already tried it in the past to treat insomnia, but it didn't do much. Yet I'm planning to take it again today to see if something might have changed, so I'd be glad to hear your experience.

I stumbled upon this without trying but I think I found why seroquel is considered abusable. So by itself in my experience I had it prescribed because these doctors fucked my life up by cold turkey if me off 4mg Xanax a day. I need it for sleep. I don‚Äôt look forward to it‚Äôs effects while conscious because you just can‚Äôt keep your eyes open it feels like shit IMO.....but while asleep I have the most amazing dreams its like a vacation adventure. You can have nightmares and sleep paralysis though which isn‚Äôt very pleasant. I‚Äôd say the awesome dreams are the highlight of my day. I don‚Äôt take more than I‚Äôm supposed to 50mg knocks me out. So yea if you are locked up in prison or psych unit/rehab and want to escape this is a very viable option.

So anyway A couple weeks ago I started an amphetamine cycle because I had gain 25 pounds and wanted to shed the water weight and chill out on the eating/soda. One day I dosed a little too much and by the next m oh rning I felt almost catatonic so I asked a friend for a Xanax bar which I never do they usually decide when I get my relief. I hinted it was urgent and somehow managed to get one. It did the trick and than that night I took the first seroquel I had taken in a week. I had the normal thing happen it kicked in and I fall asleep, stop breathing from either sleep apnea or something idk what it is and I sit up gasping sometime I yell and cuss bc idk why it‚Äôs happening. That happens 5-6 times than I finally sleep for atleast 8 hours. When I woke up I thought in my head ‚Äúshit Im possibly not going to feel the amphetamines‚Äù or something like that. I dosed the usual amount and at first I felt like I needed more but I waited and noticed I did feel it I had the energy but I didn‚Äôt have any of the amphetamine psychosis warning thoughts which I think a lot of you would understand. It‚Äôs thoughts that are the beginnings of delusional thoughts like paranoid shit I shouldn‚Äôt have to explain it but it‚Äôs not just paranoid ones it‚Äôs thinking you are special and shit like extra sensory perception type shit. It blocks that type of thinking. It‚Äôs like my mind is totally blank and I‚Äôm just sitting there with no euphoria unless it‚Äôs coming from an outside source. I wasn‚Äôt able to think to myself what if this was real and what if that was possible that would be so interesting. When I go too long on amphetamines you can see my facial expression change to a meth face like my eyebrows are simultaneously angry and like ‚ÄùWTF!?‚Äù(if my eyebrows could talk lol) the seroquel takes that away and keeps me calm so there‚Äôs no doubt a danger in going way farther into sleep deprivation even tho I don‚Äôt skip sleep a lot of people do and I think the seroquel can like literally mask that but underneath you could be completely BAT SHIT INSANE.. which reminds me of my psych ward stay when I committed myself out of self punishment and a possible benzo taper whatever it was a huge mistake I was traumatized fuck it. I brought the psych ward up bc someone came in I knew from little league/knee high baseball he looked tweak the fuck out and someone told me ‚Äúyea he said he smoked seroquel off foil for a long time‚Äù. I never put any thought into it I just considered him in an episode and possibly he‚Äôs like those dumb kids in high school who would say dumb shit like ‚Äúyooo bro I got high off my moms Bentyl‚Äù it‚Äôs just stupid idiotic shit....but I think he was a meth head who would use seroquel habitually to mask his psychosis. Because he would have these sudden outbursts that a meth head who is psychotic does but they usually don‚Äôt stop. He had control to stop. I noticed when playing call of duty I would snap for a few seconds and yell shit at the game with curse words even the c word and shit and after a few dozen times I became self aware of how aggressive it sounded.

A little backstory: I started smoking cannabis in the beginning of 2019. Totally enjoyable, was able to function and use it constructively. Then about 8 months later I decided to trip for the first time. Took about 1.5 tabs acid. Everything went great. After several hours and coming down for a while, I decided to smoke. Worst decision of my life. Became very delusional and paranoid. I thought I was in hell. Now, after the trip, my relationship with weed has totally changed. 

I stopped enjoying smoking after this experience because I would become scared and paranoid. So I stopped smoking in early 2020. 

This week, I was prescribed cannabis for PTSD related symptoms by my doctor. I tried a quarter of an edible last night and what happened really scared me. 

I started to become very paranoid and anxious. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how I was going to die, and nothing I would ever do would change that or matter enough to impact the world around me. This was so much more intense than any anxiety Ive experience before. I became obsessed with this for several minutes, and called a friend to calm me down. When we talked, I don‚Äôt really know how to describe the delusions I was having. My friend said an uncommon word twice in our conversation and I thought that it was a codeword to tell me he knew what was going on in my head. I began to think some sort of Truman Show type things- like everyone around me had a secret and they were fooling me together. These delusions popped into my head and I was still able to doubt them, but they were there as possibilities. This experience reminded me of how confused I got when I was having my bad trip. 

I am basically really scared my mind can do this. I want to be able to have a constrictive relationship with weed again. I fear that my paranoia is not normal and indicates that I have something wrong with me and need to talk to a doctor. I fear talking to a doctor and being put on meds or losing some of my freedoms. I want to be able to treat my symptoms of PTSD and not feel so fucking crazy. 
Is any of this normal? Is this so concerning that I should talk to a doctor? Can delusions just be thought through until they dont bother me or am I on a slippery slope?

From my research, it seems like I was at plateau 2. It was a pretty good trip, a little more intense than how high I regularly get on weed, but nothing too special. I didn't hallucinate, just felt nice and high. I did throw up the entire contents of my stomach at the start of my trip, but I felt much better afterwards, and it wasn't unpleasant enough that I would swear off the drug forever.

What *will* make me swear off the drug forever is this godawful comedown. I made the wise choice of tripping the night before my flight from Seattle to Chicago, and while being residually high certainly made the airport more fun, the intense nausea was *not* welcome. I genuinely felt on the verge of throwing up the entire day. It's been three days now since I tripped and I still feel a tinge of nausea every time I yawn - not fun.

But the worst part is the fact that I can't seem to achieve orgasm. This has never happened to me before - occasionally I've gotten overstimulated during sex and been unable to finish, but I've always been able to make myself come when I'm going solo. Last night, I was a little turned on going to bed, so I tried masturbating; after what felt like ages of getting nowhere, I gave up and was able to fall asleep. However, at about 6 this morning I woke up again to pee and was too horny to fall back asleep, so I tried again - still no luck! The fuck, body?

He was moving a lot of and making a fair bit but was not a rival to the more violent dealers.

Yet they still pulled up on him, while he was walking back home. They beat him badly and then stabbed him repeatedly. Once in the stomach and again in the back. This stuff happens all the time when it comes to gang conflict and harder drugs but not usually the smaller dealers.

He‚Äôs told me that for the past few years the LSD market has become more and more competitive, as it‚Äôs only run by one gang and I‚Äôm sad my dealer got caught up in all this. It used to be people ordering it of the darknet and private sources and then selling it but they can‚Äôt compete with the prices either, as the new gang are selling 150ug for as little as ¬£1. It‚Äôs become a dark time to become an LSD dealer in my city...

I don‚Äôt want to buy LSD knowing that they built their business by stabbing and attacking all the competition, I think I‚Äôll stick to the darknet. Possibly it‚Äôs always been like this and my city took a while to catch up, I‚Äôve just been used to acid dealers being more laid back and stoner type guys, not gang members

However at the same time, i want to quit because no matter how many times I tell myself that no one cares about me, I know deep down that a lot of people care. Obviously everyone wanted me to quit. And yes I put in all my effort to become clean but failed after 2 weeks. Now, I'm literally lying to my boyfriend, my family and my friends.

So when someone finally likes me , I feel like I'm doing everything just for him to stay. I have always been a very honest person and I was known for my honesty. I could never lie. But I feel like I finally have a personality and I dont know who I would be without my pills. 

I feel guilty but its obviously my fault. I rly dont know what to do. And I get so triggered when people shit talk drugs. Like just coz everyone says they are bad dosen't mean, u also judge it and follow the bandwagon. Idk just my perspective.

When I was younger(15, am 19 now) I had a growing interest in weed, which I could talk about with my parents. I expressed that I would like to try it, so we went on a trip to Amsterdam(which is about a 1h drive) to buy my first weed.

They bought a joint for me, which I got to do later in the week at home but that only made my throat sore as I had never smoked before so I proposed to do edibles instead. So next time we went to buy some we got spacecakes, they did work and I had a great experience.


Following the next couple of years I started using more and more, from once a week to every day to multiple times a day. I knew my parents were fine with my usage, but I also knew that they wouldn‚Äôt like me doing it so much so I had to hide my usage. 

I began to smoke only when they were out the house, I encouraged my mom to walk with the dogs so I had a moment to myself to smoke in the backyard. But although this method made wasn‚Äôt as risky, I couldn‚Äôt smoke as much as I would like. 

So I found a different way, we have this window in our bathroom leading to a flat roof I could sit on to smoke, I did that for months without them knowing. Until today when I was running the shower while sitting outside on the flat roof and my dad knocked on the door. I tried to get in as fast as I could, but right as he opened the door he saw me jump out the window. This happened yesterday and I haven‚Äôt talked to either of my parents since then.

I don‚Äôt use text ever on reddit so apologies if this looks like a shit post.

So a bit of required backstory: About nine months ago I had a brake up that dragged on way longer than need. It was a good thing at one point but things changed and it didn‚Äôt work anymore, but I wasn‚Äôt sure what it was that didn‚Äôt work or at least not smart enough (at the time) to recognize it.
     Following this I worked on my self more, found Weed through friends and it evolved from a fun thing on the weekends at parties to a full blown hobby that I‚Äôm super invested in (and have fun with).

So my question was, what was it that didn‚Äôt work in my past relationship?

The answer (in story form üòÇüòÇ): So I smoke before I go to bed as usual and felt like bopping to the new Juice WRLD album (what a album btw, damn). After finishing the album (and bong pack), I was super toasted and when that happens I tend to deep think. Well I was also swiping on the Ol‚Äôtinder and matched with a girl who had some pretty similar interests. So this fried brain of mine connected that with my old relationship in trying to make it work with a different person this time around. Then it clicked, the whole reason why my last relationship failed, in one word. 

Co-dependency. 

Throughout the relationship we were mostly co-dependent (which yeah tends to not be good as I found out). Then at one point we moved on to another stage of our lives and she wanted to be more independent. Well I either did not figure that out or was too blind and deaf to realize it at the time.

So I suppose lesson of the story, don‚Äôt be                  co-dependent too much and getting baked can lead to brake through thoughts.

So they switched him again, but the doc gave him ritalin a second time, but changed the brand. Suddenly, it was working.

I revealed to him that he was literally taking the same drug, but he was sure it was different. I told him two, three times. Showed him the chemical name, and dosage was the same.

I lost my house, my son, my fiancee of 10 years, my business i sunk 80k into and blew through 400k cash i earned before i got into this mess, plus had to sell 35k brand new car I bought , paid 15k off it...

I cant stop thinking of the past, so now i get deeper into addiction to block the past thoughts of my mistakes caused by drugs..

I am fucking using drugs to stop thinking about drugs..... wow, I really have fucked up and lost everything,  back with mum and dad.... lucky they have money and let me live here free, food here, nice room, lovely house, offered to take me on their holiday to mallorca,  so I cant be too hard on myself, I have drug workers bending over backward to help me.

I just think alot of people must get in this mess, ok not to the extreme and there  is a hell of alot more I'm not going to go into, but if I had no family I would be homeless, I let that sink in and realise that it can be rebuilt up,  I am only 31 as they say and have done it before, at the end of the day I'm now not a fuckin walking zombie , thin as fuck, eyes looking dark and my face all gaunt ..

Please people be careful out there, it's so easy to get sucked in, I always told myself I would not touch certain drugs, but I did and now I watch on as my business earns loads of money and I'm no longer a part..... FUCK........

Me mum says well you got your health, you had an OD and I watched you turn blue and be brought back to life, if you carried on and we didn't take you in and beg you to stay at home you would be dead.. I need looking after, me parents are terrified of what will happen to me if they pass... or when more like....

I have never directly hurt anyone, my ex, really wants me back due to my progress and her been my first love and since the age of 12 we have been off and on,  so we have a special bond nothing can break, but I have nearly broke that bond.... so I have hurt people and nearly destroyed them... 

Sorry for the post, I'm trying to help and show to be careful , dont be like me, don't look at research chemicals like an idiot and do your best at everything and love those who love you, In the drug game NOBODY is your friend.... once the drugs are gone you will realise that...

Obviously, my first moves are to shower, brush teeth, fix hair, clean clothes, etc. 

When I do this I feel like listening to music and kinda forcing myself to sing along helps (possibly just because I haven‚Äôt used my voice in hours and to acclimate myself to using it again) 

Once I go out I feel like I have to have a body spray and gum to help with probably smelling like cigarettes (even though I‚Äôve showered and brushed my teeth, I‚Äôve def chain smoked on the way to wherever I‚Äôm going )

Do coke or drink maybe a couple times a year at most.

On the weekend, drank, did some good coke and smoked a bit of weed, and ended the night with about 1mg of xanax. Didn't even go that hard. Probably 10 beers, 5-6 smallish lines, little bit of weed.

That night got home sweet, felt great, went to sleep. Next day, and the following couple of days since then I feel I've been in the fight or flight response. I've never had this kind of weird 'neither here nor there', edge of psychosis kind of  feeling of anxiety and feeling just totally fucked.  Ive had tapered amounts of benzos in the last few days (1/4 or a bar) to try and help anxiety/sleep. I've never done big amounts of benzos or cocaine in my life, and the few times i have done it they have been small amounts and I haven't had these issues.

It's kind of like being in a constant panick attack but every other attack has 'triggers'. I'm worried that mixing booze/coke/xanax/weed when I don't do that often has fucked me up. It's really weird. Especially the delay in anxiety/hangover. 

I've had panic attacks before but this is different. This is weird. 

Any Ideas? Cheers.

At age 12 I found a bottle of vicodin in my parents cabinet. I was hooked from right then and there. By 13, at the end of my freshman year of high school, I was a full blown addict with opiates. By 14, I discovered adderall and tramadol. This was my sophomore year. Every day before school started I'd take roughly 12-15 10mg hydros, two 20mg addys when I got to school and roughly 400mg of tramadol before 2nd period. Halfway through, I graduated to fentanyl and oxycontin in place of my hydrocodone/vicodin. No less than 160mg of oxys or roxis, and if I could find fentanyl I'd usually get the sucker things or just suck the gel out of the patches. This continued, every day, throughout my entire time in high school, an addict to multiple substances. 
     By 15 I shot up heroin for the first time, it was lovely, but for whatever reason I never got into it heavily. By the time I was 18, I've done everything there was to do. But for many years, opiates were my true love. By 22, I was using no less than 200mg of oxy/roxi per day, with the occasional 80mg of adderall here and there to feel extra sweet. By 24, I discovered my love for benzos. Mind you, I was still using opiates heavily and by this time I was also using heavy doses of Xanax and K-pins. When I say heavy, I mean 8-10 bars in one handful. Somehow, I was lucky to never have OD'd all but one time but I was wittingly courting death as I was convinced nothing could kill me. January of this year I decided to try a suboxone program for my opiate use, 24mg a day and it worked alright for me. But I couldn't stop the zans, and picked up a meth binging habit. 
     Fast forward to the end of April, I beat up my step dad for no reason during a black out. I went to jail, blacked out, bailed myself out, blacked out, walked home, still blacked out, fought my step dad again, ate the remaining 9 bars I had (according to my mom) and tried fighting the police when they came to take me back to jail. Fast forward to now. I'm 26, just celebrated my first birthday sober since I was 11yrs old. I'm facing 9 months in prison, thankfully because of covid I was only locked up for just shy of a month. I nearly died in jail from the benzo withdrawal. It was horrible. When I got bailed out at the end of May, it took no less than an hour for me to accept that it's time to change. I signed myself in to a PHP program which lasted until the middle of June, graduated and am now doing IOP. Which I'm on track to graduate from next week, on the mark of two months sober for me. The longest stint of sobriety in my whole life.
     I don't know why I decided to write this, and for the sake of time I've skipped some incredible details. But maybe it can inspire someone. Nothing about this is easy, but if you find a reason to live it makes it worth it. For me, that reason is my little sister and my girlfriend who I absolutely adore. She's a fucking Saint, and I'm blessed that she's been there for me during the last 4 months, the hardest 4 months, of my life. This community is great.

I'm in my 40s, so not exactly a wise old sage, but I've spent large portions of my life completely sober, a casual poly addict, a hardcore iv user, and nowadays I'm just an occasional psychedelics user.

Here's the best advice I can give you that crosses multiple substances:

Learn to recognize a bad experience and force yourself to sit in the moment.

Whether it's a manic episode or delusions, it's often possible for you to be able to meditate in that very moment.

And the more you do this, the better you'll get at it.

Close your eyes, distance the ""you"" who is observing and the ""you"" who is experiencing, and watch.  That's it.  

Watch yourself go through the panic, anxiety, mania, whatever, as if you were watching someone else go through it from the inside.

I know this sounds woo woo, but it's just a meditation muscle you're learning to flex in a high pressure situation. 

When I would have an issue, it would often feel very electric for me.  Like electricity under every fiber of skin trying to bounce out.  And I would want to do rash things - call or text people, go places outside my safe setting, etc 

At first I would just turn off phones, lock doors, designate trip sitter friends I could text, etc, but one day I decided to try and meditate through it even though I'd never been very successful at meditating before that.  

It worked. I made it through the episode by sitting still and watching it as it passed.  And every time it happened after that, I got better at sitting in the moment and letting it pass.

Now I kinda look forward to the mushroom trips that make me super manic.  I'm able to sit in it, not rush, and then channel the manic energy into art.

It's kinda beautiful if you can get the hang of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Me and about 8 other of my closest friends every year do to an AirBNB in the middle of beautiful northern California during the summer, where we kick back, have some fun with substances, and do a whole lot of fuckin'

&amp;#x200B;

This year was particularly hard on us and we almost cancelled thanks to COVID. Not having seen each other for months, we ultimately decided to still go ahead with the trip on the condition that we work extra hard to quarantine in the weeks before &amp; after.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**The setup**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The mild depression I'd been having in the background for the past couple of weeks melted away the moment we all arrived. Beautiful, amazing views looking over Sonoma valley in a grand and inspiring house with my best mates. Friday night we had a great night rolling, having some G &amp; K, and just being in good company. It was dancy, it was horny, it was a whole lot of fun, and it was long overdue.

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday, we had planned on all doing a candyflip later in the day with acid -&gt; E. One of my friends managed to get hold of a DMT vape which I was curious about. We all tried a little bit of it by itself early in the day, before we started anything. Was a very interesting experience - felt a lot like acid except much more immediate, and much more ""relaxed"". I coughed a whole lot, unable to keep the DMT in my lungs long enough to get anything more out of it except a some relaxed &amp; fun short tripping. Little did I know just how powerful this substance could become. I put the DMT away while we relaxed &amp; had some lunch before we started our trip.

&amp;#x200B;

Time to start the trip. I took 1 tab of acid along with everyone else, and we had a wonderful summer stroll through idyllic rolling California hills. I felt a deep sense of warmth, almost to the point of tears. This was exactly what we needed in our lives. The trip was different from many I've had before - I had this unusual sense of clarity, almost like how you feel when on Adderall except I didn't feel stimmy at all. I now know that I was still under the influence of the DMT afterglow from hours earlier - my trip had almost this sense of purity to it, where everything felt like it was just right.

&amp;#x200B;

After after hours of fun conversation and good times in the great room, we decided it's time to start the flip and take the E during sundown. We all take our dose. Me and two other friends decide to do a line of K for the come up while we're on acid &amp; doing nitrous. It's sunset, and the combonation of these four drugs together help create the most amazing hills I've ever seen in my life. I yell at my 2 friends who partook on the same train I did to come over and sit next to me. We watch these magnificent hills in awe right as the peak to Sandstorm by darude hits, giving us all a great laugh. How could one moment line up so perfectly?

&amp;#x200B;

**Into the flip &amp; losing control**

&amp;#x200B;

An hour later, the E is in effect and we're fully into the roll. But something is off - I notice the feeling of clarity never fully goes away. I don't get drunk in the waves of E like I usually do, and the acid still is playing a dominant part. The visuals are amazing, but I still feel... on earth, more than I'd like to be. Knowing we rolled the night before, some of us decided to take more E, including me. It helps, but I'm not feeling devious and touchy in the way that I want. I feel the E physically building in me, but it's stuck, as if I'm trying to drive up a muddy hill and my wheels are skidding. I decide at this point to take some G, since it always synergizes great with E &amp; helps abate the effects of Acid. Perhaps if I toned down the psycs I could enter that devious headspace I wanted, to take full advantage of the night.

&amp;#x200B;

This works well for about 30 minutes until that subtle rolly physical feeling inside of me continues to build and build beyond the point where I can handle it. I feel it in my heart, in my groin, in my lips. Just a constant... energy, a constant feeling of positive energy waves inside. I felt far from reality, and not in a nice drunk way. Imagine what it feels like to be in the middle of a wave of E, except it's constant - non stop, unrelenting. Even though this energy comes from a good place, I felt as if I was drowning under it. I was trapped in a tornado of non-stop sensation. All I could do was let out literal howls to help control it. My friends were helping me overcome it by talking to me about everyday things - asking me what color my car is, how I moved out to CA, etc... helping me stay on the ground. It helped, every so slightly.

&amp;#x200B;

Once the G subsided, I took some K to help dissassociate from the constant overwhelming waves I was feeling. While this helped, it also pushed me into a deeper state of head fog. I figured, at the very least I could try and wait until everything wears off while under the K. I see &amp; feel me snapping back into being physically connected to my friends to back into the real world as each mini-wave blasts over me. It still feels nice, but my mind can hardly comprehend or handle what I was experiencing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Becoming hyper-real**

&amp;#x200B;

It's at this point, I'm a few hours into the flip &amp; something in my head tells me to ""get the DMT"". This wasn't a craving or just me mindlessly throwing more drugs into my cocktail to see what works, I somehow -knew- this is exactly what I needed, as if a higher consciousness was directing me.

&amp;#x200B;

I took one big, long hit. A friend looks at me, laughs and says ""Don't cough!"". I feel the urge to cough and then suddenly, I have complete control. I physically see my instinct to cough manifest in front of my eyes, as a kind of code from the universe, and I quite literally alter this code infront of me to remove the need to cough. Doing so fully unlocking the true power of the DMT inside of me.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, every feeling, every constant physical wave inside of me, every thought, every physical experience, every awareness of every atom bursts into the room. I have never seen a sight so beautiful in my life. Perfect geometry, perfect shapes, the walls become pure crystal and I see every single energy and vibration and possibility of every atom, and I see and how they work right in front of my eyes. I see how my friends move their hands and how the code of the universe calculates how they move through the air. I see impossible hyper-cube shapes &amp; am able to perfectly comprehend them in an instant. I'm not even talking about the floaty, trance-like visual experience you get from Acid or K. I was in \*complete\* perfect control, and was completely present in the real world - except a version that is now covered in perfect geometry, colors, shapes, nets of dust &amp; light, &amp; spirits. I had quite literally transcended into becoming a hyper-real being of sorts.

&amp;#x200B;

The craziest part about it all wasn't even the perfect beauty of everything, or the auras, or the hyper-dimensionality of the shapes I saw. It was how I had complete clarity &amp; control. I was able to fully comprehend the entirety of every wave I had felt &amp; actually process it. Every time a negative/overwhelming feeling, or thought, or question built up inside me, I could process it and correct my reality. I could fully understand everything. I knew exactly what part of the universe's code needed looking at to correct the feeling, state of mind, or desire. I was able to comprehend all of my friend's conversations. The music and how it transformed the space. The impossible shapes and how their inter-dimensionality connected with the real-world. The physical flow of time. To put it bluntly, I literally had a sense of omnipotence. You know how when you're really high on acid and you can almost feel too overwhelmed with how much sensation+beauty you are perceiving? Now imagine you had completely control and awareness of it all. That's where I was. And the entire time, I was in this this complete state of bliss. Every moment, ever color, every atom, every part of me was perfect. I felt for the first time in my life what it was like to experience true perfection.

&amp;#x200B;

More of my friends join me and they become one with this hyper-reality with me. We have a blissful evening all the way until sunrise.

&amp;#x200B;

**The morning after**

&amp;#x200B;

The experience was nothing short of profound. The entire Sunday was just feeling in this constant state of bliss and understanding. We relax, have showers together, do a little bit more DMT &amp; K in the AM for one last time (it's especially beautiful during sunrise), and enjoy some K on the side to help our day of bliss. For the first time since I was a kid, I have this feeling of absolutely presence. I'm 100% present, and enjoying every moment for what it is, and this feeling lasts even when I'm ""sober"" after we stop doing K/nitrous/etc in the afternoon. That whole day I felt like what it must be like to be a godly spirit amongst my deity-friends, as we enjoyed each other in absolutely purity, in this castle looking over a beautiful golden valley. I felt like I had become enlightened. Me and my friends cuddle a whole lot, take care of each other, and just allow ourselves to truly appreciate the present moment. And we aren't even high on anything other than the occasional nitrous hit!

&amp;#x200B;

Two days later despite going through the comedown from the rolls, it's uncanny how I still have this... glow, this spirit inside me that has been activated. I feel like for the first time in years I'm able to enjoy the little moments, the love, and the beauty of the present moment absolutely fully.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an atheist but it's hard for me to have this kind of experience and not feel like a spiritual connection inside of me has been awakened. The wildest thing is after that entire amazing experience, I don't feel a craving or draw to do it again. I'm not ""looking forward to the next time"" in the same way I might look forward to the next time I do a fun acid trip with friends or a roll. I feel a sense of pure completeness for having experienced it. Usually when I hear of ""too good to be true"" drug experiences, it's scary how much they control the person who experienced it. It's why things like heroine, meth, or crack are ""not even once"" for me. I don't want to experience something I wasn't meant to experience and then lose control over myself chasing the dragon. But in this case, I experienced perfection and feel humbled by it. I feel more in control over my true self than I ever have before. I could die tomorrow or die in 60 years never having done it again and that's OK. I have this deep sense of completeness in my spirit.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,693857,public,confidence,self,Experienced absolute perfection becoming a hyper-real transcendental being during a DMT candy flip.,0,[],0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hrd7mu/experienced_absolute_perfection_becoming_a/,no_ads,0.0,1594800637.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The only thing is that we both have to drive, the weather is going to be 80 degrees, and I just don't think it's a good idea overall since we could overheat. Also, the drug page listed above classifies the pill as MDA. My dealer (very trustworthy) said that it is ecstasy. Some other pages list it as MDA or MDXX (not sure what that means).

We're all going to a fire on the lake afterwards, so I think the best bet would be to take it there.

I live in Europe and here the transdermal patch it's not available. 
I started with 1.25mg under the tongue , then 2.5mg, then 5mg, increasing the dose every 3 days, but nothing happened even at 5mg. Then I went up to 10mg , then 15mg and still nothing happened. now I'm on 20mg since 3 days , it takes me 1 hour to take 4 pills of 5 mg sublingual . I was very confident about selegiline, since I red a lot of positive experience here about people, for depression and cognition, fast acting, judging even 5mg sublingual difficult to manage because it's too ""pushing"".
Unfortunately I'm not experiencing nothing of that. The only thing that I experienced is the disgusting amphetamines metabolites that gives me that ""staying high"" drunk sensation for some hours, some hallucinations like seeing or hearing something and some overthinking with difficult to sleep at night. Zero positive effect....is here someone experiencing the same? It's normal and I have to wait more time? Or it's a inequivocabile sign that it doesn't work? 
I red a lot of people saying that taking it sublingual increase its bioavailability, so if you take 1.25 sublingual it's like taking 5mg oral . Is that true? Or it's just supposition without scientific evidence?  So because I'm taking 20mg sublingual it's like if I'm taking 40 mg oral?

In this interesting paper that I suggest you all to unlock with sci-hub using the relative doi and read entirely, there are evidence of selegiline effectiveness for narcolepsy at 20 - 40 mg oral range, and 30 - 60 mg oral range for depression (because of the activation of both mao-b and mao-a) , so why it's not working for me? Maybe because 20 mg sublingual are equal to 60 mg oral and the activation of serotonin cover the activation of dopamine? (I can't handle serotonin and ssri, it exacerbate fatigue, cognition and memory problems , sleepiness, destroy libido and makes me fat) 
Or maybe because the positive effect on narcolepsy and depression are just linked to the more amphetamines produced by the oral administration?

I highly suspect him taking some kind of pill and the only ones I can see him using are Xanax or perc 30‚Äôs. Please let me know if you think these are signs of either, and if there are any other signs to look out for.

1. He‚Äôs usually goofy and happy but definitely had trouble focusing and is kind of a spaz naturally. Sometimes randomly for an hour or two (maybe once or twice a week) he will get super lovey with me, telling me how in love he is and how excited he is to have a life together etc. He will also call our coworkers and tell them how much he loves and appreciates them, same with his family. His voice gets a little higher pitched and raspy.

2. Some nights he will aggressively itch his nose, like it‚Äôs so itchy for an hour or something. He is also acting a little ‚Äòoff‚Äô when these itching fits occur.

3. He used to binge drink really hard until a month or two ago. Now if he has a couple drinks and doesn‚Äôt continue drinking he falls asleep very quickly. 

He takes daily klonopins for anxiety prescribed by his doctor. 

At what point is Xanax/Percocet a real problem? He is able to function and does his job well (sales) but if he is taking something I don‚Äôt know how regularly it is because he is clearly hiding it from me. I‚Äôm obviously worried for his health and want to talk to him about it, but I‚Äôm wondering if I should just leave it alone.

I really feel better now, sleeping better, im not bored and demotivated all the time... I chose to completely cut out drinking for 5 months plus ( let's aknowledge i can be talkative w friends w/ a drink and i drink in 90% of cases to enhance whatever other drugs i take - alcohol only is lame, i hate being drunk ). 


In 10 days i have a test at university. I take my mph as prescribed and drink coffee everyday, but am tryng to stop nicotine ( relapsed for a few days after 3 months w/ ). Now im sitting here, the day feels so long and i have practically too much time ( yaeh i have a fuckton to learn - its development biology/ molecular cell biology ). My uni is online, because corona. I feel the very strong urge to take my dry herb vape when im going to uni tomorrow.. Even if i know i will feel guitly, paranoid and empty when i smoke before taking my examen. Im so disgusted by myself i cant even not drink or smoke for 7 days. Took lsd  ( my 8th time ) recently, which caused a lot of repressed toughts to reusrface ( i am not that person i want to be / im wasting my potential / i felt so bad about mysefl that i had a slight /////  bad toughts ). I love drugs, taken occasionally, to enhance a activity, they enrich our lives. But my use has at this point nothing ti with fun or.. Lets say lsd put a lot in persceptive i havent been able to.

What helps to be sober ? I will be smoking weed after the 25th ( so its a 18 day break ). What are your tips/tricks/advices to stay sober ? How do enjoy sober life ? What should i do ? 

Smoking weed / w mph ( plus 1-3 days without sleep every week ) lead to paranoia bout friends, paranoia when listening on headphones, i stopped listening music 7 months ago ( which i was very enthusiastic about when younger now 22) , an eternal dissatisfaction with myself. I have a case of schizophrenia ( son of brother of my grandfather ) in family from weed, i know im in the prime age to have it. But to be honest, if i were suspectible i had already had. But i should also admit - alcohol has caused a lot more misery before i begun  smoking at 18 ( landing in th er or being depressed or running away or cutting myself or being aggressive ). Yeah i should also add had a self mutilation / anorexia episode at 14 resp 12. Puberty aint pretty. Point my life was so much better when i smoked once a week, had a healthy workout routine, took acid 1-2 times in a year, drink with friends - i was so much happier, drugs spicing up life but not being the cause of every joy...

What makes you enjoy being alive ? What fullfills yourself ? Sometimes i feel im a empty shelf of myself , a shadow of my former self ( before age 19 ). What gives your live meaning ?

I find it great to have one with me, just in case, and think that the dangers are often overrated by prescribers. No addiction (can go 2 weeks without), no reduced effect (still on minimum dose, same as 2 years go, and it still hits like a horse kick!).

*I'll define* ***""minimum dose""*** *as what is typically used for that benzo. That is often 1/4 of a pill or bar: 2.5 mg Diazepam (Valium) / 1.5 mg Bromazepam / 0.4 mg (?) Alprazolam (Xanax) / 0.5 mg Lorazepam (half pill, not quarter!)*

Tips:

1. Make sure that the minimum really isn't enough before you double it. Wait for the full effect, and don't double it before it kicked in! For Bromazepam, that can well be 3 hours, unfortunately.  
My typical beginner mistake was that I took 1/4 pill, didn't feel anything, and took another 1/4 only 1 hour later.  
I never ever need more than minimum dose, but others might have to take double.
2. 80 minimum doses should be enough for half a year at least; better is enough for 1 year. At half a year, that's almost a pill every other day, and that's really borderline addictive. E. g.: 20 pills of Bromazepam, 6 mg per pill, quarter them -&gt; 80 doses.  
The mistake that prescribers make is that they hand out 80 doses at once (20 pills that can be quartered). A lot can go wrong with an inexperienced user, e. g. take it on 80 consecutive days, and you have a major addiction problem!
3. Take it irregularly as needed. E. g. for me, sometimes 3 - 4 per week is required when it is a very bad week (Bromazepam has a long half-life, so still dazed the next day). But there should be entire weeks without taking any. Definitely don't spread it evenly long-term by taking 1/4 pill every other day! Likely addition and reduced effect coming soon.
4. Use the bought time to improve your situation. Medical help: Is there a suitable SSRI for your situation? If yes, you'd have to take it daily and it might affect other areas of your life, but there is no risk of addiction or reduced effect. Therapy. Improving the situation objectively, removing what causes the stress from your life. The usual tips: Outside, nature, exercise. Therapy works for some.
5. Don't ever use it recreationally during the time you use it medically. But you can seize the moment: If you genuinely had to take a minimum dose that day for strictly medical reasons, why not have a few beers or opioids in the evening.

Personally, I had such an experience about a year and a half ago. Myself &amp; my college roommate at the time, who I‚Äôd been close friends with since high school, had tickets to see Tame Impala (I imagine he‚Äôs probably pretty popular on this sub lol). One of our mutual &amp; close high school friends flew 2,000 miles to meet us at the show. None of us had ever seen him before, but we were all very huge fans, to the extent that I would say he was (and is) probably all three of our favorite artists. At the time I‚Äôd done acid a few times, and debated dropping a tab for the show, but I had to be up @9am the next day, so I pivoted to something a little shorter. I had been meaning to try mdma for a while &amp; figured it would be the perfect opportunity, little did I know how right I was. I took a pretty strong dose for a first time, and within an hour I knew something special was about to occur. I was with two of my closest friends, seeing our favorite band (if you can even call them a band). They/he came on just as I was starting to peak... I had abstained from weed for the first 90 min of the roll, because I wanted to feel the M before adding to it, but during the 2nd song in the set we sparked up. The crowd was absolutely infectious. I‚Äôve seen probably 50+ concerts (Paul McCartney, Rolling Stones, Arctic Monkeys, Tyler the Creator, U2, The Killers, Flume, The Who, Migos, Brockhampton, to name a few of the notable ones) and never have I seen a crowd so into the music &amp; just happy to be there... Definitely helped that something like 90% of the crowd was between 18 &amp; 25 and off their face fucked up. But in that specific moment (ironically the song he was playing was called The Moment), the weed, peak roll, synths in the song, light show, and crowd energy all converged together, and I knew immediately I would never be that happy again. I have since wondered if I picked a too perfect occasion to try md for the first time. It was not just that I realized how spectacular M can be, the concert was also exceptionally spectacular in itself. My two friends, who were both on nothing stronger than weed, described it as the single most amazing and cathartic thing they had ever experienced. We had perfect seats, the crowd was awesome, the acoustics of the venue were insane, and possibly most importantly, his stage effects are absolutely unrivaled. Quite honestly, I don‚Äôt think there is another artist on the planet that is even in the same realm as him, stage effects wise. I‚Äôve rolled maybe 3 times since, each spaced out by an average of about 5 months &amp; have had great experiences, but nothing close to THAT. I know better than to chase the dragon. I know there is no possible way to replicate that bliss. In most ways, I am thankful to have had such a beautiful experience, but it is a little disappointing to know that such a state of pure joy exists and I will never be able to reach it again. I know a lot of people take good times &amp; happiness for granted, or assume that they can replicate something, but I knew in that moment that I would never be that content &amp; that high again. Has anyone had similar experiences, and how do you avoid comparing subsequent experiences to that one? Every concert I‚Äôve been to since, I enjoy, but there‚Äôs a little part of me that says ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs not as good as that concert‚Äù, and conversely every roll since has been awesome and immensely enjoyable, but I still find myself comparing it to the first one.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,693821,public,confidence,self,Experiences so good they kinda scare you?,0,[],0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hr8xkp/experiences_so_good_they_kinda_scare_you/,no_ads,0.0,1594786237.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, I sometimes can be jittery and nervous on it.  I also can be impulsive and get into weird moods on it, depending on the day.  Sometimes it's fine, but sometimes I can get nervous.

I am taking a two day exam this weekend.  Each day is about three hours.  I am definitely taking Vyvanse the second day because I don't care if I can sleep.  But on the first day, I am wondering if I should take adderall or Vyvanse.  The test starts at 12:00 PM on day 1 and 1:00 PM on day 2.  The pills I have are 10 mg Adderall IR or 40 mg Vyvanse.  I would either take one of adderall or one of Vyvanse.

What do you all think? I think I would be less nervous on Vyvanse the first day but would hate to have to take the second day on like 3 hours of sleep.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,693807,public,confidence,self,Need Help Choosing Between Adderall and Vyvanse for a Two Day Exam,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hr8ax3/need_help_choosing_between_adderall_and_vyvanse/,no_ads,0.0,1594784290.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So for this whole year I've actually been really good (only been smoking weed, using caffeine and nicotine - good for my standards) until about the last month or two when I began to over - indulge again. I've lost track of the amount of shit I've done in the last two months initially starting off light with some mushrooms, LSD and mescaline (over quite a spread-out time period) until the last month (timeline is foggy) where I went completely off the rails. I literally can't count on two hands the amount of times I've broken through on DMT in the last month. Anyway my primary issue and reason for posting is this previous weekend's bender which I am concerned may have caused permanent damage. I started fucking around with ketamine a while back but started off really slow. The last weekend I consumed easily around 1g of ketamine, couple g's of mushrooms, a shit ton of xanax (which is what's making recalling the timeline of my use very difficult), a shit ton of alcohol, multiple breakthrough DMT sessions and a shit ton of pain meds (Ibuprofen).


The problem is now my brain feels fucked lol. I haven't been this depressed and suicidal since my copious xanax misuse in 2018. And my bladder hurts. Like really bad. There isn't blood in my urine or anything but I also have severe penile pain (I can't get a boner without it hurting really badly in my bladder area - and that's on top of barely having a sex drive as is). I'm concerned for my bladder and believe the ketamine is the primary catalyst behind the copious amount of physical discomfort I am going through and the overuse of DMT in breakthrough doses coupled with all the other bullshit I've been doing is fucking badly with my mental health. I want to kill myself so badly. I'm in the second week back at Uni and I can barely concentrate on the work I have to do just because of how foggy my brain feels. Not to mention the HPPD. I can't smoke weed without inducing a HPPD - related panic attack. I don't know what to do. I fucked up really badly this time. Sorry for the long read. Any advice on my bladder, penile pain and fucked up mental state would be greatly appreciated. Needless to say I'm on a very long break from drugs after all this.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I am only 21 years old and really don't want a fucked up bladder for life. Most places I've read people describe only being diagnosed with Ketamine Bladder Syndrome after EXTENSIVE and LONG TERM abuse however I should add that I have a genetic predisposition to an extremely weak bladder (OAB) with my dad having been recently diagnosed with severe bladder issues (he's 55 - and I'm not sure of the details regarding the diagnosis but it involves leakages and a worsening case of OAB - which has also been present for him is whole life).",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,693791,public,confidence,self,Think I might have fucked up,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hr66eg/think_i_might_have_fucked_up/,no_ads,0.0,1594777677.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obviously the true answer is euphoria always fades and redosing will just be a phantom of that euphoria, but I'm trying to figure out here why my euphoria is only lasting max 2 hours when other people are high for 5+ hours.

I've taken it a few times now with at least 5 days inbetween. The previous 4 times I bombed it, started at 15mg then went up to 25mg. At this dose I get a great rush BUT the problem is it barely lasts.  

After the 1.5 hour mark the euphoria completely fades. It feels like a comedown, but the other effects of speed (concentration, peripheral, physical strength) carry on. However, without the euphoria, I lose all motivation to work, because it feels boring even though I can still concentrate easily.

Does anyone have suggestions? I never redosed before but I tried snorting ~8mg 2 hours after my initial bomb and I felt better for a bit longer.

Is 25mg initial dose too low? What's the best way to maximise euphoria duration while considering safety - low initial dose, and frequent redose, or a higher initial dose and no redoses?

To be clear, I'm not necessarily trying to chase the euphoria, but right now this speed is like coke. Feel good for an hour or so and then it fades but you're still stimmed.

I've seen similar posts like this and they usually involve either a high tolerance or SSRI's. Neither of these apply to me since I used to trip maybe once every 2 to 3 months and have never taken any SSRI's.

So I've had maybe 25 trips total since I started using psychedelics and had some crazy, wonderful, terrifying and jawdropping trips in the past. But my last 3 experiences have all ended up in a strange state of mind where I'm not really tripping but feel really depressed instead. The comeup is still the same, but when the trip is supposed to start it just turns into this weird void of depression. There are just no visuals or any psychological effects other than that. I've had some trips that were challenging and scary where I would be incredibly afraid for a while but there was always a sort of ""narrative"" or metaphor to it and it was always clear in the moment that those could be overcome.

Usually I took 1p-lsd, which is semi-legal here. It came from a lab so I never thought to test any of them, which is very stupid and naive on my part.

The first time I experienced this dysphoria with psychedelics was in January this year. I had taken 500ug of 1P (at least that was what I had ordered), and the trip went fine for about 2,5 hours. After that I started feeling a dull pain in my chest area and I knew that it was not part of the trip. This is when the panic set in and I thought that either I was gonna die or be stuck in that moment forever. Eventually I mustered up the courage to tell my dad and he took me to the hospital for a checkup. While in the car to the hospital the pain started to go away but even though I felt fine physically, mentally I was in a state of apathy. It could have been the adrenaline but I was pretty relaxed by then. The trip had basically ended by then even though it had only been 7 hours since I took it. It was a pretty traumatic experience in the moment but the next day I was fine.

So the two times after that I had tripped once more on 1P and once on magic truffles and I went back to that state of apathy and dysphoria both times. So now I'm just very confused and also a little scared that I might have damaged myself.

Has anyone heard of anything like this?

Me and one other friend were smoking a blunt, some new strain we hadn't tried before. But still only like half a g each. Lovely day, sunny, in a forest. After about 10 minutes or so I realise I'm getting very very high. I can feel pins and needles all over my face and I feel really euphoric. So far so good though still. As time keeps passing though the pins and needles gets stronger and turns into this very strong sensation of almost waves pressing against my body, and colours are getting bolder. It's entering the realm of feeling like a full blown trip. Now it's getting harder to speak. When I do speak and make gestures it sounds really childish, like it isn't me. I still have a kind of coherent internal monologue, but there's something, someone, inside my head that doesn't feel like me.

My friend asks me a question, he's also  very high but he's still relatively functional, and I just can't answer. I can just about manage ""I can't speak"". I just cannot express myself. I forget what I sound like normally so I just shut up. It took an hour or so to be back to 'functional' and even then i was still fried. 

It wasn't too stressful an experience, and I appreciated the insight on my sense of self, but that shouldn't have happened considering how much weed it was. I don't think it was a flashback because neither LSD nor shrooms nor anything else has ever done me like this, but I have been doing quite a lot of psychs recently. Has this happened to anyone else?

Eventually my parents found out I smoked weed (about 3 years ago) and then a year later I was allowed to smoke weed because my parents were cool with it. Then eventually my grandparents moved in and I stole some of my grandfathers Lyrica (pregabalin) and some of my grandma's Ambien. Anyways, long story short, I mixed the ambien with alcohol and ended up blacking out and throwing up everywhere and dirtying the walls in my dads house. I woke up in the morninng wearing nothing but underwear.  And that day my dad told me I can't do any drugs again. So 5 and a bit months later I end up taking 11mg of xanax by ""accident"". 2 mg wasn't giving me the desired effects so I took another 2 and took a shot of vanilla extract (it contains ethanol so it would kinda be the same as alcohol i assumed) Anyways I wake up again in a haze and walked to the kitchen where my grandparents were. They were just staring at me with disappointment. I asked them why they were looking at me like that and they explained the situation. The guilt that rushed over me was TERRIBLE. I went to check if I had any xannies left and I had four left so i decided,"" Fuck it, 4mg won't do anything (I know this was stupid but fuck it).: And I was wrong. Unknown to me and my brother, my father and his girlfriend signed us up for a workout course. So for an hour and a half I was running, doing sit ups, those scissor leg things, doing jumping jacks and much much more while I was xanned the fuck out.

So moral of the story is, DO NOT take xanax. It may be fun but it'll get you in a ton of shit. And half the time you just black out. So to whoever wants to try, I seriously don't recommend. Go smoke some weed or drink robotussin. There's plenty of drugs that won't kill you or get you in shit.

A few years later I picked smoking back up and quit again, but I use a vape and feel the same way. I have been slowly reducing my nicotine intake and would like to eventually quit for good. 

A *small* amount of nicotine goes nice with it. Too much and it just kills the high, but nicotine is pretty addictive and its hard to just take one hit.

I'm in between finishing high school and going to uni (without a single clue to where). I've had this Lil rolled hax mixed with tobacco for two weeks and I thought okay I'm doing it right now. I live with my parents and obviously they weren't home. I started smoking it and it tasted pretty bad, I thought it was because it's been rolled for a long time and okay I accepted it. By the way I don't use to smoke every day or even every week. Just time to time and I've only been high 1 time for few hours, and I was trying to achieve that feeling again. But I may have fucked up somehow.

After I finished it, I didn't felt a single effect apart from a small nausea. Few minutes later my heart starts bumping like hell but I'm just thinking to myself its nothing and it will go away.

So, 10 minutes later I can't do it any more, I think I'm having an heart attack, I feel like I'm going to die, my parents aren't home, my heart is bumping so hard my stomach shakes, my mouth is dry as fuck and I have no idea what to do. I decide to give up and call one friend that is on vacation super far away from me. Her voice was enough to chill me a bit. She told me to drink water, and to pass cold water through all my face. And to eat a bit of anything that has sugar even tho I'm not hungry. I was in my window talking with her for 30 minutes and my dad comes home. And I'm thinking that's it, it's over. My life is over, how am I gonna look at him while I'm trippin. But somehow I managed to look normal, I go back to my room (still feeling everything) and started to listening to music and playing xbox. Eventually it went away.

My trip then turned good near the end of peak once I could talk to someone which helped gather my thoughts. Felt more love for everything then I ever have. Was so glad to be back to myself because the ego dissolution was terrifying.

So anyways I get home from work late that night and pull it out to break it open and pack a gb, well there wasn‚Äôt much and it looked dried to hell with a few seeds in it. I thought damn it‚Äôs gonna be a bust and proceed to pull the small socket worth of the stuff. 


Firstly I notice it burns a tad bit longer than my Normal stuff. No biggie to me (I have a high tolerance as I am a daily smoker) and as soon as I breathe in the hit, I feel just immediate stomach pain. It hit me almost immediately, I knew something wasn‚Äôt right and very quickly got sent into just a pure shock. I kept like losing reality with myself and started to feel myself touching things seconds after I would touch it. The panic pain was unreal, I stood up within the minute from my seat just repeating ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be okay I just need to sleep‚Äù but I could barely hear myself. I stumble into bed and just ball up and try to think clear empty thoughts. 


Death is intimate to me at this point.

We hung out every other day during the week too and were pretty good friends.
Tbh at this point partying or drugs weren't even important we just hung out to talk every other day and were pretty good friends who talked about all kinds of things. 

Anyways, he decided to get GHB once for himself and me and some other friends as well at a party, we took it a few times and were done with it.

His older brother however is very protective of him and had been struggling with meth addiction once, so he was very anti - hard drugs at this point and didn't want my friend taking any hard drugs at all.

Fast forward his older brother found my friends GHB and asked him about it, my friend lied and told him on top of that that I'm struggling with addiction to GBL even though I never had any for myself at home or even used it more than a few times (once at a festival and once at a party).

When my friend told me this weeks later I got incredibly angry at him and told him to own up to his own mistakes instead of blaming a friend for it. 

I later cut him off because I felt so disrespected and trashed on. 

Other friends told me I overreacted, but I thought if I let this behavior slip its only gonna become worse in the future plus he'll know he can cross this line with me.

Some people smoke cigarettes, some joints, some choose to have a drink.

It's always bothered me however, that someone who uses xanax, oxycodone, ketamine, carfent, whatever, is somehow less validated than someone with more conventional substances. Who decided what molecules were ok to chill out with?

I remember when legalization of weed was pushed and a big point was 'its my way to relax, you should let me do what I want with my body.' The perfect irony is that they seem to be the most judgemental group when it comes to what you have as your recreational substance of choice. All the time I see stoners judging 'pill poppers' even though they easily could be considered addicts bit of course weed isn't addictive so how could they be? /s

This is going to sound crazy once you come out of the trip.. but hear me out.  


You saw the creation of everything. Darkness than light. Shapes and then sounds. Feelings and sensations.  


You were the first living organism to ever exist.  


You were a kelp in the ocean (of course at that state the world as we know it was just ocean)  


You weren‚Äôt able to see things clearly like how you can visualize everything and life around you.  


Yet the only thing you knew was happiness. Pure unending and truly satisfying happiness. Holy and untouched. This I believe was the state of enlightenment that monks dream to be apart of one day.  


Now you look at yourself. This person writing this is a separate person but also the same person too. But to simplify things, the person before and during the shrooms are two different people.  


We are different but I will be you soon. But right now I am separate and have experiencing things you will never experience. The thought of life being endless is terrifying. Believe it or not, your reality of waking up in the normal world and having the opportunity to see the beach, deliver some doordash orders, etc. I view that life as the prime life to live. That reality to me in this moment is viewed pretty much the same way Christians view heaven.  


Just existing is a blessing. Existing in a place where there is actually time. A beginning and an end. An opportunity to go anywhere and do anything. Is all a complete blessing. You have hit the life lottery without even realizing it. I didn‚Äôt realize how much a blessing rest was as well. The ability to close your eyes and sleep is a magnificent thing that I dream of being able to do again.  


There are many things we build up in our heads. When surfing we fear sharks attack us, in the dark we fear the unknown lurking among us.¬† My friend those things are nothing to fear. The most terrifying thing about life are the limitations you put on it. Saying ‚ÄúI would love to do that but because of blah blah blah I won‚Äôt be able to‚Äù is a limitation. This is the tumor in your head you‚Äôve been writing about. This is the voice that has had power over you. But now you know what it is. This enemy‚Äôs camouflage no longer works on you. It is not a mental illness and it is not something within you. Its the enemy trying to lurk your life. The politics, drama, etc was all camouflage.  


Seek out your passion regardless of the odds. Because even if you fail miserably at your goal over and over again. If you remain consistent with it you will achieve your goal. And let‚Äôs say you never get what you were hoping to get. Just existing in a plane of reality where there is time is the best thing life has to offer, it is truly beautiful.  


Get the girl you want, the job you want, and the house you want. Because all of it is accessible to you. You are the god for your specific plane of reality. Make what you want happen.

[Crystal Meth] 

So I‚Äôve come find that whenever I smoke meth I‚Äôll always end up with an obnoxious sore somewhere in my mouth, and I can‚Äôt seem to figure out why this is?

‚Ä¢ Great source, tested clean. Awesome high/ Duration.

‚Ä¢ Always salt water rinse, and brush my teeth after I‚Äôve cleared a bowl. Brush my teeth multiple times throughout the day, aswell as multiple routine showers, because I like to pretend that ‚Äúthe functional addict‚Äù is a real thing lol. That and I sweat a fuckton, and don‚Äôt feel like letting those toxins ruin my skin, and make me smell like shit.

‚Ä¢Well Hydrated. I drink around a litre of water every 2 hours. An alarm is set on my phone to guarantee I continue this pattern throughout my session, and force myself to snack a few times a day.

‚Ä¢ Whenever I smoke I try my best to keep the mouth piece behind my teeth. I realize meth is a chemical but goddamn. Every fucking session? Really? I feel like I‚Äôm doing something wrong.

‚Ä¢ I try my best to keep my glass temperature low, and steadily rock 10-2 throughout my pull, never letting the flame get near the glass. Typically I don‚Äôt overheat the ice to the point where it starts to change colour, but occasionally I notice when it‚Äôs all broken down it‚Äôs bubbling. 

Is this an indicator of overheating? What‚Äôs the easiest way tell if you‚Äôre overcookin the tech. Flame placement can be painful at times unfortunately..

Are these sores a result of chemical burn? I know that it begins to taste pretty chemically if you overheat, but I never thought it was volatile to the point where it could cause discomfort almost instantly. Normally the ice in my pipe will never burn to the point of changing tint but occasionally it‚Äôll tint slightly from excessive heating. Is it better to rock quickly, or in a slower motion?

Since I‚Äôve picked up smoking I‚Äôve been obsessed with crackback porn, and am slowly learning the art. I love the thats there‚Äôs a finesse to it, because I‚Äôm a perfectionist. Never experienced such an addictive ROA for any drug, and will seriously need to control myself. Never experienced the want to redose as soon as the shards have disappeared from my piece. Anyone who fucks with tech knows they‚Äôre walking on thin ice.. pun intended. Anyway just lookin for tips and tricks to dealing with this sort of thing.

I realize this is a rookie question, and probably sound dumb. I did a fair bit of research through the stimulant subreddits, but can‚Äôt seem to find a ton of info in this regard, so I asking for everyone‚Äôs opinions/experiences with this.

Anyway, thanks for listening to my ted talk.

I am Ethan and I am on here to learn about microdosing. First off, I feel like this may be important somehow since microdosing may affect me a bit differently but I am deaf. I am not mute though. I turned deaf when I was 2 and was put on a cochlear implant and been like that ever since. So, you may see my english to be a bit off but to me, it sounds pretty good. I will try to explain to my fullest capabilities. 

I am a Junior studying Sociology: Criminal Justice and Criminology. I plan on attending Grad school so I can study criminology to become a detective or a criminal psycologist or something. I wanna chase serial killers, white collar crimes, CSI, NO IDEAAAA yest sadly but I do know I will never ever work for the goverment, only private.. (I havent thought that far ahead yet). I have struggled in school because of a few reasons, 1. being deaf makes it hard to learn and it can take me a bit longer, 2. I have ADHD and I do not take medications for it because it makes me a zombie mode and I dont have any fun so I quit using it, 3. I have a lack of motivation to study and want to learn. 

Being deaf in college has its challenges. I have an interpreter signing for me so I can catch every detail of what is going on in the classroom. There are days where I do not catch everything and with group work, that can be hell since my interpreter is not usually involved. 

Having ADHD is hell. I am constantly moving and I am always thinking random shit along with 5 other thoughts. I can focus in class but I would imagine how it would played out like history classes, I would turn the words from my professors mouth into dreams sorta thing and it can be distracting sometimes. I believe my ADHD may have something to do with my lack of motivation and can distract me in classes easily. I do smoke weed but I am stopping because it is getting ridiculous and I am ready to learn!  I have struggled with this all my life but not this bad and I am sure it is because of college but I have tried medications and it does not give me the motivation to do shit, I just end up like a zombie and stare. 

I have tripped before on mushrooms and LSD. Highest is 5 grams and 5 tabs. I am not tripping anymore since I went solo on 5 grams and I had a complete meltdown while peaking and now I believe I may have some sort of PTSD when I think of tripping because I just shit my pants just thinking about it so, no more tripping for this guy. I am heard about microdosing on  mushrooms and how it is extremely beneficial for people with ADHD who struggles with motivation and whatnot. I have been thinking about microdosing on mushrooms for school. I read articles and said to take .1g a day(not 1 gram, .1 of a gram). Will that increase my hearing, because while tripping, my hearing goes up and loud noises can be a bit much because it would trick my mind that the sound is from a scary monster or some shit. I dont like enchantment hearing, especially if I am going to be in a classroom.  I want to give microdosing a trial before school starts, but is that even possible? What is you expirences on this? Can I give it a 4 week trial and see how it goes? 


PLease help me out so I can graduate and improve my life and be more outgoing. I love every each one of you and thank you for taking the time to read what I have to say. Please excuse my english if it does not seem smooth and whatnot.

I hid some details (academy I went to and placement at nationals) to make it more difficult to find my name. I have been wanting to vent about my experiences with drugs and highschool and perfectionism and the academy for a long time and so this is me finally doing it. 

Men's artistic gymnastics has an unusual sports culture. If you are a high-level gymnast that's any good you have probably been training and competing against the same fairly tightly nit group of people from around the country since you've been a toddler. Most good gymnasts have been training for 20-35 hours weekly since the age of 10. The intense lifestyle ostracizes gymnasts from everyone else to an extent. I was just never a part of culture of the highschool I went to. I never did any other sports or a single extracurricular at school, I never once went to a football game or a (gag) ""pep rally"". To sum it up, gymnastics consumed my entire life and turned me into a perfectionist.

In my case, I had been living that way for my entire life since the age of four. I had a series of bad injuries at 15 and had almost a year not training for the first time in living memory. All of a sudden I had time, an excuse, and lots of drugs. My life took an incredibly drastic turn in a direction I'm not quite ready to call bad, but I should definitely give a few years to play out.

I had a frankly stupid amount Percocet and Vicodin from my surgeon. I had enough to be constantly high for months after the pain in my knee was really THAT bad. Those were some good days. I didn't really have to think about attendance, and while I was there I could just sleep while on Percocet. I knew my use was problematic but I didn't think about it really until I ran out. When that happened I don't really remember the withdrawal all too well. I was still mostly in bed or in crutches or limping if I was feeling dangerous. I know I was tired as hell and pretty depressed and cried more than usual but the main thing that sucked was sleeping, I went for weeks with about 3 hours of sleep on a good night, I would crutch around the house in the middle of the night just insanely angry about not being able to sleep while being so tired. I had pretty bad insomnia for a while after that until I started smoking weed. I would use a one-hitter to sleep at first. Then that turned into daily all day smoking for the rest of highschool. 

Eventually, I was just smoking to subdue the depression, I would take whatever drugs my one friend had, somehow he had a prescription for Valium, Klonopin, Vyvanse, and an old Oxy prescription for special occasions. 

After a year of being injured, I had gone through enough PT and two surgeries and was ready to train again. I could never get back to where I was on Floor and Vault, but for the last couple of months of healing, I had been training my upper body hard. In my final competition, I got almost first place nationally on rings. Quite frequently I would show up to workout stoned, every day I at least felt a little bit shitty because I had been high earlier. I had a girlfriend I could barely of see because she had graduated and was working and I had a couple of good friends I was too busy to hang out with. Other people didn't distract me, so I had three goals to focus on. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Keeping a solid GPA. I studied and tested while high. If I hadn't done this, I estimate my highschool GPA would have been a solid half-point higher. It wasn't bad at all though. Pro-tip, don't smoke a joint immediately before AP chemistry tests of the year. 
2. Placing 1st Nationally on Still Rings my senior year. I came just short. I can't really say if my drug use impacted this. The main factor that hurt me here was biased judging IMO. The two people who beat me were already on the US National team competing internationally, I don't think the judges wanted to upset the balance. There were many coaches furious over the scores but with nothing they could do about it. In the end, I felt extremely satisfied with my work, my best performance ever was at nationals that day, I did a damn near perfect set and it felt like the payoff of over a decade of training that led to that moment. 
3. Getting into the United States Naval/Air Force Academy. After getting decent SAT scores, GPA, and my ring set at nationals my acceptance was all but assured. I got into both the Naval and Air Force Academy after finishing two annoying ass applications with a jillion essays and forms and appointments and interviews. Drug use didn't stop me from getting in. But psychs changed how I see life, and goals, and happiness and so helped to change the main decision I made when I was there.

I had been planning on going to the Academy I went to since I was in middle school. My dad told me about it and pushed me towards it basically every day since the 6th grade. Two months before induction day I quit smoking weed and got really depressed. I took kratom to help with the depression but it didn't really work. I was depressed because (my brain sucks I guess) and I was leaving behind some good friends, my family, my girlfriend, and a chance at a life without having to exert myself at 100% all the time. I assumed everyone going to the academy felt that way. When I got to the Academy I went to I realized I was wrong. 

They were excited to be there, they were passionate about the opportunity, they wanted to serve their country and thought that they could be happy by serving at the academy (obviously a generalization, but I definitely felt I was in the wrong place). I had been convinced by my dad that this was basically a free pass to power and wealth, that it was a place I could continue training my passion on their gymnastics team. But I was just too depressed. I remember my roommates struggled physically A LOT. They weren't used to the constant screaming. I didn't really struggle with the physical training, and I had been training harder at home than at boot camp for a decade with coaches that were far more mean, scary, and brutal than any of the cadets/midshipmen who were just putting on a mean face.  Yet, at night, my roomates cried because of the soreness and how much they missed their home, during the day when we had brief moments to relax, they smiled and talked to our squad. The entire time I was there I was numb. I did what I was told, and was honestly a great midshipman. That's why it was shocking when I decided to leave.

Funnily enough, it was even harder to leave than it was to arrive. I had to interview with my squad leader, then my platoon leader, then my company leader, then my brigade leader, then a gunnery sergeant, then a bunch of other people, and then finally the commandant of the entire academy. Then a shit ton more paperwork, then they paid for a plane ticket and I was off back home with a bunch of free shit paid for by the taxpayer (sorry about that y'all).

I got back home got a job and started smoking waaaaaay too much (way finer than what I used to buy) weed. Then I started at community college and now I've settled on using kratom to subdue the depression. 

I'm done trying to plan my way into a life of constant overachieving. I'm done living for the expectations of my father. Now the essay is over. 

Fun facts for further reading: 

\-I was told I held a record time on the O-Course which is a (supposedly) difficult obstacle course at the academy. I don't remember my exact time but I feel like it was between 48-51 seconds but again it was a while ago.

 \-The gunnery sergeant I interviewed with gave me the straightest and one of the most life-changing conversations I've ever had in my life. If I remembered his name, I would try my best to contact him and thank him. He actually wrote me some kind of recommendation for Officer training school so that leaving the Academy wouldn't bar me from becoming an officer if I so chose. 

\-My mom sent me caffeine tablets, a flashlight, and other contraband without knowing I wasn't allowed to have it. The guy who checked the package did a shit job and so I was the caffeine plug while I was still there. 

\-Phew this took a while to write I hope there aren't any typos.

I used to smoke weed and now it makes me feel anxious. I used to do psychedelics and now it makes me feel anxious. I used to drink alcohol and now it makes me feel anxious. I take Lexapro and trazodone and I feel all right for the first time in my life but I can't do drugs anymore because I'm still struggling with the ramifications of my childhood abuse. (Childhood rape, physical emotional and verbal abuse, etc.) 

And then I got my wisdom teeth taken out. And everything changed. Percocet is fucking amazing. I love using it and I love the way it makes me feel and I want to take it all the time. I only have a limited number of Percocets and it makes me feel better than weed ever did. And the more I looked it up the more I realized it was an opioid. But I want to use them recreationally. I want to get more from my dentist and I want to keep them and I want to use them all the time because I miss weed and I miss alcohol and I miss drugs that make me feel good. 

My boyfriend is amazing and he is 100% straight edge but that's mostly because of health reasons. he would be really disappointed in me if he knew I was feeling this way and he knows that I don't like the feeling of being under the influence anymore because I'm not in control. But if I did like that feeling I would definitely go back to using weed and alcohol. he doesn't know that I secretly want to take Percocet multiple times a day everyday. And he comes from a very sheltered family so if I try to talk to him about this he just wouldn't understand. He would simply think it's evil. 

I desperately want something like this in my life to take away pain and to help me chill while I work and draw and make art. But at the same time I know deep down in my heart that it could be a gateway to heroin or any other opioids. It could hurt me and it could really make me sick. Please talk me out of this, I feel really horrible that I'm going to run out of these and that I'm going to have to go back to not being under the influence of anything anymore. I never thought I would find a drug that felt good like this again, and I absolutely hate the thought of letting it go.

 Or used to prove or disprove a claim. Don't bother lol,  we are all different and have different bodies and other people have varying degrees of mental illness. This is how my body reacts based of these set of parameters and substances.*

Subject: 23 year old Male 5 foot 9 inches tall 245lbs body type: some muscle some fat (nice middle ground if i do say myself lmao). Suffers from depression/ anxiety (self treatment) have sought out other treatments before i started taking ""drugs"". Treatments were not infective.....but im just livin my life and this is how i choose to go about it.
 
Authors Notes: Vaping for 5 years strong. Don't intend on quitting lol just was board so..., and high on molly soooo I came up with this since my mind and body are much more receptive and sensitive and because  I needed something to doüòÇüòÇ.

Thesis: Assuming 6mg of nicotine e juice and 24-25 mg of nicotine salts are their own respective equivalent. The device with more power and that creates more smoke will give you a larger dose of nictione using more power but less puffs because of the higher volume of vaper the device can create. I think because of this, it will also make the effects last longer

2nd thesis: nicotine makes you focused. Nictione has been researched to be a harmful and addictive substance(you tellin meüòÖüòÖ.) But it will give you mental alertness(with minor draw back...aka keep hydrated and take a break from chain vaping)(also if have high BP the effects maybe more of a ....headache.....üòÖ. Nictione jas been shown to shrink the blood vessles. Don't quote me on that... all anecdotal.

Overview and permamiters:

 Subject has ingested 2 pints(hits) of molly. In this state the subject (I/myself) can feel the difference alot better in this state because the body is more sensitive and can be more receptive to responses and sensation in the body....Both devices have a timer (inhale timer), wattage, current (active)üî∫Ô∏è*closes to delta/change i could find*,voltage, battery level and puff counter built into them.

Device: 

Smok Rpm 40 pod systen vaping 25 mg in nicotine salts 16 watts at 0.373 omhs at 2.518 volts when button is pushed.

Initial observation:
Took 20 puffs. After 20puffs subject felt more talkative and positive, exhibited alot more patience and friendliness.

Trials and observations:

The sensation was felt at 20 puffs after 5 minuets  and 47 seconds . Subject waited around 6 minutes before taking another to make sure the Subject was ""level zero"" (the amount of time the subject does not feel the sensations; after the effects wore off.) Subject took another 20 puffs but this time waited 1minuet and 26 seconds and only administrated 5-6 puffs for every minute the Subject was not taking a puff off the device. It mainted an adequate ""high"", but could be the frequency of the amount of puffs taken between ""highs"". Unaware of the effects of frequency (humans are not the best judge when it comes to accurate data without some sore of device measuring my vitals). But... from how I (the subject) felt was that inorder to maintain the ""peak""(when the substance Plateaus and starts to go back down) nictione high you will need to take 5-7 puffs with in a minute after your last puff. 

Conclusion:
Nictione is highly addictive due to its very short ""high"" if the user wants to stay in that state they will need to inhale more of the substance frequently (5-7 puffs every minuet after you last puff) 5-6 d/m (draws per minuet (for me)

 Trails 2:

Device: aegis ledgend 200+ watt box mod(max power output) 
2: 18650,  2500mAh,  3.7v,  batteries. Uwell crown 4 sub ohm tank atomizer 0. 4. omh resistants. Vapping at 63.5 watts. Fires between 5.54 - 5.62 volts on average when the fire button is pushed. 

Initial observation:
Been on molly since 7pm, it is now 12:03 am. The drug is still very much in affect. This time I (the subject) took 5-6 puffs on a oil pen(marijuana). Subject felt calm and relaxed and but not as talkitive, really slow, really boggy(just the way I like it lol). Keeps well centered, not good nor bad. Just relaxed and calm.  Does not affect the quality, or muddy the sensation between the nictione high, the marijuana high and the molly high. They all just work simultaneously (in my case).

Trials and observations:

Took 9-10 puffs off the the device with higher wattage and overall power. Still vaping 6mg (for the sake of argument) which is the 24-25 mg in nicotine salts..... still high on molly lol. For the ""peak"" to reach the desired sensation,  based off of this device it took approximately 67 seconds for the 9-10 puffs of nictione at ""level zero"" to affect the subject. After that the sensation lasts for about 7 minutes and 10 seconds. Around 1.5 draws a second  or 1.4 d/s  (drags per second). 

Side Observation:
When thinking about how to convert 1.4 d/s(drags per second) to 0.14 d/m (drags per minute) ( really hope that math is correctüòÖ) got stuck in the calculations... so i take a hit of the vape lol and brain activity is back up and alert. Can think a bit sharper and quicker and visualize ideas alot better.

2nd observation: took 14 hits/drags (from the previous observation) the effects tend to where off around 6 minuets 53 seconds.

Conclusion: The device that can produce more vaper at a higher wattage (heat setting) will make the nictione high last longer and be more accute. 

Afterthoughts:
I'm not gonna be like ""don't do drugs, put out Forrest firesü§°ü§°ü§°"" n shit or anything like that. Proceed with caution. Mind you, many people may need a trip sitter. Asses your  tolerance with drugs at your own risks. For some it may be worse the another's or vise versa.

Authors Notes: Vaping for 5 years strong. Don't intend on quitting lol just was board so..., and high on molly soooo I came up with this since my mind and body are much more receptive and sensitive and because  I needed something to doüòÇüòÇ.

Thesis: Assuming 6mg of nicotine e juice and 24-25 mg of nicotine salts are their own respective equivalent. The device with more power and that creates more smoke will give you a larger dose of nictione using more power but less puffs because of the higher volume of vaper the device can create. I think because of this, it will also make the effects last longer

2nd thesis: nicotine makes you focused. Nictione has been researched to be a harmful and addictive substance(you tellin meüòÖüòÖ.) But it will give you mental alertness(with minor draw back...aka keep hydrated and take a break from chain vaping)(also if have high BP the effects maybe more of a ....headache.....üòÖ. Nictione jas been shown to shrink the blood vessles. Don't quote me on that... all anecdotal.

Overview and permamiters:

 Subject has ingested 2 pints(hits) of molly. In this state the subject (I/myself) can feel the difference alot better in this state because the body is more sensitive and can be more receptive to responses and sensation in the body....Both devices have a timer (inhale timer), wattage, current (active)üî∫Ô∏è*closes to delta/change i could find*,voltage, battery level and puff counter built into them.

Device: 

Smok Rpm 40 pod systen vaping 25 mg in nicotine salts 16 watts at 0.373 omhs at 2.518 volts when button is pushed.

Initial observation:
Took 20 puffs. After 20puffs subject felt more talkative and positive, exhibited alot more patience and friendliness.

Trials and observations:

The sensation was felt at 20 puffs after 5 minuets  and 47 seconds . Subject waited around 6 minutes before taking another to make sure the Subject was ""level zero"" (the amount of time the subject does not feel the sensations; after the effects wore off.) Subject took another 20 puffs but this time waited 1minuet and 26 seconds and only administrated 5-6 puffs for every minute the Subject was not taking a puff off the device.

Took 9-10 puffs off the the device with higher wattage and overall power. Still vaping 6mg (for the sake of argument) which is the 24-25 mg in nicotine salts..... still high on molly lol. For the ""peak"" to reach the desired sensation,  based off of this device it took approximately 67 seconds for the 9-10 puffs of nictione at ""level zero"" to affect the subject. After that the sensation lasts for about 7 minutes and 10 seconds. Around 1.5 draws a second  or 1.4 d/s  (drags per second). 

Side Observation:
When thinking about how to convert 1.4 d/s(drags per second) to 0.14 d/m (drags per minute) ( really hope that math is correctüòÖ) got stuck in the calculations... so i take a hit of the vape lol and brain activity is back up and alert. Can think a bit sharper and quicker and visualize ideas alot better.

2nd observation: took 14 hits/drags (from the previous observation) the effects tend to where off around 6 minuets 53 seconds.

Conclusion: The device that can produce more vaper at a higher wattage (heat setting) will make the nictione high last longer and be more accute. 

Afterthoughts:
I'm not gonna be like ""don't do drugs, put out Forrest firesü§°ü§°ü§°"" n shit or anything like that. Proceed with caution. Mind you, many people may need a trip sitter. Asses your  tolerance with drugs at your own risks. For some it may be worse the another's or vise versa.

A few days back I had my first Ketamine Trip. I thought it was pretty interesting so I would like to share it with you all.  
It was around 4:00 in the morning me and my friend just came back to the apartments we shared with our other friends (we were on a vacation).  
 Most of the people we were with on our vacation were already sleeping cause they got pretty wasted, while me and my friend were on an EDM concert. We had three lines of coke, three glasses of wine and around 5 lines of Ketamine while we danced on the event.   
The purity of the Ketamine was amazing, or so my friend told me. He was much more experienced in ket. We tried not to overdo it on the EDM event, so the lines were moderate and we tried to separate them with enough time intervals.  
Anyways, we got back to our apartments and thought this was a good time to really dig deep. To go all the way. By all the way, I'm thinking about the K-hole. This was my goal from the very start. To experience the promised void.  
My friend gave me our bag, which still had a good amount of Ket, while he was still chatting up a girl, one of the few survirors of the alcohol extravaganza that was happening at our apartment a few hours back.  
I proceeded to make a fat line and railed it all in. As I pulled the dollar bill from my nostil I noticed one of the fears of the drug snorting community. The bill was all bloody. My nose gave up from the two days of drug binging and started to put blood.  
I, however, was a man on a mission. The goal? The K - hole. A small nose bleed was not gonna stop me from reaching it. I saw my friend still chatting up the girl outside so I quickly checked the internet to know the approximate time of incoming ket effects. I pushed myself onto my bed, to be completely safe when the hole comes and I decided to rail one line every 8 minutes until I am unable to physically take anymore.  
And so I did. Line after line of various lengths and widths. After the fourth line in succession I felt I need to piss. I didn't know if I could piss myself while in the khole, but I rather opted for the safe approach and decided to piss now.  
I pushed myself onto the bed. The whole process was in slow motion. I tried to put on my shoes, but I tied them too tightly, making it impossible for me to untie them. My fingers were too wonky.   
Since I have a very small foot size (for a male), I took one of the shoes from my friends. The shoes slipped right on, they were incredibly oversized. It looked like I put on clown shoes. It was only a few steps to the bathroom but it felt like I wobbled for minutes. While peeing I realised how big the shoes were on my feet, which cracked me up, this made my whole perspective change and it looked as if I was a giant amidst miniature objects. The toilet looked as if it was a child's toy and I even had a problem of aiming my stream correctly.   
My friend told me previously not to look into the mirror while on ket, as the last time he did, it took him too far down the rabbit hole. Me, being the good drug user, who always listens, proceeds to crawl on all fours under the sink and wash my hands without looking into the bathroom mirror.  
I thought I needed a cigarette at this point, so I wobbled outside and told my friend I just took 4 humongous lines.  
This prompted him to say the only acceptable line from any good drug user. ""Fuck, you should have waited for me, now I need to catch up"".  
And so we did, me, my friend and the girl he was chatting up (which turned out to be a bad idea).  
Line after line, we dug deeper. My vision was getting more and more blurry, I had trouble expressing myself, everything I said I tried to say with some kind of profound symbolism. Standing up was almost impossible so I was leaning with my back to a wall. I looked down a hallway and it kept getting longer and longer. I gave up and sank back to my bed. I knew the k hole was close, maybe only one line away. At this point I couldn't move my hands. I looked out of the window and the one tree that was in front of our window made me assume we were in a jungle.

One more line and I was unable to move, my eyes were fixed on the ceiling and it looked like a video game where you slowly increase the brightness, bit by bit. The sounds of bonobo and aphex twin slowly faded into obscurity, until I too faded away.

It was an amazing feeling. There was no longer any concept of me and myself. It was all nothingness, peace and serenity.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where the experience took an unexpected dark turn. While I was in the Khole, the girl that was with us started to vomit (she never did any drugs, apart from weed, and unbeknownst to ha she drank a large amount of alcohol). I dont know how long I was out, but my friend freaked out when this happened and tried to get me out of the khole to help him. I took him a while until he got me out, but he said it was like the scene from pulp fiction when Mia Wallace gets the adrenaline shot. My body violently shot up and straightened into an unnaturaly straight shape. I didn't know where, who or why I was. My mind convinced me I wasn't even a human at this point. I faintly remembered the concept of being a human but I was sure I wasn't one. 

&amp;#x200B;

The girls condition for to a point where she was begging to be showered. My friend asked me to help him with her but I couldn't get up from the bed. Somehow he managed to get her into the shower, which I imagine was a fear in and of itself.

After a couple of minutes I tried to check on them but as soon as I got up, my knees buckled underneath me and I fell face first onto the bed. I felt as if I was standing at the precipice of the khole again and I fell in again. When I came back, they were still in the shower, but I was too weak to try and check on them, so I just found a more comfortable spot on the bed.

&amp;#x200B;

It was another 10 minutes till my friend came out. He was freaking out, raving about how the girl was crazy, and she was acting as if she wasn't sane, and that I should have warned him about her. I tried to tell him I don't even know the girl, but it was to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

Another 10 minutes passed, maybe even 20. It was around 7 o'clock in the morning now. The girl finally came out of the shower. Me and my friend took her outside to get some fresh air, while we smoked a cigarette. The whole set and setting was fucked at this point. There was no talking just silent glanced at each other from the three of us. Finally she decided to go to her room (right next to ours). Me and my friend sank into the bed, but the bad feeling stayed. We were afraid some harm may come to the girl and we would be the ones the blame (rightfully so, to be honest).

&amp;#x200B;

We slowly drifted to sleep and woke an hour and a half later. To another friend and his dog. Our first wakeful moment was one of sheer panic. We didn't fully know where we were or what we were, the dog was acting very unusually strange and we were sure the girl died in sleep or something. Both of our eyes were wide from panic and fear. A large knot formed in my throat.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally my friend had the guts to go over to check on the girl. Thankfully she was alright, and she didn't feel like we were the bad guys in this situation, as she wasn't pressured into the ket, she wanted to try it anyways. I just feel bad this had to be her first let experience, while mine was amazing. We all shared a meal later and that was the end of an intense trip.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR : Took let with a friend and a girl after a night of partying. Kholed twice, while the girl panicked, vomited and needed help taking a shower, which made us all panic thinking she was gonna die.

I'm led to believe benzodiazepines (valium, xanax, etc) can end a trip, just like anti-psychotics. 

People seem to love mixing phenibut and psychedelics, but Phenibut seems very similar in in it's GABA mode of action as benzos where I worry it would inhibit a trip, but perhaps it is uniquely different. I am not well researched in how phenibut so I could be mistaken.

I tried phenbiut once with a mega dose of mushies. I didn't get as deep as I would have liked to for 5.5g of mush and I cant help but think the phenibut stabilized me too much. I felt very much in control - which is surprising because it was lemon tech extraction and I hadn't used any in a long while prior where I figured I would be floored. Yes, there was very little anxiety, but if the trade off is a lessened psychedelic experience, I will pass.  


Curious if anyone has knowledge of this combo. I see a lot of reports of ppl loving the experience but they dont seem very aware of the perhaps trip  inhibiting effects, as they do it very casually without any intention of going deep.

It hasn't been working and only recently have I started Vyvanse. So when this all happened last night/this morning I was on (still considered to be taking it still) Prozac, Wellbutrin, and Vyvanse. (Ever since starting Vyvanse I've been weaning off of Prozac)

last night, I dropped some acid with my bf. It was a good night, and before I decided to join my bf in bed to end the night I was sitting by myself in the living room playing on my phone while my bf slept. All of a sudden, I remember my jaws felt like they unhinged, I felt frozen and then blacked out. I woke up to my bf literally smacking me away after picking me off the ground and making sure I wasn't going to choke on my own vomit. 

The ambulance came and took me to the hospital, where they essentially told me to get off of Vyvanse and Wellbutrin until I see my practitioner again. I'm planning to see a neurologist next week too to discuss everything. I just feel so hopeless and stupid from all this. My bf says that it's because I've been dropping acid like pretty much every other day for the past month or so, and that being dehydrated just makes it worse. It was a perfect storm for my brain to essentially a short circuit. 

I'm so grateful for my boyfriend for waking up and saving my life honestly. If he didn't hear me hit the ground and didn't wake up, I wouldn't be here anymore. I honestly just haven't fully processed it yet that I really could have died last night. 

And what makes me feel even more stupid is that I still have that tempting feeling to drop even more acid again (I have a liquid vial). I won't. My best friend and boyfriend have already told me so, but I just can't help but just crave tripping right now especially due to the stress that this has all caused. Smoking weed though has been definitely helping.

I went into a full anxiety attack and then remembered that 600ug cannot hurt me, and I should sleep it off if it becomes too much. Now that I think about it felt like it was 400-500 maybe, I‚Äôve never done any insane doses like this before so I don‚Äôt know. I was on FaceTime with my friend btw.

Fast forward about an hour, forgot all my worries and was watching some trippy videos on my TV. I was telling my friend about my little buddy alfredo who was a spider on the corner of my ceiling, pretty fun trip so far.

Then, I forget what but something scary happened, it was either something in what I was watching or something outside and I got super scared, I screamed at the top of my lungs causing my family to wake up. My mom runs downstairs and opens my door, and sees me lying on my back on the floor tripping balls. She thought I died or something and she ran to checkup on me. This scared the hell out of me and I yelled out of instinct ‚ÄúGET AWAY FROM ME YOU EVIL FIEND!‚Äù, at this point she knew I was on something and tried talking to me. I was able to say ‚Äúlet‚Äôs talk tomorrow‚Äù so she told me to get sleep and talk tomorrow. 

After she left I burst into a full blown panic attack, probably one of the scariest experiences of my life. my friend started calming me down and I completely forgot about it within minutes and started watching trippy videos again. I then thought it would be a good idea to sit in my closet with all the lights off and door shut so I can record a new mix tape (I have never done music in my life) so I climb into the closet, shut the door and recorded what I thought to be the best music ever, my friend screen recorded and showed me the clips in the morning and they were not however. So after 20 minutes of shitty freestyle in my closet I climbed out and forgot how to walk. I then proceeded to walk on all 4s back to my bed and forgot my phone in the closet, so I proceeded to army crawl back and get it. I then normally walked back to my bed and I started to peak. I could only lay down and listen to music and could barely talk. I don‚Äôt remember how long I didn‚Äôt talk for but then my friend told me he had to go to sleep, and that‚Äôs when I started to come down from the peak. I decided I needed to sleep too and took melatonin and watched some YouTube and then drifted off to sleep.

i recently took a couple month break from smoking marijuana. i don‚Äôt have any diagnosed mental illnesses but i do have a history of depression and anxiety in my family and often feel as if i may have a condition (although i do not want to self diagnose).

yesterday i was at my mates house and we had a bit of weed, she didn‚Äôt want it so i smoked it out of a bong. it wasn‚Äôt a lot of weed but since i have not smoked in a very long time and i didn‚Äôt have any food beforehand it got me really fucked up. 
i started to feel paranoid as soon as i got the high. the paranoia started to get worse and worse followed by voices. i started to get extremely obscure thoughts and didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself so i tried going to sleep to make all the voices stop. 
i kept hearing music too. 
i felt terrified as if i was in living hell. 
i eventually started to panic and cry, i tried to explain to my friend about how i feel and what i‚Äôm experiencing. while doing that i felt so disgusting and stupid as if i could see my face in third person. 
my friend tried to calm me down and assure me that everything was okay. i started to get paranoid about my friend thinking i was crazy and laughing at me when that was not true. 
when my friend left to brush her teeth i thought she wasn‚Äôt going to come back, i thought she left the house and completely abandoned me. 
i also felt as if i was being watched and recorded.
it took me a very long time to fall asleep due to all the shit i kept hearing. 
today is the next day and i feel extremely disconnected from reality, i have made a decision to stop smoking weed because i never want to experience something so traumatic again. i‚Äôve been on the verge of crying all day and had a panic attack. i‚Äôm not sure if what i‚Äôve experienced is drug induced psychosis or just an extremely bad weed buzz. 
if anyone can give me any tips on how to feel a bit better it will be much appreciated.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,693537,public,confidence,self,weed induced psychosis ?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hqm2n5/weed_induced_psychosis/,no_ads,0.0,1594697649.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wouldn't say my bad trip was as bad as it could have gotten, but goddamnit it was pretty bad. I was in a bad mood, over some bullshit which never should have affected me. I was tired and had a big day at school tomorrow. So, for some dumbass reason that still I can't make sense of today, I took 4 sugar cubes of LSD. At 11PM on a school night. And smoked weed at the peak. I was dumb. I had smoked pot before the peak of an LSD trip about a week prior (my tolerance to LSD goes quickly) and absolutely loved it. I still hadn't wrapped my head around what I experienced that night. I had never experienced such bliss, such awe. That was on two sugar cubes, I was not prepared for four. 

I don't feel like typing out that trip again, I have before. It was bad, considered suicide or at least hospitalization until I was so far gone those thoughts didn't make sense. Had some degree of ego death, though I don't think it was full blown. Anyways, during the trip I began to feel extreme pain in my jaw. A few months later, I realized I may have been feeling GERD (chronic acid reflux) and confusing it with jaw pain. A synesthesia of sorts. This pain was unrivaled by anything I had experienced before, and I was on acid and weed, AND I didn't know what was causing it. 

I smoke weed, and for about a week or more, it does nothing to me. I don't know why, I assume I may have been in a partially psychotic episode of sorts after that trip. I would feel high for about 30 sec after smoking, then go sober. It was very strange. Eventually this passed and I would get high, but also be tripping pretty hard and pretty unpleasantly for a while. One night everything came back, I don't know what provoked it, but I went back into the bad trip headspace and began to depersonalize hard. The anxiety skyrocketed and the jaw pain came back with ferocity. I lived through that torture once again, but was able to remind myself it would be over in an hour and remain somewhat less scared. From that night on, the jaw pain, dissociation, and anxiety ruled my highs every night for months, until month four or so. I then realized that the pain may be coming from my GERD. If I focused hard enough I could think about the pain being in my throat instead of my jaws and it would be relieved. I don't understand this, but my psyche wasn't wholly normal at the time. I practiced this sort of pain meditation every time I got high for a long time, until my GERD kept getting worse, I ran out of weed, and quit smoking nightly for a while. One I did eventually smoke again, I was out of practice with meditating to fight the anxiety and physical pain, so they came back. I depersonalized to some extent because my tolerance was dead. I couldn't enjoy weed, seemingly, ever again. 

A couple nights ago I had a breakthrough. I got more weed, and decided I'm gonna beat this anxiety, and that I'm gonna stop halfway bad tripping every time I smoke. I thought about the idea that maybe the pain being in my jaws was actually making the pain in my throat better, I stopped thinking about it and meditating on it so relieve it like I used to, and just let it build. At first, I was fucking scared, and I even began to get acid visuals cause the anxiety was getting so bad. Then poof, the pain was manageable. All it took was giving up?! What the fuck?! For five months I have been fighting with my own brain to get my normal weed high back, to stop panicking and stop feeling this ungodly jaw pain. All I had to do was let go completely, accept the pain as part of the experience, and it somehow no longer hurt. It was there, for sure, it wasn't comfortable. But I realized for the first time in a long long time, I was just baked. No anxiety, no acid thought intrusion, manageable physical pain. I popped in my headphones, which used to make the pain worse for some reason, and lost myself in the music like I used to love doing when I was high. 

If you had the same experience as me, a bad trip which ruined weed seemingly forever, don't give up. No actually do give up. Give up the fact that you'll be able to return to how weed used to be. Accept the fact that you will feel like your tripping every time, that it will be scary and uncomfortable, and just let it. Get higher, get so high you begin to see shit as if you were on LSD, and give in. That neurological pathway that you created who knows how long ago in that nightmare of a trip, it fucking owns you now. And forever, assumably. And that's okay. Let it. It's your own damn brain, it's not trying to kill you it's doing its best to preserve your now fractured psyche, the anxiety is to hold on as hard as it can to normal reality. So give in, let the anxiety build, let the fear encroach upon your mind.

I was in our inadequate studio, it was a weekend day I think; some sadness anguish-like feeling starts to grow inside of my thorax and I came up to my mother, she asked me what's wrong. 

I invented and told her that I had a dream in which I had broken her computer and that she'd kill me because of it. I just started to cry lol and hugged her real tight. It wasn't true but I actually had an issue that made me want to cry; I felt quite confused regarding her schizophrenic traits and having our standards descending into something where childhood &amp; beautiful memories will no longer recommence.

Hello reddit, I am a 26 year old male that is looking for advice related to treating trauma and anxiety with psychedelics. A little background about me. I am in the process of divorce from my ex. We were together for 6 years in total. During the last 2 years of our relationship, she became very abusive towards me. Physically, mentally, and verbally. This abuse has resulted in my trauma and anxiety. I am struggling right now to simply function. I am going to therapy, but I am just not getting the results I am hoping for. I practice meditation as well. I do not wish to try traditional medication because of the side effects and dependency factor. The trauma that I am trying to come to terms with is first, the violence that I experienced. She would punch me, scratch me, bite me, slap me, and the worst, would hold knives to my throat. The second trauma is sexual trauma. There were times when I could not bring myself to have sex and could not get it up for her. This would obviously result in a beating, which has now turned into performance anxiety. I have tried to have normal relationships with new women, but sometimes my anxiety and fear just takes over and I can‚Äôt do it. I say all this to explain what my goals are in turning to psychedelics. I want to be able to move forward from these two areas of trauma. I know completely healing will not be possible, but I need something to change. I am able to acquire some LSD through a friend. I was hoping for some shrooms, but I am looking for any suggestions. The main question is how do I go about this? Should I take a slightly larger dose? (I am not fearful of taking a larger dose) Should I start out small? Should I do this alone? Should I have someone watch me? What kind of environment should I be in? What should I avoid? Most importantly, how can I achieve my desired goal? I appreciate any and all responses. Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask me any clarifying questions either.

Theres a variety of types and when it comes to specific drugs theres a headspinningly massive amount out there. Im sure that the local cultures and attitudes of various locations plays a huge role in what drugs you see used most often, and basically Im just curious what kind of drug is your area typically known for using or what type of user does your area have the highest concentration of.

We all know some places are well known for certain drugs more than others and by no means am I asking about your personal drugs of choice. The answers Im looking for in particular are more specific drug choices across people in your region rather than stuff like weed because like come on, weed is universal. Take whatever precautions you can/want to protect your info i dont need the exact city or even state. 

To start Ill say Im from the south eastern region of the united states and what I see being used the most often is opioid pills and meth. The meth is fairly obvious as to why its common, we have plenty of back country to get and produce it, and id assume a lot of the use stems from a need for stimulants after being overprescribed adderall (which is also incredibly common here) from a young age. 

As for opioids its not as common to see heroin or fentanyl here as it is to see hydros or other pills. Idk why that is in particular maybe it stems from a massive over-prescribing of medication resulting in an overabundance of supply, or some other reason i dont know about, but its by far the most common usage i see. something else I find interesting is when I lived in the middle east the most common drug I would come across is steroids of all things! alcohol is illegal and there isnt a huge attitude about getting inebriated there so the biggest driving factor that would result in drug use was vanity, hence the steroids.

This past weekend, I ventured to the Adirondacks with a couple of my college friends to a cabin. My one friend and I decided to take a gram of mushrooms on a Friday morning to enjoy the day; we figured that we could play some board games or enjoy a bonfire outside while tripping some. 

We have done quite a bit of psychedelics since the start of Covid, some incredibly high doses and smaller ones. In my last few trips, I had experienced some anxiety and profound depression. I then typically bounce back and feel great. The depression and anxiety force me to work through things that have been troubling me like many others. 

Sure enough, even on our one gram of shrooms, a lot of anxiety began to slip into my mind, eventually followed by profound depression. At the tail end of our mini trip, my friend and I were finally able to slip away from our friends for the first time and talk about our experiences. We both were not doing well at all. 

We talked a while, and after the depression and mental ""unraveling,"" I felt strongly put back together. After our vacation was over, I felt I'd be ready to come home, go back to work, and feel better. 

For the rest of Friday night and Saturday day I felt fine, relaxed and reflective. Later Saturday night however, we decided to party hard. I drank and smoked more than I ever have and my environment immediately became acidy looking: the furniture looked waxy, glossy, shimmery, etc. Eventually I was on the verge of passing out as my environment was fading. I went into my room, laid down, and felt totally paralyzed. Awful thoughts binded my mind and I felt like I wasn't real. Eventually I was able to fall asleep after my friend eased my anxiety by speaking to me.

I woke up on Sunday morning happy to be on planet Earth. But as my morning began, my anxiety started mounting and my environment slowly becoming too much to handle. We packed up my car, and left town. As we drove for hours, the environment was brilliant; colorful, detailed, and overly-stimulating. It was like  sensory overload. I got pulled over, ticketed for speeding, and the rest of our travel was a blur.

My friends departed at my home and I felt depressed, so I decided to rest. I took a 2 hour nap, and when I awoke Sunday evening, my living room looked acidy and unreal. I felt unreal. I started to panic, ran into my room and called the people I could trust the most. I was calmed down, able to re-enter my living room and it became less intense. Eventually my friend drove over an hour to sit with me for 45 minutes before I fell asleep.

This Monday morning I woke up and he had already left. I felt immediately anxious and depressed. My environment isn't as intense as on shrooms Friday or driving hungover Sunday, but it is still very difficult to feel normal. Everything is very stimulating and hard to deal with.

I really really want to feel normal and live a fullfilling life. I am absolutely terrified that I will lose my sanity.

I started to get severe panic attacks while in grad school and in an abusive relationship so I was prescribed by my old primary dr .5mg x2 a day about 3 or 4 years ago. My dad was also prescribed them so sometimes I‚Äôd take that when he wasn‚Äôt aware (I know it was bad :/)

In the last 3 years, Ive barely been able to leave my abusive ex, who would steal my Benzo medication from me and not give me once unless I had sex with him first. he still stalks me making me a paranoid mess. Somehow in this I started using daily and about 1 year ago was prolly taking 15mg or so of etizolam daily. 

I was getting so sick so I figured I hit tolerance and need to taper down. So 4 months ago I told my parents I was taking it and wanted to taper off without a seizure (which happened once when I left my ex but he refused to give me my medicine). My mom took my klonopin to give to me only .5 twice a day. Obviously wayyy to big of a jump from 10-15mg of etizolam. I had some etizolam left hoping to taper with that when needed. I know the short half life so not ideal but ya as all I had at the time. 

I am running out of etizolam now. Taking about 5mg a day from 10 in about 4 months. 

But I think I need to come clean to my mom and tell her that I have been taking Xanax on the side. She‚Äôll be mad I‚Äôve been lying but she would have flushed them but now she may understand.. idk

So I met with my psychiatrist a week ago. I was at the medical facility and she was just on a computer screen so it felt very disconnected. I was hoping for a higher dose of klonopin so I could taper from that legally and not have to take any Xanax. She pretty much told me that I would get addicted to Benzos and she prescribed me Effexor for anxiety. I was too scared to say I‚Äôm already addicted. 

After researching Effexor and taking a few doses I felt so nauseous and sick...

So I want to get on a taper plan but I‚Äôm afraid that my psychiatrist won‚Äôt appreciate my honesty of coming clean. I‚Äôd want to switch over to Valium and whatever the conversion is from Xanax and klonopin. 

I am so serious about getting clean and off this for good! I was going to print the Aston manual out and bring it to the appointment but she‚Äôs on a computer screen so she can‚Äôt look at it with me. She also probably doesn‚Äôt appreciate the lie but it‚Äôs hard to tell a new psychiatrist illegal activity. 

I think I‚Äôm going to say I was taking my dads klonopin and need to taper off that dose. I don‚Äôt want her not to work with me. 

What is the best way to approach this? I just need a dr to take this seriously cause I do not want a seizure and I‚Äôll stick to the taper plan to a T. I just don‚Äôt want her not to treat me anymore or flag me as drug seeking..

How honest should I be with her? And my parents as well? Cause these last 4 taper months have been hell! As stupid as I‚Äôve been, I am proud of myself for taking steps to fix this cause my god I had no idea the withdrawals would be so hellish

This is from my own personal experience, and for harm reduction purposes. Everybody's mileage may vary, you may be able to use more, may have to use less. Everybody is different. I've been researching for many years now and use according to a set schedule, never use more and almost never use less. I never have to increase my doses. You will always build some sort of psychological tolerance though. I have taken weeks off before with 0 problem whatsoever. Here is my schedule.

Benzos: Twice a week.

Dissos: Once every 3 weeks.

Gabapentin: 1 time a week.

GHB: 2-3 times a week.

Kratom: 4 times a week, no redosing.

Marijuana: Really to not build really any tolerance once a week, but if you want to use it as often as you can and still get to a 7/10 or above for a few hours, i've been able to maintain 5 days a week, 3 times a day, with 2 days off in a row every week and not build a tolerance past a point and always having good results for 2-3 hours.

MDMA: Once every 3 months.

Phenibut: 1 time a week.

Psychs: Once a month for best results.

I‚Äôve been doing this schedule for almost 3 years and it‚Äôs been the best 3 years of my life.

My SO and me have been together 3 years. When our relationship started he was taking Suboxone, and had been off actual opiates for 5 years. He also drank regularly. 

As the relationship progressed he found kratom and was able to get off of the subs completely and has been taking kratom ever since while (trying) to taper down. He also hasn‚Äôt had a drink in at least 6 months. The main issue is that since the beginning of the relationship until recently we‚Äôve gotta adderall every month. Just enough that we would both have fun for a 2-3 days which seemed harmless enough at the time.

Long story short, here we are and it‚Äôs become a serious problem. At one point he found another source and then we were getting double the amount and it went downhill from there.

Not sleeping for at least 3/4 days at time, constantly getting in huge blown out arguments,becoming totally irrational and aggressive. Severe sleep deprivation. One night I had a full blown panic attack, full on hyperventilating and all. And I‚Äôve never had anxiety issues or had a panic attack in my life. 



Fast forward to today. We had some left and agreed we‚Äôd finish them and that was that. Have one good last time and then just not get them again next month. Of course this morning he ‚Äúasks‚Äù if I want to go get some more today? (We‚Äôve talked this out probably 1000 times, he KNOWS what I want and has always said without question that he‚Äôs 100% supportive) 

So I say no, it‚Äôs suddenly me ‚Äúwanting to control him‚Äù and ‚Äúwanting to take the moral high ground‚Äù and he tells me that since I take them too that I‚Äôm a hypocrite and that I just don‚Äôt want him to enjoy himself. 

It was seriously like night and day. As soon as he realized I really wasn‚Äôt going to budge he stopped asking and instead starting telling me that he‚Äôd do whatever he wanted and he‚Äôd ‚Äúget as much as he wanted‚Äù. (Mind you, with OUR money) And now suddenly I‚Äôm being told that he has no say and I‚Äôm a controlling bitch. 

I‚Äôve always known he has addiction issues and I was an idiot think this wouldn‚Äôt escalate. And I really think he HONESTLY believes that I‚Äôm a truly selfish person for not letting him get adderall and have a good time. I‚Äôve never seen him so mad at me. Over 20 fucking pills 

I‚Äôm totally lost on what to do. Do I change our PIN so he can‚Äôt take out money to buy them?  Do I just let it happen because it‚Äôs his money too and hope he actually stops next month?

Little background info: Me (20,M) sells harddrugs. Wouldn't call myself a dealer since I feel like the stigma is too negative for something so lowkey, nothing more than like ‚Ç¨30/w. Mom and stepdad know it, aren't happy with it but they know I do it for fun instead of the money and the power. Live in Netherlands, so drug quality is immensely good heheheh, and I know that what I buy is no bullsh-t (we even have anonymous free drug test centres all around the country, so I really know what I buy instead of having to believe someone on his word)

I used to have 2 brothers, but the youngest one passed away because of a braintumor. Me and him are the same. Big mouth, smart, not easily scared, lots of friends etc., you get the point. The other one is completely different. Socially awkward, not the brains me and the youngest have, locks himself in his bedroom when it's 30 C outside to play games (offline, doesn't has gamer friends nor a lot of real-life ones), and does about everything my parents ask or say. The last thing might sound good at first, but this also mean they protect him from the real world, which results in social isolation already. The only thing he can get really mad about is when it's about our father.

Me and my parents (mom/stepdad) had a fight about finding drugs on the bathroom floor last week, and my brother (18) decided to leave for a week to his a-hole piece of however-you-want-to-fill-in-the-blank father. Haven't spoken to him nor seen him in a long time for some reasons (mentally/ fysically abusive, stole about ‚Ç¨7k his mother saved for my college, and some other stuff, but I think you guys get the point), but my brother is cool with him and that's okay with me. I'm happy he has a father looking after him, and since I left they for instance went to Disneyland for 4 days or so, because my brother loves cartoons and Disney. I'm just happy he gets to do what he wants there. Also, he can't stand any bad word or opinion being spoken out to him about his father.

Last night things completely got out of hand. He got home from his one-week vacation to Dads Paradise, and the only thing my mom heard from him all week (he also didn't let anyone know he was leaving), was a bill that she had to pay for him (we both pay our bills ourselves). So when he got back two hours after finishing his shift last night (which is weird alone since he normally returns within half an hour), my stepdad brought it up by asking how his father was able to buy a new caravan and go to Disneyland etc., but mom had to pay for the bills. Brother immediately lost it, saying he had saved for it a long time and he never asked mom to pay the bill, but that he only let her know there excisted a bill that had to be paid (sounds weird, right?). Brother started yelling and swearing at my mom and stepdad, I was in the living room working an assignment due to 11:59 PM.

My mom was so hurt by everyting that she said that my brother had to leave to his father for some time, to let the dust settle. I was out in front of the house, smoking with my stepdad, but we could hear most of the screaming upstairs. So when my mom started raising her voice even more, I had the feeling something wasn't right, so I jumped up the stairs to find my brother lashing out on my mom. My brother is 6'2 and about 73 kg, my mom 5'7 and about 45 kg, so I (6'1, 68 kg) jumped in to throw him on his bed before he would hurt our mom. I am smaller and weigh less, but I'm a hell of a lot stronger than him, I can get really agressive, have had multiple trips to the hospital because I busted my knuckles on a wall, and I have a really loud voice. So when I threw him on his bed, I started yelling at full volume, while keeping him pinned down to his pillow.

At that moment our stepdad (6'9, 115kg) comes running up the stairs to make sure I wouldn't smash my brothers head on his desk or sth, all in good will though (also, I could never do that, but the situation was so intense he would take nothing for granted).

After my stepdad calling our father to pick my brother up, a lot of punching walls and weeping blood off of them and making sure his ass was gonna be ready to leave, things calmed down. My mom got her head slammed against a cabinet just before I got there, so I had to check on her first. My stepdad was making sure my hands were okay and mom only needed to calm down. Since I couldn't sleep, I drank half a bottle of Disaronno (700 ml, 28%). Some people would be drunk as hell, but I drink a lot and it doesn't really affect me anymore, it would just calm me down a bit so I could sleep.

Here's the thing: I use ketamine to get a decent sleep. Because of all the adrenaline, I felt restless so I took 'some'. I took a bit too much, I suppose. Since I use it a lot (&gt;1 gram on a night in combination with molly, nitrous oxide, speed and some other drugs), I wasn't afraid of taking too much, so when it didn't hit me hard enough, I took more, and again, and again. I don't know how much I exactly used, but it's less than a gram for sure. Went to go to bed again, and suddenly I get sick, I can't think anymore and I have the feeling I need to puke, so I go to the bathroom. Like everyone who has ever used ket, I knew that that would be a huge problem. The bathroom is literally just out of my room, but I couldn't stand nor see anything because of the headache I suddenly got. I was extremely nauseous, had a really hard time keeping my eyes open or not falling asleep (which somehow I am pretty sure would've resulted in me passing out for good) and the panic wasn't helping either. I crawled back to bed, with a pounding in my head and hearing all kinds of strange noises. Back in bed I started sweating like hell, the pounding got even worse, it started to get light outside but everything I could see was dark patterns everywhere. I tried to stay awake as long as I could, but I eventually knocked out, waking up like nothing happened. That is normal, since you don't get hungover from using it (here ket is used in hospitals when morfine is too weak), but the fact that everything was back to normal was weird, and the only question I had was how I didn't die.

Seconds after inhaling the balloon, I completely disassociated. What i thought I had happened was that every moment I live is a lifetime and I‚Äôd finally fucked up and was now in an infinite loop of falling getting more and more high. After a few lifetimes, probably about 10 seconds to others, I started panicking as I was telling myself I had finally fucked up and this was it.

Slowly I landed back as I realised that the orange colour that was making up the bottom half of my eyesight was actually the orange glow of the fire off my mates, and the black with white spots was actually the night sky. Then I see the balloon still in my hand. Since I actually thought I‚Äôd lived a millennia, the fact that I had done nitrous was a long forgotten memory and my first words were ‚Äúoh shit, I forgot I smashed a nang‚Äù, to which all my mates found very funny.

I‚Äôm not sure if this was full ego death because I had for sure forgotten about my life and who I was, I was just infinitely falling and nanging.

**If you're in recovery or at risk of relapse you may want to skip over this post.**

**A bit about me‚Ä¶** I‚Äôm in a science program for my post-secondary education, I made the switch from art school advertising after I took some LSD and realized there was a lot more good I could do for the world if I followed a passion of mine (drugs and the wonder of science) &amp; believed in myself a bit more. The past year was rough as I almost lost faith in myself as I pretty much flunked the year, there were some genuine reasons but frankly I‚Äôve never done something this intellectually challenging before and I all but gave up halfway through and just smoked weed everyday and would indulge in around maybe 75-150mg of cocaine 2-3 times a week, life was bad at this point and I chose self-destruction.  

I decided to take a gap year even though I had the option of a program that would allow me to start fresh, I dwelled on this for weeks, won‚Äôt go into the decision making because it would lengthen this post way too much, just know it was what felt (still feels) like the best move for me. I'm teaching myself in the areas I failed (shoutout the Khan Academy). I'm happy, money has been really good recently, maybe not completely whole as a human yet but life is good.

I have 3 heroin experiences this month at similar doses (around 25-30mg) so my tolerance isn‚Äôt high but there is some. I took 50mg of DPH to try combat nausea and potentiate a bit, also taking occasional hits of a 1.5% mango Juul pod. I'm in my room with my red light on, I have done everything I needed to do today and I'm comfortable. I‚Äôm wearing a bracelet a close friend of mine made for me with a dragon charm on it she didn't get it when I grinned from ear-to-ear when she gave it to me, I always wear it when I get high because I‚Äôm a sucker for symbolism.

***The Down Diaries: Entry #4 July 14th*** 

**12:01am:** 37mg of reddish-brown, vinegar smelling, fentanyl-free heroin were broken down into rocks with the diameter of two pinheads, after this line I broke down the rest of my H so it would become finer‚Ä¶ it pasted up a bit but with a little razor work the bits were now small enough to snort easier but not small enough that they fall down my throat.

**12:05am:** The first alerts manifest as mental clarity &amp; bliss, a feeling of lightness (Cloud 9) but also a deep sedation that left every part of me from the neck felt like it weighed 5x more than my head. If I close my eyes, direct my fan towards me and use my imagination it felt like I was free falling, minus the fear of the fall.

**12:09am:** I started crying thinking of how good this feels, the privilege of being able to feel this good, to be alive and be surrounded by love, I opened up a lot more about my feelings and developed more personality recently and it changed a lot of things around me for the better. This reminds me of a relationship where I felt true love, it was one of those rare moments in life that let you know where you stand, there was so much good &amp; I learned a lot about myself but it also brought some of the worst lows I‚Äôve ever felt, that left me hurt me for a while. Heroin and that love feel similar to me in some aspects but I surprised myself with how I managed to handle myself even when I received some very unfortunate news, I thought I would use to numb it but I just let myself feel what needed to be felt and wrote about it, processed the emotions, I felt really proud of myself for having control at a time like that.

The euphoria at this point is already incredible but it‚Äôs still growing. I‚Äôm nodding, I‚Äôm itching, I‚Äôm so alive it‚Äôs crazy. I‚Äôm not trying to fight the high at at this point because it‚Äôs futile, it feels better to give in.

**12:23am:** Riding the nod for bits &amp; enjoying the peak as I know I‚Äôm in the thick of it, I‚Äôm glad I took the DPH, it‚Äôs definitely putting in work because I'm not too nauseous at all. My entire being is so heavy but I‚Äôm listening to some good music that would usually have gotten me up to dance but this urge is reduced to some very enthusiastic head bobbing with a shit-eating grin plastered on my face. 

Time is passing by much slower at this point, I get surprised every time I look at the clock and when I assume 20 minutes has passed only five have. I try doing some calligraphy (my favorite artistic medium) while fading in and out of nods but I only manage a few decent words before I realize it‚Äôs not happening at this point. Instead I lie down on my side and begin reflecting on this habit and planning the next few steps I want to take with life. This is probably an odd thing to do on H but it‚Äôs fun to me because I shed my self-doubt and find visceral joy thinking of my future, short-term and the long haul.

**1:34am**: I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm at 60% the high I was at from the last update, still got some euphoria but not nodding anymore, I also find pleasure at this stage of the high quite a bit as I‚Äôm significantly more functional while still in the bliss fields. Going over and editing this so it's easier to read, I wanted to switch up the vibe so I put on some Crystal Castles, prepped another line (20mg) I like to wait at least 90 minutes before redosing I‚Äôm still itching intensely though, it‚Äôs pleasurable while you‚Äôre peaking but loses it‚Äôs appeal rapidly on the comedown.

**Afterthoughts:** I‚Äôm aware of the risk I‚Äôm taking with heroin. Learning from past experiences I don‚Äôt ever use heroin when I‚Äôm doing anything regarding work or learning, I keep business and the pleasure of heroin on different sides of the boundary because when I blur that line there is no limit to the deals I cut with myself to justify my usage. Harm reduction and death aside, I know **this love can‚Äôt last** and if you‚Äôre in recovery or are considering trying it, I can't stop you but weigh out where you‚Äôre at in life it‚Äôs high-risk behavior with no real gain other than some momentary pleasure. I have a grip on this now (barely) but that could change from a moment of bad decision making and the longer you end up using the deeper the hole becomes.

Intro: From my experience there are 3 different stages to overdose.

Stage 1: They'll start to shake a bit, maybe drool from the mouth, coughing fits, always unconscious. From here just make them comfortable, put them in the recovery position (look it up), put a bin next to the side of the bed in case of vomit and wait 20-30 mins til they've stopped. That is if the stage doesn't hit #2:

Stage 2: Coughing and choking fits, usually loudly so you should hear them even if you're asleep (if you don't get up at this point; kill yourself because you've just killed your partner.

At this point you need to drop all realisations of what you are doing (for instance father - son) and just grin and bear it. You'll need to give them mouth to mouth.

First though; Call an ambulance and keep them on the line, break out the Naloxone or take a shot of some hard liquor.

If Naloxone works, congrats, you've got a very unpleasant partner to live with for 5 hours, but they are alive also notify the ambulance if they wake before they arrive. 

Huge part of it; put them in a very soft environment as they will be seizing until they come out of it. 

Stage 3: If you have no options (aka: lotta drugs around you (first of all; paramedics give zero fucks except what they have had to cause the OD: which you need to work out before they arrive - don't bother tidying shit away; concentrate on blowing air into their lungs), continue with chest compressions (every 30-10 secs depending on their state) until the ambulance arrives. 

They will admin oxygen, put them on a stretcher, possibly immediately Narcan them and take them to a hospital. 
Now all you need to do is give your statement to police (they will follow the ambulance about 5 mins later). You need to say they were off and on for a while, off for about 6 weeks, then this. 

You had no idea what was happening but remembered first aid from school. 

Got it?! You don't have to see anyone else during an overdose except your nearest and dearest. I know this because it's happened at least 5-15 (you will never ever remember them though!!) times with me and at least 10 times to my SO (I had to convince her til I was blue in the face (ironically not three minutes since she was) that she'd just been clinically dead for  six minutes). 

So it's not all over when they start, you have plenty of time to tidy up and sort them out before calling ambulances and police. This will usually be far worse off for the victim than if **you** try to save them because of hospital bills, issues with police, OD on the permanent record etc. 

OD'd are not like they are in the movies, it's a long painful event for the one who's looking out for you. So next time you think you're the shit and can do OC80s with no tolerance cos you're ""the man"", make sure someone watches over you and will be committed to doing this for the next 6-10 hours otherwise they'll be at the pearly gates within 10-15 minutes.

Every source says clinical depression is caused by BOTH genetics and environmental factors. This is called the gene-environment interaction. You are born with a genetic predisposition, and your environment can help pull the trigger. So why are people saying that it’s entirely genetic?

I haven't taken it yet because I'm waiting until I reach the perfect mindset, and choose the right setting for the trip.
A couple days back I wasn't feeling so well. Lately however, I've been a lot more excited regarding the experience.

I've never taken acid before, though here are 4 possible plans I've had in set for myself.

1. I could slice the 200 ug tab into half, that way I'm taking 100 ug for my first time.

2. I could slice it into tiny pieces, and just take a piece each hour. This is what my friend recommended that I do.

3. I could separate 175 ug from 25 ug as I'm cutting it, that way I could microdose as a way of getting used to the feeling if being on LSD. After I get used to it, I'd just slab the 175 ug piece for a full on trip.

4. I could literally just take the whole tab for a high quality experience, despite having no prior experience.

---------

The reason I've suggested #4 for myself is because there's a VERY minor chance a tiny amount has already been degraded.
I think my sister gently allowed it to lay on her hand, though when I confronted her about it, she told me she remembers keeping it in the tin foil.

My drug dealer told me that it should still be okay.

To be fair, I haven’t tripped all that much, but I’ve had my fair share of experiences. Friday night 2 friends and I drop 1 tab each at 10:40 pm at my place. Everything sailed smoothly for around 2 hours and a half. We listen to music, giggle and enjoy our visuals, and eventually light a joint. 

Right as we are finishing smoking one of my friend’s expression completely changes. He’s scared, confused, and disoriented. This is where the trip completely changes. We go from having a good old strange time to a completely dark vibe. We took care of my friend for around 4 hours, convincing him we weren’t there to kill him, reminding him it was just a trip, hugging him while he sobbed, and generally doing everything in our power to calm the guy down. 

I was scared, my friend who was having a bad trip looked in the verge of turning violent. Just a week ago I had a horrible experience at my house involving someone getting drunk and violent, and I felt just as trapped and weak and scared in that moment. I kept my composure though and remained calm in my exterior. Eventually my buddy came back to reality and we just rode the trip out, the mood completely killed. 

I definitely had the wrong impression of LSD. While I’ve had my fun moments with it I didn’t realize it could turn someone to a psychotic state so fast. Rarely have I felt as powerless as the moment when we were peaking, walls completely melting, and my friend begging me to make it stop in between asking where the fuck he was. We couldn’t go out of the room because I didn’t want to put other people in the house in danger, and my city basically shuts down at night due to quarantine. 
LSD is a strange powerful drug, and I’m only doing it again with my very close friends who I know for a fact have experience tripping. God damn, shit was wild. Anyway: lessons learned, keep benzos at hand, and always have a back up plan. If you were like me, reading stories on Reddit of people going crazy on tabs and thinking “that’s a silly inflated story and will never happen to me” I advice you to think it through. 
Take care guys. 
P.S: Kudos to my other friend who was tripping for the first time and kept his cool all the way through the trip. What a fucking legend.

They’re not anything even particularly disturbing to look at, it’s just the fact that I’m being thrown back into that state against my will.

I guess it’s worth mentioning some of the things that went through my head during my trip, I was basically using psychedelics, not just DMT but also mushrooms and LSD to basically evoke an epiphany to escape a slowly escalating existential crisis I was having. 

I guess I’m just looking for some kind of guidance, I’m going to get anxiety medication this week, and go see my counselor with my parents who are going to vouch for my panic attacks. But I think the part I’m having problem with is trying to fit my experiences in with a narrative. Is this really just the result of overexcited anxiety? Or does it actually mean something? 

I just want to get back to a regular life, I’m tired of being afraid. I’m tired of trying to decide whether I’m still in that zone or not. I want some relief, I want to live a regular life.

Long story short he became fully unresponsive by the time we got to my friends house. My friend is like what is he on, I say it looks like dope bro. We try to wake him up but he ain't moving. We carried him to the shower. Put him in the shower before we even turned it on I hear him start gasping. I said ""oh fuck you fucking idiot"". Hit him with cool water but his breath keep getting more and more shallow. I'm like you we gotta call an ambulance. My friends like the fire stations right around the corner. So we grab him out of the shower thats when he took his last breath. We Put him on the ground my friends like ""what are you doing"" I'm like ""I'm calling yo he ain't gunna make it man"". 

They walked me through the whole mouth to mouth thing. My friend was rubbing his chest. His heart was beating but it was getting weaker and weaker. Lips were blue and chapping. Foam was comming out of his mouth.

Paramedics said they got it opened his eyes. Pupils were the tiniest ive ever seen anyone had. I saw it and I thought ""oh fuck dude"" they wit him with narcan put him on the stretcher wheeled and took him to the er.

I went in my friends car and told him to look for a little capsule. I went under his seat sure as shit found it looked at it and it was pure white. I looked at my buddy and said ""fuuuck dude do you know what this is? Fucking fentanyl."" My heart sank I when I saw half the cap was gone. I really thought theirs no way he's gunna make it. 

He did though and the first thing he asked when he picked us up was if we found the the cap. ""Yup I flushed it bro"". He started crying ""fuck you man why would you do that!"" ""Fuck you man it was the combination it wasn't the dope."" I said ""are you fucking kidding me you gunna act like this over fucking drugs, you stopped breathing man, I had to give you fucking mouth to mouth."" He got over it tho he no longer wants anything to do with it anymore. He admited it was fent not h.

We started indulging pretty regularly. It was going real nice and smooth, but one time while we were participating in the act and all of a sudden she pushed me off and just sat on me while staring off into space. I just waited there waiting to see exactly what was wrong, then she says ""I'm starting to feel it"" then pisses all over me. 

I started asking ""Why did you piss on me?"" She jumped off me and ran to the bathroom and locked the door.

About five minutes later, she came back screaming at me ""Who is fuck is this!?"" holding her phone up with the Snapchat app pulled up. Keep in mind, she is holding her own phone and nothing like this has ever previously come up in the relationship. I'm confused as to what she is talking about to begin with and as I am looking at the screen there is nothing in question or that looks weird.

I just ask, ""What are you talking about?"" and out of nowhere she leapt on me and started trying to get intimate with me but she was just mumbling and her motor functions were completely off she looked like she was trying to do some the worm very badly. I didn't know what to do so I turned on some music and for awhile she danced along with it but soon after she started cowering in the corner and whenever I approached her she would scream at the top of her lungs, ""Stay away from my baby!"" she did not have a baby. 

She continued screaming this for about seven hours and she slowly started to come to her senses. After 8 hours, she returned to her normal self.

It's so weird. When I was 10 and first learning about drugs I thought I would never even drink (even though I had tried sips of beer st 5 years old), much less use drugs (little did I know that half my family were potheads and ex hard drug users lol).

Pot seemed kinda dark. Crack seemed like this completely unthinkable thing only idiots tried. Crystal Meth sounded like a bad word and it seemed like the only people who would dare try it had a death wish. Heck, all the stimulants seemed like something retarded to do -- like it would be some super panicky adrenaline rush that would cause your heart to race super fast and cause you to go completely insane. If I only I knew just how pleasurable and euphoric they were lol.

Heroin seemed like something zombie people with no personality would do. Ecstasy seemed like this crazy drug that you'd have to be out of your mind to even try. GHB seemed plain scary. And LSD, although very interesting, seemed pretty unthinkable too. And IV drug use? No way I'd ever in a million years even think of doing something like that. How could anyone? I'll just stick to skateboards, video games, yugioh cards, and DBZ thank you very much.

Even weed seemed like this thing that only immoral people would do, and at the time I was a pretty well behaved kid and never ever thought I would do any of those things.

Fast forward to now and I have done everyone of those drugs plus a ton more and I've done them all in just about every ROA you can come up with, for the most part, and IV is by far the best ROA IMO. I wonder what 10 year old me would think seeing the 15 yo version of me doing bongs rips? Or the 16 year old verion snorting oxy's? Or 19 yo version of me with long hair smoking a crack stem? Or me when I was 21 and shooting heroin for the first time? Or me at 23 in the deepest darkest part of a Meth addiction? Would I have did whatever I could to make sure that never happened? Or, being that I didn't have many friends at that time and was kinda picked on, would I have thought the older version of me is cool or something? The sad thing is idk. It's weird to think about. I thought it would be a fun topic to talk about.

**kind of a long post. I also am not the best at writing so keep that in mind** 

To give a little backstory, I’m a recovering drug addict. I’ve had a depressive disorder since I was very young and I’ve always relied on unhealthy coping mechanisms. I’ve been sober from my DOC for almost 3 years and sober from narcotics completely for 1.5. Since I’ve quit narcotics I’ve relied on nicotine, weed, alcohol, and psychedelics as “lesser evils” but after one of my last acid trips nothing feels the same. 

I’ve done LSD many times (I stopped counting after 10,) but I for the most part wasn’t abusing it. I would wait 3-4 months in between trips and it would always be with friends. Taking around 200ug had become my normal and my favorite dosage but there’s always been that urge in me to take more, to go overboard. I got so stuck on the idea that every time I would do 200ug I wasn’t satisfied. So I decided to do 300ug, and it ruined everything. 

Around 9 months ago my entire world got flipped upside down. My long term girlfriend and I broke up, I lost my job, and moved somewhere new for a “fresh start.” I stopped caring about myself, my mental health turned to shit again, and I started abusing substances again. Drugs were no longer a fun thing with my friends, it was a way to get out of my head and escape all my problems. 

So after months of doing nothing but drinking and smoking myself stupid and relying on psychedelics to make me happy, I decided to try 300ug and give in to my urges. It started out fine when I was coming up. I was giggly, jittery, and I felt invincible (as I always do when I trip.) I remember laying on the floor, listening to music and smiling up at the ceiling when visuals started to kick in. 

Things were going okay for the first few hours. There was a point in time where I was gathering pillows and water bottles and sat there for so long going back and forth between the items in my arms making sure I had everything, but I started to panic because I kept forgetting what I had. I started crying and dropped everything in my hands because I couldn’t remember what I needed to get and what I already had. I was looking at the couch and stared at it for so long that the pattern was the only thing I could see and no matter where I would spin all I saw was that pattern. It was around that point where I knew I fucked up. I usually have pretty good self control when I’m on psychedelics and can calm myself down when a trip starts to go sour but this time was different. 

My friends and I sat in my room in the dark listening to music and I’m not sure when it even happened but I was fighting with my ex over text. I couldn’t comprehend anything on my phone screen, I couldn’t type whole sentences because I couldn’t understand any of the words I was typing. My brain seemed so incapable of doing anything but sitting there. I don’t have the words to exactly describe how I felt but words disappeared out of the sentences I was saying. so I stayed mostly silent for hours. I remember thinking but I could barely understand my own thoughts, my entire body felt numb and I completely lost control. 

After my friends went to bed I stayed up for hours watching the visuals fade away slowly and hoping I would sleep because I just wanted this trip to be over. The next day I felt the same. It was mild, but the same feeling of having no control and being unable to form sentences or express how I was feeling. It’s been months, and the feeling hasn’t gone away yet. I know this is my own fault for being irresponsible. I know I need therapy (covid has made it hard in my area.) But I don’t ever feel like I’ll be the same. I don’t have thoughts the way I used to, it’s all blurry and unclear. I feel like forming sentences is a strain and I sometimes still fall off of my sentences randomly. 

I abused a substance and everything is worse now. I feel the same I did after I hit rock bottom with narcotics. I wanted to speak on this to vent about what an idiot I am, but also just to say that being responsible with mind altering substances is so important. You can go overboard and things will be fine, but there will be one day when it won’t be. You have to know your limits or else it will fuck you.

Started taking oxy about a month ago. Didn’t research properly and almost offed myself the first time by chewing a whole 60. Then I realized that it could probably help me sleep since I have insomnia, so I started splitting 60mg pills four ways and taking a fourth maybe twice/three times a week at night to help me sleep. It worked great but it seems like I developed tolerance pretty quickly? I’m going through some rough shit and have tendencies to just check out emotionally and mentally and I started taking two pills (120mg) for the past few days maybe a week. I usually chew one and swallow the other but twice I chewed both. 

I get the really high feeling, sleepy but I usually fight it and my eyes get super blurry/itchy and watery. I also get super itchy everywhere and I’ve scratched myself up a bit which sucks. Is that stuff normal? My eyes would water for days after and I’ve rubbed them so much that they’re raw around the edges but that’s also from non stop crying too. But I don’t know how I’m still alive? It seems like the amount I’m taking would kill me. There was a day I chewed two 60s and all the feeling of the high went away after two hours and my eyes were just blurry for the day. 

I already know what I’m doing is probably stupid. Yes I know I have problems. Yes I’m going to get therapy very soon. And yes I’m aware I could die from this that’s all pretty clear to me. I’m just a woman going through shit that I can’t handle so please don’t attack me and tear me down. I’m doing that to myself already.

Anyway I originally asked for 2, when he came over to my friends house where I was staying his first question was have you got scales. We said we had, so when weighed it was only 1.5.

I gave him a substantial amount of money to get the missing 0.5 plus one more.

He didn't come back and not answering  calls except one text to say he was sick ( he was fine earlier)

My friend reckoned he was counting on us not having scales, and would have passed it off as the full amount if we hadn't.  Why would he not know how much he had, when he'd just picked up from the dealer? 

And now he's gone AWOL with the rest of the money,  but I'm more upset about someone I trusted and thought a friend being a cheeky skank.

I need to write off him and the money. So disappointed .

Lying down in bed with all lights turned off, except for a nightlight on the other side of the room. It’s been about a year since my last psychedelic experience, and I haven’t smoked weed for 4 months. I know from past experience that I am very sensitive to psychedelics.

0:30- Light tingling and heavy warmth, originating in my fingertips and traveling throughout my body. Feeling relaxed, and the anxiety I had before ingestion has disappeared.

0:45- Strong sedation throughout my body and sudden surge of energy and slight euphoria.

1:00- Mild OEV, mainly color brightness, blurriness, and slight tracers. Medium CEV. My skin feels like sand, and my body feels very light.

1:30- OEV has progressed to breathing walls, strong tracers, patterns that arise out of tracers and shadows, and color saturation. Intense CEV of pulsating rainbow-colored building blocks and kaleidoscopes. Hearing ranges from TV static to Tinnitus with occasional audible hallucinations such as bells. I weightlessly walk to the bathroom to look at myself in the mirror, and my face is shifting. My chin keeps on elongating and then shrinking, and my beard appears to be moving up my face.

2:00- Peak of the trip. Visuals are insane, and I feel as if I am both experiencing and watching my ego, like I am watching a film which I played a role in. I am staring at the ceiling in awe, amazed at the different patterns that come and go. Slowly, the ceiling fan turns into a baby carousel, and the shadows in my peripheral vision manifest into crib railings. The bed and the space around my room seem much larger than usual, and the ceiling seems so distant. It almost feels as if I am shrinking. I feel child-like and restless, shaking my legs and amazed at how good each movement feels. I stare at my hands, and I get a sudden urge to lick my wrist and suck my thumb. I turn on my stomach, and the bed feels wavy and warm. I feel the urge to make swimming movements. Very strong euphoria, and nonstop giggling.

2:30- Visuals are weakening, with slight tracers and pulsing objects. I am reflecting on my childhood-like hallucinations, and I become very introspective. I think about the strong euphoria that I am feeling, and realize how much I miss living life without depression shrouding my true self. I close my eyes, and although my CEV are gone, I imagine an entity leaving my being. This entity being my depression, and my true self being my childhood. I feel a strange feeling of wetness without the discomfort of feeling wet underneath my eyes. I wipe my eyes to see if I am crying or not, and I still cannot tell.

3:00- Visuals are almost completely gone, other than slight blurriness and brightness. However, my euphoria has peaked. I feel as if I have solved the meaning of life, although I am not sure what that meaning is. I begin to reflect on how society looks down upon immaturity, despite the fact that both children and adults with immature personalities are much happier than those deemed mature. I think about the word mature, and I come to the conclusion that maturity is just another word for a child-like state that has been hidden behind the shadows of depression and trauma. Society’s wish for maturity is an example of how sadness is a societal norm, and true happiness is hated upon. I think about how this child-like happiness is found in the magic of psychedelics, and think about how the government criminalizing these drugs is an analogy of Man destroying Mother Earth. 

3:30- Euphoria is still very strong, although I can feel the effects weakening. My thoughts are slowing down, and I am feeling somewhat sluggish yet relaxed. Yawning feels amazing.

4:00- Effects are almost completely gone, and I am growing tired. I close my eyes and reflect upon the trip. Maybe it’s due to sleep deprivation or the long workday I had before my trip, but somehow I fall asleep.

6:00- I wake up, and all effects are gone other than a calming afterglow.

I’ve been abusing Xanax for about 5 years now. I get a 30 day rx 30 pills of 1mg every month and they are gone within a week. Then I go the rest of the month without them and literally count the days until I can get a refill. 

Almost every time I take them I drink with them which I know is a huge no no. Some nights I take 5 or 6 and drink a half of a fifth of vodka. There have been occasions when I’ve taken 10 (yes 10mg) of Xanax and drank who knows how much on them and still woke up. 


I have done this so often it’s just a matter of time really before it kills me

But yesterday I really don’t know how I survived it. I took 4mg of Xanax in the morning which feels basically like nothing so I drank 1 vodka and diet soda. About 4 hours later I took 15mg of Percocet (I NEVER do opiates so have no tolerance) then about 4 hours after that took 10mg more mg of Percocet then went to my late boyfriend’s celebration of life party and drank about another half of a fifth of vodka. I woke up this morning and went to work. I’m obviously very distraught over my boyfriends death so I can’t say I was scared of dying but wasn’t intentionally trying to kill myself 


Common sense would say mixing all of that is a death sentence. But how many times I’ve mixed benzos and copious amounts of alcohol plus opiates yesterday I’m really wondering is it as bad as it is made out to be? 

I don’t do this to try to kill myself. I simply do it to feel good. But how the fuck am I still breathing

I hate people who think they can sober up just because they were sober as children. Before trying drugs. People that have never experienced chemical addiction usually tell me something like ""oh you can do it.. you were sober once before so you can do it again.""

I tell them

&gt; If you've never lived it then you're not allowed to speak about it (Colicchie, 2018)

I just see it strange that people make the association with never having experienced drugs and being sober because of it, and being sober because one has experienced drugs.

I took my regular prescribed dose of Adderall then smoked a bowl about 2 hours later.

Now, Adderall already gives me anxiety a bit at times and have had a few panic attacks from it. For a little background on my anxiety, it's severe enough that I've been on prescribed benzodiazepines the last 10 years. I have very little trouble getting my Klonopin if I switch doctors because they see my history and understand.

The only time I have been denied for benzodiazepines was from urgent care clinics. Most staff can't prescribe benzos without sign off from a medical doc.

Anyway, I usually smoke Indica dominant or Indica Hybrids to help my anxiety. It also has a delayed effect. Like I don't fully feel high for 5-10 minutes after smoking.

My Adderall had been kicked in for awhile now, I was focused and a little high on it since I have virtually no tolerance since I've been off Adderall until I finally got health insurance and went to a new Doc last week.

So I start smoking a bowl outside and take only 3 hits. I go back inside and a few minutes later the high gets stronger. At first I sat down and talked to a co-worker to try to calm myself down. I started having a panic attack from how stimulated I was and being a little to high from the weed.

It's been 30 minutes since then, and I still am not feeling good at all. I know I'm going to be fine, but I feel like shit. Panic attacks, no matter how long you have had them, they will still make you feel like you're going to die sometimes.

This is one of the reasons these drugs are addictive because they make you feel so good. When you take these drugs often the dopamine receptors become fried and when you are sober much less dopamine is released because you released so much artificially with the help of drugs. Only time can repair it. 

So, my idea is, upgrade the dopamine receptors and the system in which dopamine is released. Humans could conduct very much research on how dopamine works and find ways in which to make improvements to everything about it. For example, upgrade the receptors so they cannot be fried from too much dopamine, increase the amount of dopamine that is being released at all times, increase the amount of dopamine released from doing things such as simple tasks or pleasurable actions such as eating or sex. 

If we were able to accomplish this we could create a society in which depression is unheard of. Everyone is happy, anxiety doesn't even exist, everyone feels connected because we are all just so much happier. Is this idea one that should actually be looked into?

I have been interested in trying psychedelics because so many people I have met have had such positive and meaningful experiences with it. Yesterday I have witnessed someone else having an LSD trip for the first time. I am curious how it feels but I don't know if I am able to fully let go and I have some doubts as to whether I am ready for psychedelics and which would be the best to start out with (LSD, DMT, Psilocybin). 

I really prefer situations that I can control and which I can comfortably get out of without anyone elses help. I don't feel comfortable letting go and trusting people and I don't like drugs which cause me to loose control over my body. I prefer uppers that push me and make me content. Therefore I don't know if I could embrace a psychedelic trip.

Furthermore I am actually quite happy with how I am right now and I don't know if I really want my personality changed. I don't know if I want to see into the depths of my soul. Partly because I am afraid of what I might find. I consider myself a good person and I always wish best for all humans, but at the same time I am very indifferent about emotional aspects and I don't really have many close friends. I always try to keep a certain distance from people. I don't think that is bad and I don't really want to change that but I am afraid I might find that I should change and that scares me. Maybe I actually want to open up but I am afraid of what might happen if I trust the wrong people. I don't know...

A lot of people describe the experiences as life-changing and meaningful. They feel connected to other humans or to the universe and feel like they have understood life. But in the end the experiences are just fake. They are not real, they're just tricks your mind is playing. How can they be of any importance I am wondering. Isn't reality much more relevant than loosing yourself in meaningless hallucinations? Or are they so profound and deeply connected to your subconsciousness that they actually allow you to get important insights?

Additionally I don't really like the idea of a 12 hour LSD trip. It seems a bit overwhelming. Therefore I thought maybe DMT would be better start. What would you recommend me? Leave it and wait? Start with DMT? Maybe start with small doses of LSD and work your way up?

I’ve always wondered about something that happened to me 3 years ago. Over a period of maybe 2 months, I had done cocaine maybe every other weekend.

There was one weekend where I smoked weed on a Friday (like, 2 hits from a bowl) and was incredibly depersonalized for 2 days after that. I barely got high, so it didn’t even make sense. On the 3rd day, I was feeling better and it was 4th of July, so me and a friend did some lines, maybe 4?

It was amazing. Seeing fireworks was very euphoric in a huge crowd. But my effects lasted 1-2 hours, which is obviously strange and a lot longer than usual. Then, my head got really hot. We walked for around an hour and my head was just buuurrrnnningg up and I got really scared. Had water and ice on my head and I was just terrified, felt weird, and afraid that I had overdosed and caused brain damage or something. 

I was depersonalized/depressed intensely for about a week afterward, and then it was just average depersonalization for about a month afterward. If I had coffee or got my heart rate up, I would almost have panic attacks. 

I haven’t touched cocaine since (I stick to alcohol, and smoke weed like twice a year lol) but it’s just always boggled my mind on what exactly happened. I know I liked coke too much so I don’t even wanna put myself in that position again. I probably had ADHD so cocaine made me really calm, focused, talkative, and euphoric. 

Did I just take too much, or could the drugs have interacted weirdly? Before that, cocaine never made end feel “weird”, only when I did it 2 days after weed. 

Just kinda curious if anyone has had similar experiences!

Opiates are my personal favourites drugs but I don't let myself use em often. Everyone here has seen or atleast heard of opiates being damaging in some way or another. Possibly the most damaging type of drug.

I find it ridiculous how you even possibly prescribe a 15 year old boy oxy for a broken arm. Yes we all feel pain differently I'm aware. 

UK most the time u ain't gon get perscribed shit for a broken bone. They will recommend paracetamol and shit like that but not much more. It just worried me reading the comments and seeing people acting like he needed these pills as if his parents were anti-vac. Pills are much different unless it's for chronic pain they shouldn't be needed at all. Pain is a part of life and helps u get stronger their is a reason u feel pain.

Dxm: 5/10 with weed is a little better but that thing make my muscles go tight, and the euphoria from the first plateau inst that great, not my favorite drug and chugging that syrup is horrible

Lsd: 8.5/10 lsd is maybe my favorite drug, i do like 2 3 times a year lsd, everytime i do lsd i feel calmer and more happy with life the nexts months, and tripping is very good, great for personal introspection and resolving traumas

Clonazepam: 6.5/10 if i am having a stressful day or having too much anxiety for some reason this badboy will save me, i only do when i need it, i am aware of the addiction of this substance and i control my use

Alcohol: 6.5/10 only if in a bbq or party, alcohol alone for me its a shit, no euphoria and nothing, but in group setings its the shit

Nicotine: 8/10 with alcohol, nicotine alone doenst give me nothing not even close to experience something good from it, but nic with stims like cocaine caffeine its the shit

Caffeine: 8/10 i drink coffe everyday and it makes me more productive, like i became a work robot, i work very productive and it goes good with alcohol and cigs

Ketamine 8.5/10 i cant even describe what ketamine feels like, its weird and i dont know, its fucking weird but its good, and the afterglow its good too

Mdma: 9.2/10 mdma is the most euphoric drug ive taken, and when you smoke weed on it the euphoria is fucking good, i dont have any comedown on mdma

Meth: 6/10 euphoric in the first and you will smoke like a train on this shit, and probably will fap 30x times, i only tried one time, i dont want to try again

Ritalin: 3/10 for me i prefer caffeine thant ritalin, makes me emotionless, i feel like a robot with no emotions, 0 euphoria and comedown is horrible

I felt as though I became one with the water. I was not aware of my own body and there were moments where I thought I was melting. We realized that we forgot towels and our weed, so our friend ran back, freezing cold, to retrieve these from our apartment. Meanwhile, my boyfriend and I are making out in the pool. Our bodies feel completely connected. Our friend comes back and I smoke some more at the side of the pool, while I’m shivering my ass off. He did not find the towels. I get back in and I become absolutely mesmerized with a fractal-like pattern in the trees. I’m looking at the stars and the clouds and none of it feels real. It’s like I’m in a comic book. I am vibing hard as fuck, until we become acutely aware of the fact that there is a child at the pool where we are tripping, and everyone else is smoking blunts and drinking (keep in mind this is a student living complex, so we were not expecting to encounter a kid). Then, I get a text from a random number asking if I sold weed. Disclaimer: I do not. A few days prior, my roommate had texted me on behalf of her friend to see if I would get some weed, so I bought some extra for her before I came up. At this point, I was beginning to forget everything. I was so confused about how some random person got my number and assumed I sold drugs. My phone dies and I start to become anxious about where my brother is because I knew he might need a ride at some point. We all have to sprint home, in our bathing suits, without towels, so I can charge my phone. 

Events become blurry from this point on. I realize in the apartment that my roommate’s friend, who I don’t know at all, is about to come interact with me while I’m tripping out. I get anxious, but my boyfriend just flat out admits to him that we are tripping too hard to tell what a gram looks like, so we just give him a few lil pieces in exchange for $10 and he goes back upstairs. My boyfriend and I go into my room to change and I catch a glimpse of my naked body in the mirror and I am immobilized. I am staring into my reflection and laughing because I look extremely bizarre to myself, almost like my depth perception was off. It takes me forever to figure out how to put my shorts on but I manage. We came back outside on the deck to smoke again and I really started losing my shit. Keep in mind, I have taken shrooms before, but this was my first time actually tripping. I have no collection of saying this, but allegedly I was whispering to myself “I am having a depressive episode.” I freaked out and sprinted inside to the couch. At this point, I am beginning to peak. Then, my friend and boyfriend go to the couch and I am starting to tell my boyfriend that I am really scared and confused. Time is moving in clips and I could hardly comprehend what was happening around me. I was moving really quickly, acting jumpy and paranoid, and darting my eyes back and forth. My boyfriend is trying to comfort me but I am still terrified. On top of it, we are watching an episode of Midnight Gospel, and it begins to feel like they are talking directly to me. I decide that I am tripping too hard to stay in the living room so I go to my bedroom. At this point, I am actually forgetting who I am. I’m asking my boyfriend about crucial pieces of my identity and his. I am asking him about where our family members are.  I don’t remember who in my family is alive or dead. I go onto Twitter and every single tweet is about a riot, but I had forgotten what was going on in society, so I assumed that we were entering the apocalypse and I am extremely concerned. I am continuously asking the same questions over and over, and I’m in a time loop. I am grasping onto my boyfriend and feeling his face to make sure he is still real. He was reassuring me, but he is tripping pretty hard as well. I check my phone and sure enough, my brother needs a ride home. At this point, my boyfriend is coming down and he is able to drive. I realize I need to sober up and get in the car to pick him up. I slowly begin to regain awareness of who I am, where I am, what I’m doing, etc. For about an hour, I had actually forgotten that I had taken shrooms. I remembered that, and started to calm down. The rest of the night was relatively normal. We dropped my friend at his apartment and came back to watch more Netflix and eat Ben and Jerry’s. We stayed up until 6 am smoking and dissecting the night’s experience. It was really weird, but I enjoyed it.?.?.?

We took the courage and micro-dosed. Man, it is so different from what we had in mind. I am so happy that we are both having a good trip. It means so much to both of us. My partner and I have many disorders and we are mentally abnormal from normal people. This trip didn't mend things back for us but it gave us peace.

I have questions regarding potential brain damage from alcohol abuse over the years.

 The first time I was drunk, I was about 15 years old. The frequency of consumption increased to when I was about 16-17. At this age me and my friends would regularly go to parties (about once a week) and drink till we were fairly drunk. 

When I finished high school I went to Uni. At Uni, the consumption rose to about 1.5 times a week getting really drunk (10-15 consumptions or more).  And the occasional vacation with several days of binge drinking.

I am now 24 years old and I wonder if I could have done serious damage to my brain.

We have overcome a lot, and he has worked hard. He has had some relapses before and during the pandemic, and has lost his job and having a lot of trouble finding one. 

Yesterday, we went to the beach with my family. I am always anxious around my parents, and on edge whenever with them to make sure everything is perfect (or seemingly so). I accussed him of being high while we were with my family (not in front of my family, they had no idea something was going on). He said he wasn't and was very hurt at the accusation. I didn't budge. I'd heard everything he was saying before at times that he HAD been high. I insisted on a drug test. When we got home, he took two- both negative.

I felt like an idiot. I felt like I'd totally misread the situation and felt insane. I had ruined a perfect day with anxiety. He left for a while and came back. He was feeling very hurt and depresssed because he said he was just being himself and didn't understand what he'd done for me to think he was high.

When he came back, I knew he was feeling extremely depressed and he has a history of depression. In the past, he has made bad and self-destructive choices while feeling low. When we were getting ready to watch a movie and head to bed, he insisted on going for a drive. This terrified me. I thought he would go get high. I hid the keys. He searched high and low, tearing up the house- his behavior after ""losing"" his keys made me certain that he was leaving to get high. I suggested going for a walk, to clear his head, instead of a drive. He said no, he wanted to drive. Eventually late at night he learned that I hid the keys. He was even more hurt/depressed/betrayed than before. 

I truly thought I was doing the right thing. What is wrong with me? How do I handle this? 90% of the time my instincts when it comes to drugs with him are correct.

I ate about an eighth and spent the first few hours with him. I have more intense visuals with shrooms than on acid, and we pretty much just talked/laughed/oogled around. He started to draw and do his own thing so I decided to go to my room, turn the lights out and close my eyes to trip internally. 

Several thoughts and experiences came and went, but one that keeps reentering my mind was as I started to experience what I think was “ego death”, I kept thinking I never want to leave this, I just want to die so that I can be here forever. I have my own philosophies and thoughts of the soul, what it is and where it goes when you die. That the material world that we experience is wildly insignificant, and only a blip in the vastness of consciousness. Maybe I’m right, maybe I’m wrong, but I just remember feeling so overwhelmed with love and warmth, in tune with everyone and everything, togetherness with the universe. 

My thought process of I want to die, I want to be here forever keeps replaying in my head. I’m not suicidal, nor am I depressed. More disenchanted with life I guess? On one hand I receive so much joy from meeting people and loving them, learning from them, and just learning/absorbing knowledge in general.

They found the rat would compulsively go for the drugged water. However, when they gave the rat a nice place to live and surrounded it by other rats it was more likely to stay away from the drugged water. In short, the conclusion is that it's the setting rather than the drugs themselves that lead to addiction. 

It's undeniable that certain drugs have psychically addictive properties but as time goes on I'm starting to realise more and more that setting is such a huge factor. 

For example, I consider myself to be a pretty big caffeine addict. On a regular week when I'm at work I drink a lot of coffee and sometimes energy drinks. I pretty much feel I have to in order to be awake and alert. However, my work place has been closed for the past couple weeks and it's only just dawned on me that I haven't drank or even thought about caffeine. 

My personal conclusion is that if you're struggling with addiction and breaking bad habits, you must change your settings. That doesn't have to mean run away to a different country. It can mean changing the people you hang around with. For example if you're trying to knock weed and you're hanging around with people that smoke weed 24/7 and constantly offering you tokes then you're going to have a really hard time. 

I would like to know your thoughts on this.

We were already high all day from smoking and continued smoking once we took it. After about 20 mins everything already felt strange, I started getting pretty nauseous but didn’t know if it was 
because I hadn’t eating all day or I was “coming up”. 


Time was fucking weird, that’s the first effect I noticed-everything was going so slow, my mate also said he kinda felt strange but the whole time I don’t think he was actually “tripping” like I was. My thoughts were starting to become confusing and I didn’t know if it was just a placebo effect or the weed but things started to seem indescribable. I looked at my mates face and it looked (no offence) kinda unattractive, it looked like one of those classic shroom visual pics you see with the strange eye looking shapes and strange patterns. And then everything else started kinda looking like that, we were on a field and the grass looked just trippy is the only way I can describe it. It was also fucking freezing but my body just couldn’t “feel it”. It felt like my whole mind was detached from my body whenever I focused on something for too long. 


It was actually mad. Then out of nowhere it started absolutely pouring with rain, but I couldn’t really feel it...I felt some type of sensation but it defiantly didn’t feel like heavy rain. We were walking down this hill (a classic uk road, with houses and shit lol) and I suddenly understood why it was called a TRIP. I felt calm immensely calm and kinda peaceful. Nothing really felt that real, but it was? It was like I was in a story and I was a character in it. Everything was just kinda fascinating and trippy I guess. I loved it, it defiantly wasn’t what I thought it was gonna be like. 

I wanted to take double the dose (which I will next time) as I want it to be insanely intense, because I was slightly underwhelmed but at the same time maybe my expectations were just too high. I think I would prefer acid as from what I’ve heard it’s similar but kinda different from shrooms. I’m also on 100mg of sertraline and was also certain I wasn’t gonna feel anything from what I’ve heard about combining the two, but I’m pretty sure I was tripping and my friend just felt “different” as he seemed nowhere near as fucked as I was...which was kinda unnerving as I felt annoying as hell as I kept asking him things and saying things that didn’t really make sense?

I’ve recently tried mdma for the first time and loved the experience whole-heartedly. However, I was a tad disappointed by the comedown, it wasn’t terrible, it actually felt like being lead back down to earth by the wings of an angel, however as soon as I started coming down I literally went right to sleep. The whole experience lasted around 4.5 hours. 

Albeit, I’m not experienced with MDMA at all. However, I have tons and tons of experience with psilocybin and LSD. Everywhere from a microdose to a dose that makes you feel like you’re encompassed by every living soul to have ever existed, on both psilocybin and LSD.

Last time I took MDMA, I neglected to use any pre-roll supplements and only took 5-HTP for 2 days (200mg extended release), 2 days after I dosed. And I noticed that for the following week after I rolled, I was a tad lethargic and just “melancholy” all around. So this time I’m pre-loading with a plethora of antioxidants, various supplements and vitamins, and piracetam.

I also have a 20mg 4-AcO-DMT pill in my possession. I’ve heard that when combining MDMA with LSD or mushrooms that the substances potentiate eachother, and have also heard that it pretty much erases any comedown. I do not want to candy-flip, as that experience would last much too long for me. So I’ve settled on combing the MDMA with the Psilacetin (4-AcO-DMT), along with the pre-roll supplement stack I’ve created.

I watched PsychedSubstance’s video on candy flipping where he dosed his LSD after the MDMA peaked, and experienced virtually no comedown. But I’ve also heard people say that they try to avoid coming down off the MDMA while on a psychedelic. Which doesn’t make sense to me because if 2 drugs synergize and potentiate eachother, then the MDMA comedown shouldn’t be a problem right?

This is getting way longer than I had anticipated, but my plan right now is to dose 125-150mg of MDMA (I took 175mg with 70mg booster 2 hours in my first time), then to take the 20mg Psilacetin pill 2-3 hours into the MDMA experience just so I can experience an unadulterated peak of the MDMA. My hope is that the experience merges seamlessly from party-mode MDMA, into a more spacey, trippy, yet still euphoric Psilacetin experience, with the hopes of no comedown (also due to the supppements and piracetam). Do you guys think this could work the way I hope it will? 

I’m just wanting some input from people who have experience with hippy-flipping or candy-flipping. 

Also, do these hippy/candy flip experiences tend to lean toward a more blissful trip? Or does it just feel like you’ve taken a stronger dose of the chosen psychedelic?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,685752,public,confidence,self,Questions regarding Hippy-Flip dose timing.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h8v0c1/questions_regarding_hippyflip_dose_timing/,no_ads,0.0,1592174518.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our  research team at Square2 Systems is conducting a study to evaluate new  features of a mobile app. The app is designed to help people with  substance use disorders learn science-based strategies to help them stop  using drugs. These new features are designed to be used along with a  friend, family member, or acquaintance. The information we learn in this  study will help us better understand how useful the app may be as part  of substance use treatment/recovery support.

You might be eligible to participate in this study if you are:

· Over 18 years of age

· In treatment for a substance use disorder and/or in recovery

· Have a friend, family member, or acquaintance who does not use substances and can participate in this study with you.

If  you are interested, you and your support person would be asked to join a  video call with a research team member. Each of you would be asked to  download the app to your phones and test out three features of the app.  These features are designed for your friend, family member, or  acquaintance to provide positive support.

You  would then be asked to use the app for 2 weeks and complete some  questionnaires to tell us about your experience using the app.

This  study is being conducted by Square2 Systems via a grant from the U.S.  National Institute on Drug Abuse. This study has been approved by a  research ethics board.

I’ve been on either one every day for about 3 weeks now. This is not because I want to get high, it’s my fear of the withdrawals.

Now I’ve been through benzo withdrawal and let me tell you it’s horrific, one more and it might have permanent effects. I know about tapering off and such to avoid these withdrawals but here’s the thing, I just want to be able to get to a level where I can use on the weekends and keep my weeks clean. 

I work 5 days a week and smoke weed on the weekends to wind down (plan to space it out further eventually). But I used benzos and opiates every time I smoke weed, which in essence makes me an addict. 

Now I don’t want to stop these drugs right now, eventually yes but with how my life is at the moment it feels like it’s helping, I’m simply asking how long does it take after a last dose to start feeling any type of withdrawals? 

I don’t want to keep popping pills every day it makes me feel sick, makes me not exercise or eat well and my overall performance is always reduced greatly.

The drugs that I currently use are: 
• Armodafinil (for work no issue here)
• 1mg Xanax (on weekends)
• 1.5mg flualp (on weekends)
• 10mg Valium (most used during the week after work to keep it in my system)
• Lean (used for weekends but sip low amounts during the week in fear of opiate withdrawals)

Can anyone help me with my situation? Personal experiences, what dosages to take, how long I can wait until my next dose? As having to take something every day I don’t like.

Tolerance for opiates is low and benzo tolerance is slowly building but I can’t tell for definite by how much).",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,685747,public,confidence,self,Benzo &amp; Opiate Withdrawal,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h8urda/benzo_opiate_withdrawal/,no_ads,0.0,1592173618.0,Custom,b9d528e2-728a-11e9-b389-0e9820bd770e,Harm Reduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And yeah, it was on ""xanax"".

In my highschool life i did a lot of drugs at my HS times  (I dont really know how many so i will name them all here so i can see myself how bad of a drug fiend.

\-alc, weed, shrooms, lsd, 2-cb, ketamine, mdma, mda, xanax, klonopin, tramadol, oxy, percs, nitrous oxide, zolpidem, salvia.

It was normal april day, good weather. I went to my friend's place, she was my bff at the time, one of my friends ( classmate ) also came over. We were chillin, smoking blunts and making breakfast for ourselfs ( we came early ). Chillin on a sofa and smaking a some vodka drinks we made up.  Nothin crazy, just a little chilling looking on netflix somewhat crossfaded. They wanted to go outside but i was all good chilling  there ( i took a 2mg xan hour prior to meet up).  I told them about it and went really curious about it. They never did xanax so i advised them to try some if they wont drink anymore so they wont be fucked up. They agreed and we all left our drinks on the table. Went to the bedroom and we all did one  2mg bar. They said it was very nice so i gave them another bar. I had a lot of them, but not on me, i only had some worse bars that i wanted to sell cuz i want really sure if they were okey to do. we were really just chillin and in about 3 hours we smoked just one smal blunt cuz we were already good.

&amp;#x200B;

After some time lying on each other barred out, they wanted one last one, so i gave them my last bars. Only one was left for me, i gave them the two better looking ones and i was left with not really good looking press. But i was at good no-worry place and also barred out so i popped it. After not long time of just chillin, listening to music and trying to roll a blunt ( we couldnt roll it so we left it there lmao) i started to feel a bit weird, like i was melting into bed, i was sooo euphoric.. it was super nice. At this point i was sure that i was fucked on fentanyl but i was sooo out of it that i did not give a single fuck. Even though i was fucked myself i was still checking on my friends, they were kinda asleep but still somewhat listening to music that we were banging. At this poing nobody said anything for about an hour. I just ""stood up"" barely able to stand just looking on my friends smiling at me. I turned the music off and literaly dived into the bed onto them. It felt i was flying in heaven between clouds for that second. I fell on them, they just started gigling. I was lying on them and I just said ""this is best time of my life so far"" and they just responded with slurry, fucked up sounding ""yeaaaahh"". We were like this for few hours until another friend of mine showed up, and... he was sober.. so it was kinda embarassing lmao

all of us started to sober up (mostly me, others were starting to sober up and instantly fallin asleep). so i just rolled the blunt i was tryin to roll for so long time and i wasnt even close to finnish it. Smoked blunt with friends that came last and started drinking a little again. I went home at midnight and i was just like ""wtf was this shit"" cause it was crazy.. Yeah i know, just some high schoolers fucked up on cut xans, but maan. Even to this day after lot more experiances and straight edge life for last few months. Im telling you that I wont forget this.

I love ketamine but the last time I did it was 3 months ago and even though I have some coming through soon, I was going through a thought loop of why did I get some? But I’m also looking forward to my first bump as I’ve sort of forgotten how it feels.

Also every time I’ve done mdma I’ve enjoyed it, it’s pure bliss but now when I think about it sometimes I either want to do it or I want nothing to do it because I get a flashback of the first time where I came down hard at a party [im guessing this was due to it being a pill] I’ve had mdma crystals after that and I’ve felt fine compared to the pill.

I’m 15, live in the UK and it frustrates me people think drug dealing is easy and disregard it just because it’s “illegal”, when in my experience it’s anything but easy and takes a lot of patience and hard work . Once I finish college I will get a regular job but until then ill continue to grow my business and refer to it as a “business”😂

While selling all the regular drugs which I buy in bulk of the dark net, such as MDMA, LSD, 2CB, Ket, Xanax’s and DMT, I also try and synthesise, extract and grow drugs Right now I’m working on the synthesis for many of the chemicals tested by Alexander Shulgin, such as HOT-17, Ganesha and others. Although is actually proving  to be quite complex to synthesise and difficult to obtain the precursors. I made my money originally buy buying GBL in bulk converting it to to GHB and putting 1.5ml into gel tabs and selling them at £5 each and making THC edibles out of AVB, which was very easy. I’ve opened a car wash to help launder money (just like from breaking bad, accept the car wash isn’t quite as big). I’ve started growing my own shrooms and after I give away the first harvest, I will begin to market them and soon I hope to bring in more people working to help me with the chemistry and I will have people regularly extracting DMT and mescaline if I can find a source to buy the peyote cactus.

I am also carrying out research into deliriants, I have written of DPH and Datura but as Benzydamine works on the cannabinoid receptor and I easy to obtain I’m looking into it (although my friend had a bad time on it, detailed in my first trip report), also Biperidin and Kremadin (trip reports to kremadin are at the end of my last post) are easy to obtain through an online prescription and are fairly euphoric but delirium is fairly complex and I doubt I’ll ever sell it due to no demand for it.

I have people selling for me in colleges and people on bikes who can deliver within 30mins accept none of them know they are selling for me, doubt they’ve even know who I am. I’m also considering trying to sell drugs alongside fast food with delivery men selling it but it seems the take away places are harder to infiltrate than I thought, I also have a half dozen people helping me with the chemistry and another two people advising me.

It’s complete bs that people in my area have to use violence to become the top dealers because, I just keep my business low key and make 2x as much as them and never have any trouble with police or other dealers. Though I’m beefing so big that I will unfortunately have to scale back soon.

Thanks for reading, I just had to tell a sub which i know won’t be wouldn’t inherently anti drugs/drug dealers and will also know it’s not as easy as people make out and it’s a shame I’ve put so much work into something which I can’t tell many people about and will have to shut down eventually.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,685710,public,confidence,self,I hate how people think drug dealing is easy and is only done by villains...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h8s0o8/i_hate_how_people_think_drug_dealing_is_easy_and/,no_ads,0.0,1592162214.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to drug-related charges I did a break for a few months in which i stayed off of all illegal drugs to not get into further trouble.

So basically there was my gf and one of my good friends who I didn’t saw for about 3 month because of corona. We were at a bar and had this idea to go at my house and get some weed, smoke and than go to a chinese restaurant. When we arrived at my house I said to my friend that I had just bought 1g of 2FK in the internet and that we could eventuality mix it with the weed. He was down to do it but my gf was not so enthusiastic. I said to her that she wouldn’t even notice that we are on K. So we went in my bike garage (small garage where I and my parents park our bikes) and did one 150mg line for each and a 0,5g joint with my gf. When the effects of the Ket and the weed comes up we had wanted to start to the restaurant, but the Ket was hitting more and more to the point that we stayed in the garage sittig on the ground. The whole garage was much larger and longer my friend was morphing into another human and I was confused as hell. My friend stard telling me that this stuff was to strong and that he has never been so high in his life. My gf turned into a sort of tripsitter because our trip was becoming more and more psychadelic and absurd. When I closed my eyes I had this visuals of many many blue plants that breathes and geomotric forms that are changing from 2D to 3D. 
At one point we had to turn off the light in the garage so that my parents does’t suspect something, and at the moment that my gf turned off the lights where me and my friend in a completely other universe. I started hallucinating harder and my 2 friends where like stranger. All the time I had a feeling that there was another person with us, but there wasn’t. And another feeling that I had, same as my friend, is that we are far far frome home, far from our place, from our dimension. It wasn’t fun or enjoyable but it wasn’t a bad trip too, it was like a very heavy scary trip but not horror or bad. Then afther like one and a half our we got back in the house and then it began to be fun. The Ket effects were going down and we slipped in the high of the weed. 

big thanks to my gf because without her calming us and talking to us we would be dead in that garage.

Hey guys, hope all is well with you! I’ve recently been diagnosed with ADHD and have been prescribed Adderall XR 20mg once a day. I first took it 2 days ago around 3pm when my shift started. It took an hour to start feeling the effects and lasted about 6 hours. Felt great! I was also very hydrated (water only) throughout the day and active.

Around 10pm I felt the crash and took some Olly Stress Gummies, a melatonin 5mg/5-htp supplement, and a vitamin-c packet mixed with some water to counter the side effects and I slept okay. I took the next day to recover since it was my day off and I didn’t really feel like being in go-mode for several hours.

Fast forward to today: I took it around 4pm when my shift started bc I noticed the XR wore off around 9-10pm my first day. I guess you could say I felt slight effects? Nothing crazy. Around 8:30 I get off and the effects kick in when I got settled in at home at around 9:15? It honestly felt like the peak. Euphoria, energy, etc. why were the effects so delayed this time? I know it isn’t tolerance bc I have barely started my meds and have only taken an IR a couple times, years ago. I ate raviolis about 2 hours before dosing, was the tomato/pasta sauce too acidic for the medication to be absorbed? I also had a Yerba Mate during my shift to try to kick things into gear faster. I know it’s not entirely the caffeine bc this definitely feels like an adderall high. It’s 10:55 and I still feel high. (Apologies if it’s noticeable)

I apologize if this was long but I’d really appreciate your guys’ advice! thanks :)",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,685660,public,confidence,self,Adderall XR questions,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h8oad0/adderall_xr_questions/,no_ads,0.0,1592142944.0,Stimulants,641ca724-9da7-11e5-b92d-0eab56a1424b,Stimulants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was great, I worked a lot and felt it really gave me a push in my motivation regarding the area I work in (yeah, I got so wired after that, even and specially sober).

Now, today I got this fishscale stuff from a trusted source and... NOTHING. OK, I feel like there's some stimulation here, but the euphoria is gone. And believe me, this stuff is really good, I've been using it for quite a long time and it's the real deal.

Now, I honestly don't think this is a bad thing - it's a great excuse to finally quit coke - but it feels weird. Could it be related to cross-tolerance? It's weird, and I've been using a lot of coke. Or, simply put, speed just wasted a lot of dopamine due to that binge? I never felt a big euphoria with it - I suppose it's meant to be like that - so it's just weird.

I don’t want to get too into it, but we’ve been through hell together. My junior year of highschool is when I started having drug problems. I was dependent on smoking weed, abusing adderall, drinking, and just dabbled in hydrocodone. We smoked together, and after that, things happened. We were young(er), and both going through our own struggles. The things he did, I took personally, and for too long held onto. He got better, and grew immensely as a person. I’m so proud of him, I really am. And I wish he was as proud of himself as I am in him. As for me, I got better for a little bit. He made me promise to him to reach out whenever I felt bad, to tell him if I felt like relapsing, and to promise to try to be sober. I broke each promise. I was the cause of so many ups and downs in our relationship. Each relapse or personal issue that got out of hand would become a big thing and go away, and eventually I would relapse again. And I knew it was me, not the drugs causing this to keep happening. But now, it has finally sunken in that it’s something deep in me that is the real cause of the problem. It took me almost losing the love of my life. I hurt his feelings, which hurts more than anything else, to know that I hurt him. I have been so far up my ass, so dense, because each time our relationship was good again after each relapse, I thought all was well. I never understood the toll it has taken on him. And I want it to stop here and now. He deserves the world, he deserved so much love, and I pushed him away. And my own issues have caused me to hurt the one I love. Drugs aren’t my answer, and I regret turning to them to hide my pain and problems. I took 45 mg of hydrocodone, which is by far the stupidest thing I’ve ever done. Each second of physical pleasure just reminded me of how much I miss him. How much I let him down. I’m done breaking promises. I’m sick of it. I need to be better, and want to be better. Not only for myself but for us, for him. I’m going sober finally after about two years of on and off use. 

I love him to death, and want to be sober, attentive, and 100% there for him and his needs. He loves fungi, and even has a cute field guide of mushrooms, of all shapes, sizes, and forms. He is very interested and educated on psychedelics, and loves talking about them. What hurts is that he can’t open up to me about them because he is well aware of my drug problems. One day though, we will take a trip together and it’ll be amazing, and it’ll be with the love of my life, and the universe. Until then, I’ll be working on becoming a better, healthier me. I wanted to share this, because I feel like it’s not said enough(especially to teenagers like me) how much your mind plays a role in your relationship with drugs. It took me until it was almost too late to realize just how much I have to resolve with myself, my abuse of drugs wasn’t helping me, and now I truly want to be better and healthier.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,685658,public,confidence,self,"Going Sober, and meaning it",0,[],0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h8n1uv/going_sober_and_meaning_it/,no_ads,0.0,1592137080.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Basically what the topic says, I'm currently going through EMDR for a long history of trauma related to my trans identity. I also want to add that I have a nightly habit of smoking a bowl of weed and using that time to do a little more trauma processing on my own time, although not as effectively as I do in the actual EMDR therapy sessions (I leave enough time between the session and smoking up to process properly on therapy days, so don't worry about that). I also recently received an invitation from a friend to come try LSD with her and a couple other friends next weekend.

I'm very interested in trying it, but I'm worried about how it may effect my therapy and ongoing trauma work. Now obviously the fact that I already use nightly weed smoking as a way to cope means that this won't be a huge departure from what I'm already doing, and I'll admit that part of me kind of hopes LSD (or a hallucinogenic or some other variety, my brother has warned me that I'm likelier to get some kind of chemical analogue to mescaline than actual LSD) will be the thing to finally push through some of the harder barriers my therapy has started to come up against and be the key to finally working through my most difficult problems. A more cautious side of myself is worried that it might bring up stuff in a really harmful way, give me a bad trip, and end up setting my recovery back just when I'm desperate to get it moving forward again.

So with all that being said, I suppose what I'm really asking here if anyone has experience with trying psychedelics while working through severe traumas.

I don’t have access to benzos and alcohol is the only legal anxiety relief I can get my hands on. I used to drink twice a week, a month later 3-4 times a week, then I kept taking weeks off and now I’m drinking every night for more than a week in a row. I never drinking before 4am. 


I just don’t crave alcohol during the day. I have a huge problem falling asleep. I can never fall asleep before 8am. Ironically, I sleep a lot too. I don’t feel fresh if I haven’t slept for at least 12 hours. If I sleep less than that, I need 2-4 energy drinks to wake up. I always wake up by alarm so I don’t wake up in the frickin’ evening. I keep getting shocked of how much more alcohol I need to consume to get my desired effects every night. 


I started from less than a quarter glass (maybe 0.05l) to around 0.3-0.4l a night to get the same effects. I never get fucked up or anything, I stop when I get a strong buzz. Anything above that is not fun for me anymore. All I consume is a homemade traditional drink which has around 40-65% alcohol. 


I don’t pay a penny to drink and I have 200 liters of this drink in my basement. It tastes like shit and it makes me gag. I need to quickly drink a soda after I chug it. I never got alcohol withdrawals, I never even drink when I have access to weed or anything else and I don’t crave it. Alcohol feels dirty asf for me, but it’s my only option when I can’t get any other drugs. 


I’m a little concerned as I don’t wanna develop an alcohol addiction and I need someone to tell me to stop if it’s the case.. I always drink alone while watching tv series and YouTube.

It started for me when I moved county. I had friends there already but hadn't seen them since I was 11. I believe I was 16 at this point. 

My first day I went to visit those friends. I'd never had a sip of alcohol. It was a small gathering and we mostly had a great time, watched a movie and cooked dinner. I had a couple of beers and tried vodka for the first time. The buzz was great but I was careful not to drink too much (looking back it's almost laughable how little I needed to drink to feel so much). At this point most of the others had gone home and it was me and 3 others. Let's call them tom, harry and adam. We still had a litre of vodka, but tom, Adam and I were both tired and quickly went to bed.

I woke up hearing noises from the bathroom the next day, I thought someone was taking a shit. Turns out that intense vomiting sounds just like diarrhea if you're jetlagged. I came out of my room, went to the kitchen and saw vomit pretty much everywhere close to the couch. Didnt take long after that for the gears to click, I looked around a little bit and lo and behold, the entire bottle is pretty much empty. That shit blew my mind, a single person polishing off an entire litre of drink I could only have 2 shots of before feeling woozy.

This wasnt my last encounter with Harry, and we actually became extremely close due to our shared interest in math and DnD and eventually hard drugs.

I always believed I would never do drugs, or at least wait till I was far older. but that quickly turned out to be a lie.

I started smoking weed a few months after moving. After a few more months I would try cocaine for the first time. I had a great time but I told myself I would only ever do it for extraordinary occasions (do weekends count?).

It wasnt an instant thing for me. For the first 2 years or so I never felt like I had a problem, I was getting good grades and felt quite good. But I slowly started using more and more without realizing. My cocaine use went from once every 3 months to almost once a week for a while. I tried different drugs too, mushrooms, lsd, amphetamines, ketamine. Etc etc.

I started realizing I was addicted when I would drink and immediately crave cocaine. I didnt have a dealer, but I would often be out with Harry. And that might as well have been a dealer because he had the same thoughts as I did when he drank.

I started to become more lethargic, I didn't enjoy my hobbies, my focus was all over the place. Hell, my speech, memory and balance have all gotten worse too. When I bought my own drugs from a dealer for the first time I knew I'd sunken even deeper into the quagmire.

I used drugs just to feel what I imagined ""normal"" felt like. But let me tell you, ""normal"" is not a flood of seratonin from MDMA, or the inane chatterbox with an ego that reaches the stars that you become on coke. Neither is normal the incredible focus you get from a line of amphetamine, or the supposedly deep insights that come and go while lying in bed on 200mg of ketamine.

It's been more than 6 years since I had my first drink and I'm still fighting the consequences today, and will be in the future too. 

I've tried getting sober a few times already, but the absolutely incredible cravings and my brains ridiculous way of tricking my brain into thinking it's making rational and reasonable decisions when taking drugs has made it hard indeed. 

The longest I've gone so far without any drug but alcohol is 6 months. It's one slip, one idea that says ""hey itll be fun, just one more time, it's a special occasion and you've worked hard, you earned it"" and you have to start again.

Please, if things I have said resonate with you at all. Especially if you're just starting out and you havent yet realized it's getting out of hand. Take a good hard look at yourself, ask why you're doing drugs and how is it impacting the rest of your life outside of drugs.

 If you've realized drugs are affecting you negatively, and you're going down a dark path. Steel yourself, you have to want to quit too. It wont be quick or easy but it will be worth it.

When I was sober I felt so much better, no hangovers, no comedown, no guilt, shame, fear and disgust. Studying and working didnt feel like having to carry a 100 ton truck (maybe 100kg). Your brain can lie to itself and trick you, understand that and work from there. It really is worth it, and there is so much happiness and enjoyment that can come without drugs. Even if the levels of seratonin and dopamine are lower, it's like buying a pie versus making one from scratch. It's so much better if there has been your own work put in.

I hope my story has had some impact. This was a hella big wall of text, but trust me it coulda been 10x bigger.

TLDR: most drugs are bad, addiction sneaks up on you, p much no one is immune. Life can be better sober.

well i was only gonna take like a 1/4 of the dck i have in a line so i did, first thought was holy fuck that feels nice. acid visuals mixed with the dck  and my sight started to become a salvatore dali painting, and the dripping paint visuals stretched more and more, my body started to feel lighter and lighter while (it felt like) my soul became more and more present with me if that makes sense, and i became aware of my soul, it was really beautiful not just visually. i was liking it and i was still coherent so i thought yo i’ve already had coke molly acid and a bit of dck today, might as well have the rest, so i took the rest all in one line and everything melted into what i can only describe as, man i don’t even know. at this point it felt like i was about to die, and be no more, but rather than ceasing to experience and to no longer exist i still had a perspective on the universe despite well, dying, i moved my fingers in this way and it was like i was playing the strings of the universe, i had this thought like “i’m not so different from everyone else, we all go through shit and experience pain and love and make mistakes, it’s nothing to get down on myself about, we all have a story with ups and downs, we all have low points, we all are one. i didn’t get unlucky and fuck my life up, i’m just not letting myself get better because i think i’ve went through a shitter existence than others and it’s not possible for me to get through and back on my feet, thinking i’ve had it worse is naive and causes more separation and difference that doesn’t exist, nothing is ever hopeless, the only time i don’t have a chance to get back on my feet is when i believe i don’t have any chance; everyone has went through shit and my shit is not any bigger or less than others, bad times and low points in life do not matter because pain is temporary, its equal because it doesn’t matter in the bigger picture and reminiscing about the bad only causes more separation from the present since no matter what happens, there will always be a place we can all go to that we know exists, which is the present, and we will always have some perspective on the universe and continue to exist. we’re all one, there’s no need to be so hard on myself and see myself as lesser than others. all this negativity and pain is caused by thoughts of the ego” it was along those lines. these like, metaphysical spindles and connections streamed off and connected with what felt like the rest of my soul and it felt like i had tapped into past lives my soul has went through and experienced all experiences and lessons learned in previous states of my subjective infinite existence. i no longer existed as kael yet there was still a connection i had to me/kael, yet that existence of kael is only a temporary perspective that will not always exist, cuz well ill die someday, the connection between my body and soul will die and i’ll only exist as soul/conciousness whatever that may be, the one true perspective that will always be present for me to experience, and this was the same for others as well since yk were all connected and one viewer of infinite different perspectives of the universe, so i, kael would be a perspective at a certain time from a certain point and state of existence in reality, as would abraham lincoln and a lilac and a neutron star and someone in the future and you or grant etc. yet those are all temporary, what i’m trying to say is if you, alex, die you will not cease to exist but you will leave the perspective on alex in that one time and continue on experiencing reality form a new perspective of the universe if that makes sense",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,685649,public,confidence,self,acid+dck,0,[],0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h8l2u2/aciddck/,no_ads,0.0,1592129278.0,Psychedelics,450b9864-9d47-11e5-bb1d-0ef44579b8c1,Psychedelics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The playlist I made before hand made it ten times better.  Perfect music to capture the theme.  The visuals were beautiful and trippy.  The girls faces were changing shape as I started into their eyes.  It was like I was hooking up with 100 different girls at once.  Me and my bestfriend have never been so in sync in our thought processes and I know it was just from the molly but all we were talking about was ways to make money.  My whole family was home the whole night too and no one saw anything.  It’s like everything just worked out with complete perfection.  I know my ego is just sky rocketing after that but it felt so important that me and my best friend in highschool made that happen in the matter of two minutes.  We said we wanted to hang with some bitches tonight so I called up one of my side hoes and one of her friends to come thru.  They came and waited for us outside my place, sitting on the curb.

To start off, I’d like to mention I have smoked weed around 5 times before (im a newbie and not in a bong), that english is my second language and the weed in this story was legal, so it was not bad/fake weed. With that being said let’s start. I was with friends and they started smoking out of a bong. I like the effects of weed a lot so I decided to do it as well. I take a first hit : everything is fine. I take a second (big) hit and this is where the problems started. I suddenly felt an atrocious pain in my throat and started burping a bit of air. After that i felt like my heart was freezing (it hurted a lot) and my throat felt like in fire and i was extremely dizzy and kept spitting mucus everywhere. To top it off, I was panicking a little bit and i felt like I was going to puke, but I didn’t. And it came with weird effects like hallucination (for example I hallucinated there was someone in the street or that my friends had candies) and also I had my eyes closed but It felt like i still could see! After that hour I listened to music and it helped me a lot, after some time I could get up and feel better but I suddenly felt cold : my entire body was freezing even though with an isolant jacket and a hoodie. especially my hands. My friend helped me going back home by foot and I was still tripping but I was in an okay mood. After that I ate a lot, watched vids and I went to sleep.  The day after I felt like I was very hungover. This was 2 days ago and I still feel very weird about it. Can someone help me understand what happened? I did not know simple weed could affect me like that as I was fine before, both of my parents are regular weed smokers as well so I am used to it. I found nothing on internet that I could 100% relate to. Thanks

About 5 weeks I got my hand on 20 valium 10mgs (pressed). Loved them and got more and more.

She took me to the hospital and we waited over night on a tiny bed packed with people.  I was given medicate for vertigo because I told them I hadn’t taken anything.  But I had to go to a bigger hospital for tests.  The doctor told me I had extremely high diazepam and diritive of morphine in my urine.  My mother refused to believe this and was sure them had mixed it up with someone else’s.  I was completely out of it for days in the hospital.  I found video’s on my phone of me walking around the hospital at 2 am in my boxer shorts and nothing else.  And I had gotten into a kitchen and made myself coffee. Before getting weelchaired back to my bed.  Anyways I got out after 8 days because I discharged myself.  Due to different reasons.  My mother had no idea I’d been useing drugs the last 2 years and was a big shock to her.  Also receiving letters from the hospital about suitable rehab centres was a eye opening moment about the hole I had dug for myself.  Any way 3 weeks forward my mother found baggies in my room with residue in them and knows I have drugs in my room ( story for another time).  She told me if she finds anything she is reporting it to police.  She we had quite a big falling out.

where to post this story, but I felt like I had to, and was on drugs for it, so, here goes. 

Last night I was chilling with some of my buddies and mutual friends at one of my friends houses. We smoked a couple blunts, and me and one of my buddies split an 8th and smoked all of it with a bowl in &amp;amp;lt;1 hour.  All of us being high as shit, we started a bonfire in the house owners pit and set up a bunch of camping chairs. Then the rest of the guys opened up a case of 30 bud lights. I don’t fuck with alcohol, especially while high off weed, so I popped a bar to stay in a similar headspace to the rest of the guys. 

I planned on popping another later that night depending on how I felt and giving the other two I had away (to people who were not drinking of course) or saving them for another day. But of course, in true Xanax fashion, immediately after feeling the first bar I popped the other 3 like candy. 

Immediately after taking them the friend who had rolled the blunts previously asked the group if we wanted more. Of course my drooling bartard ass was THRILLED with that idea, so I enthusiastically let out a jumble of words resembling “YES BRO YES DUDE ROLL A FUCKING BLUNT LETS SMOKE SOME FUCKIN WEEEEEEEEEEEED”...

After he had walked down to his car we waited by the fire. I was feeling fucking ecstatic and started to notice that my legs had just been made fucking useless, but I was warm as fuck from the fire and comfortable as shit, so I didn’t give two shits. I had just started to nod off in the chair as I heard tires screech to a halt down by the road. The boys got a little started and confused. We then saw a flashlight shine out of the car and completely pin our friend who was rolling the blunt. Then we heard the signature boomer ass cop voice beam out “WHAT ARE YOU BOYS DOIN?!” To our friend. 

Immediately my mind started to race. It felt like I took a hit of Coke because I was completely sober out of nowhere. Somehow i was the first to jump out of my chair. One of my closest homies was completely out cold in his chair right next to me, and I knew this man was down for the count whether the cops were coming up or not. So in a wave of adrenaline and empathy I picked up my 200+lbs friend and USAIN BOLTED across my friends yard. I swear to god I have never run faster or more coordinated in my life. I hit the fence at the side of his yard just as a flashlight shined onto my back. I didn’t look back or hesitate at all, and THREW my friend over the fence into the brush. Then I lept over it like a fuckin roo just as the voice yelled “STOP” behind me. 

As I got over the fence my shirt caught and was completely ripped in half off of my body. I’m a fat fuck, so usually I would not be ok with that, but it was the least of my concerns at the time. I realized though that I couldn’t fucking find my friend. It was pitch black dark and I was submerged in thick brush with thorns and branches restraining my whole body. After a moment of scrambling around feeling the ground in the dark I heard a muffled “bruh” on the ground to my left. I grabbed my friend by the shirt and with the insane adrenaline still pumping through my body I picked him up with one hand and forced my way into the open forest with the other. The tops of the trees were lit white behind me as I ran through the woods carrying my somewhat awake friend. The cop was hot on my ass as I ran past the fence, but upon noticing that the forest ended and I had hit a road, I knew I was safe. I jumped ~15 feet off a stone wall onto  a residential sidewalk and the moment my feet hit the ground I ran like the fucking wind. Still, somehow with my friend in my arms. 

After this, I have NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED. It was like the moment I had reached relative safety I completely blacked out. Next thing I remember is coming to to a very bright white light. I jumped awake and realized this light was a streetlight, positioned directly above me. I was sitting somewhere. I turned to my left, and there is my drunk ass fucking friend mouth breathing and snoring, completely out cold. We both are just sitting on a bench in the middle of nowhere under a streetlight in the otherwise pitch black darkness. I gotta tell ya, it was definitely one of the weirdest moments of my life. 

As the confusion cleared and the memories came flooding back, I sighed and laid my head back. *was that fucking real?* am I just high as shit and kidnapped my friend? I prayed that was the case, but as I pulled out my phone I was sorely disappointed. I had about a hundred texts. “Dude where the fuck are you??!!” “*** got arrested for felony drug possession” “they breathalyzed us dude, we all blew over and got busted”.

My friends had all blown over .02 and because none of us were over 21, they were all charged for underage drinking. A lot of them had other drugs, though, and were at the police station as I read this. Probably in jail right now. My buddy next to me was slipping in and out of consciousness. As I started to process the situation he woke up and sloppily yelled directly into my ear “Hey dude can we go to Ashley’s house??!!” (Ashley is a girl he’s been fucking) And then passed out immediately after. I couldn’t help it, I just started dying. So there I was, 19 years old, shirtless, covered in blood and thorns sitting next to a completely passed out drunk guy on a bench at 4:48 in the morning, laughing hysterically alone in the dark. 

I found out shortly after that after the first car which pulled up that had two police men in it 4 more cars pulled up fully armed and running after us full speed were searching the whole neighborhood for me and my friend. 
I don’t even know how, but apparently I evaded them all. According to my friends the police were extremely annoyed and super frustrated because apparently I wasn’t even close to as coordinated as I thought and they could easily tell that I was fucked up on more than just alcohol AND had brought another completely passed out dude with me. The cop who was chasing me’s partner apparently laughed hysterically when he saw my running, and my friend who saw me said I looked like one of those lizards that runs on top of water speeding the fuck away. The cop who was chasing me was so mad when he came back that he called a K-9 unit and was trying to get dispatch to send a helicopter to look for our dumbasses... Almost everyone else ran but we were the only people who got away, how exactly is a mystery to me. Honestly a big part of me hopes that the first officer had a chest cam because if that footage leaked... that shit would go crazy viral. 

There isn’t really a moral to this story, but I’m literally so shocked and still in such disbelief that I felt like I had to share it and get it all down somewhere.

 We live in Florida, in this state if you call for assistance for an overdose you will not be prosecuted or charged so to think that not one single person chose to save a life and call 911 and let him die and discarded his body in the woods like trash is absolutely horrific and cowardly that I can't even let myself think about it for more than a few minutes.

This one was trippy, When I would piss in the mug the piss would reach the brim but when I brought it up it was not even halfway full. In fact, each time I proceed to piss it wouldn't reach about half full. It would always reach the brim, so each time I had to inspect to make sure it was not actually full.

Music sounded amazing too! Very crisp and could hear things clearly (oh here is another phantom cigarette). Short term memory was bad, when I would watch a show on Netflix the character would say some bizarre stuff and I would have to rewind to see if that is what he said. The funniest thing is when I was on Instagram looking at picture I though they were videos so I would stare at them for long periods of time to see if they would start. I was watching NickTheSmoker on youtube and though I was in a zoom call with him lmao.

So NY has the I-STOP database, where in order to get, for example, oxycodone, one would need need a referral from a doctor.

NOW, the doctor has to submit and ask for further authorization from their higher ups, or something along those lines. I live in a state close to New York, and my state also has the same type of program. In the USA, is there a state with no such program yet established? Preferably on the east coast.

I met back up with them later in life and they told me about it, told me they used while they were in this town and how all the people were just terrible. 

They’ve been sober for about 2 years or more now, they’ve always been quiet and reserved and still are and didn’t change in many ways but.... they are saying some concerning things about seeing the future and living lives with people who they loosely know in their dreams. I love them very much and we grew up together, I know your mind isn’t the same after using meth regularly and I want to be there for them but I have no idea if I am saying the wrong thing or making them feel crazy. I am just listening the best I can and trying to understand in anyway.

I am always trying to link these dreams with maybe psychological things when we talk, and not actively saying I don’t believe them, just offering alternative ideas as to what it may be but they are dead set that they see the future. 

Most of the time they seem fine until they start talking about it and then it’s like they’ve left their body. It was worse when I met up with them last year, fortunately they are even more coherent and living with a family member in our home town in a safe place, so I’m not worried for their safety, they are in therapy and counseling and seems a lot more grounded in reality... they just seem frustrated with everyone around them and I empathize so much and I am frustrated that I can’t do anything... 

I just want to understand better and help them and be there, so I was hoping there might be someone out there to share their experience with me. Thanks for reading this far

That night I had very vivid nightmares. Super realistic lucid dreams of robbers coming into my home, me having to get away from them, my phone not working so I couldn’t call police or my mum.

Long story short, I admitted to my therapist I am dependent on benzos (my psychiatrist also prescribes me clonazepam) and she put in my charts for my psychiatrist to see that I was taking my clonazepam too often and should be cut off. I then tried to convince my fiancé to call my therapist and say that I was just saying this for attention and that I'm not actually dependent on benzos. The next day I woke up to a note where my fiancé said he was staying with his family's for a few days because he felt uncomfortable lying to my therapist for me to get drugs and that he felt I was taking too many benzos in comparison to him.

Fast forward to 3 days later (last night) and my fiancé came home after I promised him I'd keep doing my wean and only use my clonazepam as needed and that we would use it together only in low doses every once in a while for recreational use.

5 minutes later his father calls me drunk and tells me that I'm a piece of shit addict for giving his son drugs and that if he hears his son takes another pill that's not prescribed to him that he'll slit my throat. I tried to explain we didn't do it often and that benzos are relatively safe and he said, ""you're gonna kill my son and if he ODs I'm gonna disembowel you and pull your guts out through your face and that I'm a piece of shit addict scum and that how dare I give his son oxys, vicodins, Percocets (I've never once given my fiancé an opioid ever before) and that I'm gonna end up killing him and when I do he said he's gonna kill me and he has no issue going to prison for the rest of his life. I told him I have never given him opioids and I've only given him benzos and he cut me off and said that it's the same shit, pills are pills and that I'd probably stick a needle and shoot him up with heroin next. (I'm a recovered heroin addict but obv I'd never fucking do that.),

He then told me I'm an addict for taking benzos and manipulating doctors to get pills, which isn't true. My doctor offered me clonazepam because I have PTSD and my doctor is also my Suboxone doctor so he knows i don't really have the hots for benzos. And I argued if I was so addicted, how could I have stuck to my wean so perfectly with the diazepam? No meth addict or heroin addict could 'wean' themselves off meth or heroin. Even with all the stress I've stuck to my wean and have a whole bottle of valiums next to me as we speak and don't want to break my wean. (I got my valium illegally to wean off Klonopin because I find it easier to wean with). I want to get to a point I'm not physically dependent anymore and only take the Klonopin as needed and maybe every once in a blue moon 2 or 3 to relax after a hard days work. His dad said I'm full of shit and am gonna end up dead or killing his son which he said that I'd better hope to the gods that it's me who dies first or he is going to ""slice me up into little cubes.

Obviously now I told my fiancé he's never allowed to have any pills of mine ever again because he shouldn't have told his family about them if he didn't want to risk getting us in trouble. But 2. Now I'm scared shitless of his dad. I'm scared to even give him a Tylenol now. But what's scared me the most is if my fiance's god forbid does OD on my pills in a suicide attempt or by taking my pills without my knowledge if would be my head on a pike. Part of me wants to get a restraining order against his dad but another part of me just wants to call off the engagement and just run for the hills. His dad is a big dude, alcoholic and recovering meth addict.

Fellow druggies, what should I do?

Tldr: fiance's s dad threatened my life for giving his son benzos and now his dad is threatened to kill me if he hears his son ever takes another pill or overdoses.

This happened a little while ago so my recollection is a little hazy It was 3 of us all heading home from a party, we had planned to walk home through the woods but it had gotten dark and we were tired. I had only smoked some bud and dropped a tab (I had began to sober up though and was looking to be the trip sitter like usual) while one friend was on a average to low dose of kremadrin ( procyclidine ) and acid while the other friend was on acid and had smoked a lot of bud

I could tell the other two were to high to walk home so I called up my brother to give me a lift home, after a short wait he proceeds to pull up and we get in and we’re pulling off and I suddenly realise I don’t know this guy... never met him before, still tripping a little I panic and start msging my friends that I have no idea how driving. My friend on just acid msgs me back saying “😂 wtf” and then “wait, what?”

We’re msging each other saying we should just bail out the moving car, with the acid helping to increase the tension and overwhelm us with paranoia. I keep making eye contact with the driver in the mirror and I’m getting really anxious. I also msg my other friend not expecting him to be able to read/understand my msg, as he’s too high. We think this is a full on kidnapping and I’m about to call my brother when the driver suddenly says “look I don’t have any cash and I want no trouble “.  This where my friend on Kremadrin says “look mate a lot of us are broke but we don’t start kidnapping people” and at that point I see my friend (the one on Kremadrin ) has a knife out which had alarmed the driver ( don’t worry we don’t generally carry knives, it’s just one on his keys )

The driver is just straight up confused here and is not sure what’s going on and the sober part of me tells me we might be jumping the gun. So I ask who he is, he responds with something about us being crazy and that he’s an Uber driver. I continue to to grab the knife of my friend who is still holding it unable to follow what’s going on. 

Turns out my brother had asked an Uber driver he knew reasonably well to pick us up and told him where to drop us off and he also said that he would cover payment when he next uses the guy but I guess he didn’t understand that due to a language barrier, he did txt me all this but I didn’t see as I only use snapchat really

We’ve nearly arrived and I’ve phoned my brother and cleared things up, “so how much do I owe you then mate ?” Too fully become the worst customer ever I realise I don’t have my wallet. I tell him this and the cheeky bastard asks for my Louis Vuitton belt. It was only like a £20 journey. Then he says what about my watch, not interested in him going through every item of clothing, I take of my belt on the agreement that when my brother pays him he’ll give it back. 

We get out the car an my friend ( the kremadin one of course ) says “I am fuckkked, swear down I just imagined that we were getting kidnapped and I pulled a knife out an shit “ I hand him back the knife and say good night.

So I’m very sorry for frightening an innocent Uber driver, I got my belt back and I now read all my txt msgs. I also know not to accuse Uber drivers of being kidnappers but in all fairness who doesn’t greet their customers, actually we probably just didn’t hear him. Looking back on it I don’t think kidnappers generally just pull up in the hope a load of people will just jump in

Thanks for reading, thought I would add another trip story as my last one blew up although I understand this isn’t as entertaining and won’t do as well, it’s still in my top 10 trip story’s for sure

Edit: just want to say we were very apologetic to the driver and my brother tipped him very generously for the inconvenience 

Btw in case you don’t know Kremadrin ( procylidine ) its a drug used to treat Parkinson’s and can be obtained with an online prescription, it’s a popular drug in my area and especially amongst my friends, it induces delirium but is much funner than delirium from DPH, Datura, etc due to it producing euphoria. That being said it’s still pretty dangerous to be delirious and it has a dangerously long duration.

That would've been enough, but the slight feeling I had wasn't enough for me, I wanted to know why people love this shit.

Couple years go by, I'm 18 now, and I'm offered a bump from a coworker (Construction full of dope feins). I said yes and it all went downhill from there when me and that coworker started doing some before work everyday. Half a 20 everyday turns into a 20, which turns into a 40, which turns into a half and I'm sniffing up $100 everyday. 

By 19 I was shooting 40s twice a day until a miracle from God happened and I got busted by my parents. Let me tell you my parents are some of the coolest people you'd ever meet and they were pissed, but obviously they'd never turn their back. They took ALL my possessions, so I couldn't contact ANYONE and they got me started on methadone. I was weaned off that in about 3 months (easiest thing I've ever done).

Almost 1 year clean and I relapsed. Didn't take but a few months and I was shooting once again. Now here I am another year of using. Banging a fucking gram a day. I don't think my wallet can take much more, I don't think my veins can take much more considering they're almost gone, and I don't think my relationship can handle much more lying.

I thought it was harmless and would help me sleep, since I didn't really feel anything from the XTC apart from being very active and aware of my surroundings, but the complete opposite happened. 

I smoked half of a joint and as I was looking at my friend, her face got all pale and deformed and I started seeing another friend in her... Not really knowing whats happening, I was still feeling calm, but slowly everything started becoming vague and I was straight up hallucinating. At one point I claimed there were coming spiders at her mouth. Telling myself that it's all just a bad trip and nothings real, I laid down and rest my eyes but everything made me anxious, the way her arm layed on top of my legs, heck just the way my bed sheet was laying on my torso. 

Earlier that night (under influence) she was talking about witchcraft, about how she believed she was a ""grey"" witch and about how I should never let black magic into my life, and at that exact moment it felt like there were evil forces. I was really thinking about ""what if she's the black  force in my life"" just vague shit like that.

When we woke up, still feeling semi-high, I wanted her out of the house ASAP. I didn't tell her I saw what I saw, but she told me she was hallucinating while she didn't smoke marijuana that night.

I need help with pregabalin (Lyrica) withdrawal.

I’ve made this post to be a place for help for people struggling with this.

I have found that these supplements/medications help a great deal with the withdrawal:

Zopiclone - take on an empty stomach to start your day on the days without pregabalin and you will be okay for about 8 hours depending on dose.

Gabapentin - this will stop almost all withdrawal symptoms. Take with fatty food spaced apart and a carbonated drink.

Magnesium gluconate - this is a well absorbed form that usually doesn’t cause diarrhea and vomiting depending on dose. Helps a lot with tense muscle and potentiates whatever gabapentin and pregabalin you have left.

Melatonin - helps with sleep and slightly reduces anxiety. Take sublingually at night.

Water - stay hydrated.

Sugar and salt mixed with water - this can help balance the electrolytes in your brain.

Avoid glutamate (foods and other) - going off of pregabalin causes a spike in glutamate Thad creates overstimulation. Avoid MSG foods.

Cannabis / THC / CBD - this will help you so much if you’re able to psychologically handle cannabis.

Okay so I will post more in the comments but please add your advice as I need everyone’s opinion and help on how to do this.

Btw I have 50x 50mg pregabalin capsules and have to lash 14-20 days until refills.

I know I can’t just stop so need to wean down but I do have some 10mg Valium in the house, could I just switch to one of them instead or would I still get withdrawals.

Things looked too weird and everything was too bright, I started to drastically depersonalize and that’s when things got crazy. I was so convinced I wasn’t in our dimension. I heard music from nowhere and sounds like knocks which scared me. When I closed my eyes I saw pictures and numbers. I felt that there was a tv inside of my eyes. Not to mention that I saw numbers and letters and patterns  everywhere I went. I got so scared and paranoid because I thought that i was in hell. My friend who took dxm too was beside me and she started panicking. She started wanting to end her life and she was so convinced she was gonna do it. She even asked me to come with her. I was so out of my mind I freaked out but didn’t want to scare her more. I really tried to put aside the feelings I had and talked to her. What came out of my mouth when I talked to her felt like it wasn’t my voice. It felt like a robot was speaking to me from a speaker that was once my mouth. The voice didn’t sound like me. I felt that I could see myself from a 3rd person’s perspective and saw that I am indeed a robot. I swear it was scary. I started crying so much. My body didn’t feel too good so I thought I was literally dying. 

I ended up talking to my friend and the things I said made enough sense to her that she stopped panicking. She then helped me because I guess I started to lose consciousness. She said my face was pale and I couldn’t move my body. But i felt like I was already dead so I couldn’t move. She helped me to and fed me water, cause I felt that my hands couldn’t move either. We took a walk and I kept seeing the numbers and patterns and freaking out. I started to see shadows of people that eventually morphed into objects and I started to tell my friend that we aren’t in the real world and I started to observe things closer. Till we saw the same man riding a bicycle go past us twice within a span of 1 minute and that got me even more paranoid. I asked if my friend saw that too and she said yeah. I started seeing buildings look like they weren’t buildings from our dimension and I got so scared I wanted to cry more. Eventually I got home and things didn’t end there. When my friend went home I was still traumatized and paranoid cause I still heard voices and saw images. I couldn’t sleep. To this day the effects of it is not completely gone and things feel so surreal I told myself that I’m never gonna leave the house ever again.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,685537,public,confidence,self,Robotripping on DXM,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h87171/robotripping_on_dxm/,no_ads,0.0,1592081771.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I smoked kush daily and did lsd and other party drugs on occasion throughout high school and college. I also didn’t have any serious responsibilities, just school and my relationships. And honestly I had a lot of fun and often thought those were the best days to experiment. 

Now I’m mid 20’s with a serious job. Nowadays I’d rather just smoke weed and chill at the beach or play frisbee golf lol. 

I can’t imagine not having those experiences and memories from college. But a lot of people would say I was too young for all that. But they’re wrong! Live it up while you can AND THEN GROW UP WHEN ITS TIME TO.

Obviously not talking about young teens doing crack here but if you’re in college... remember you never get those years back so make the most of them

Couldn\'t have been more than a couple milligrams already melted down (and also a little burnt). I decided I wanted to clean the oil burner, and I started heating it with a torch lighter, mostly out of curiosity since most of it just seemed like burnt residue. Suddenly fumes started forming and in a ""fuck it""-moment, I decided to inhale the fumes. Was only a teeny bit so I didn\'t expect much.\n\nFor the next hour or so, nothing realy happened. As expected I didn\'t really feel anything from such a small amount of 4-HO-MET. No visuals, no loopy thoughts. A little tunnel vision which might as well have been placebo.\n\nBefore going to bed, I decided on smoking a bowl. I cleared my bong in one big hit, and coughed my lungs out for about 5 minutes (the usual). Also spilled out some water over my laptop because I had to cough while I had water in my mouth... Anyway, I have a low tolerance to weed, but I have never experienced something quite like this: within minutes I was full-blown tripping. I tried writing down one sentence and I just couldn\'t manage. My thought were racing and analyzing every single word I wrote. I brushed my teeth (which took a long time) and went to lay in bed, where I proceeded to have a journey inwards.\n\nI was completely uncapable of doing anything but just lay down and think. I even had CEV\'s. I would characterize the trip as racing thoughts &amp; pure confusion. It had all characteristics of a shroom trip but with a lack of ""deepness"", which might have been due to the fact that this was by accident and thus I had nothing planned (or just the fact that that is how I would describe 4-HO-MET).\n\nI am fairly certain that I did in fact take a ""microdose"" of 4-HO-MET, and that by combining it with a fair amount of weed it turned into a ""macro-dose""/full-blown trip. It did not feel like regular smoking while tripping (on 4-HO-MET), nor did it feel like just greening out. It rather felt like the 4-HO-MET was completely overpowered by the weed while still adding a psychedelic touch. I mostly find it interesting that such a small amount of 4-HO-MET (probably even sub-threshold according to Psychonautwiki) could have such an impact.\n\nTl;dr vaped a microdose of 4-HO-MET, smoked a bowl an hour later.

I decided I wanted to clean the oil burner, and I started heating it with a torch lighter, mostly out of curiosity since most of it just seemed like burnt residue. Suddenly fumes started forming and in a &amp;quot;fuck it&amp;quot;-moment, I decided to inhale the fumes. Was only a teeny bit so I didn&amp;#39;t expect much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the next hour or so, nothing realy happened. As expected I didn&amp;#39;t really feel anything from such a small amount of 4-HO-MET. No visuals, no loopy thoughts. A little tunnel vision which might as well have been placebo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before going to bed, I decided on smoking a bowl. I cleared my bong in one big hit, and coughed my lungs out for about 5 minutes (the usual). Also spilled out some water over my laptop because I had to cough while I had water in my mouth... Anyway, I have a low tolerance to weed, but I have never experienced something quite like this: within minutes I was full-blown tripping. I tried writing down one sentence and I just couldn&amp;#39;t manage. My thought were racing and analyzing every single word I wrote. I brushed my teeth (which took a long time) and went to lay in bed, where I proceeded to have a journey inwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was completely uncapable of doing anything but just lay down and think. I even had CEV&amp;#39;s. I would characterize the trip as racing thoughts &amp;amp; pure confusion. It had all characteristics of a shroom trip but with a lack of &amp;quot;deepness&amp;quot;, which might have been due to the fact that this was by accident and thus I had nothing planned (or just the fact that that is how I would describe 4-HO-MET).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am fairly certain that I did in fact take a &amp;quot;microdose&amp;quot; of 4-HO-MET, and that by combining it with a fair amount of weed it turned into a &amp;quot;macro-dose&amp;quot;/full-blown trip. It did not feel like regular smoking while tripping (on 4-HO-MET), nor did it feel like just greening out. It rather felt like the 4-HO-MET was completely overpowered by the weed while still adding a psychedelic touch. I mostly find it interesting that such a small amount of 4-HO-MET (probably even sub-threshold according to Psychonautwiki) could have such an impact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr vaped a microdose of 4-HO-MET, smoked a bowl an hour later. Suddenly found myself fully tripping. Didn&amp;#39;t feel like 4-HO-MET + Weed but rather like Weed + 4-HO-MET.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'researchchemicals', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rhqm', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/researchchemicals', 'subreddit_subscribers': 85510, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'Accidental trip on 4-HO-MET', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 18, 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/h840oc/accidental_trip_on_4homet/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'house_only', 'wls': 1}]",,

My brother is 30 year old and married and has 6 month old son. He drank alcohol for many years and although it is illegal in my country, nobody paid much attention to it since it is very common.  
For a year my brother is doing opium and it starting to affect everybody around him. He quit his jobduring corona pandemic and he is not interested in finding a new one. My father and I were supporting him since our income was not affected by pandemic but now it seems that he might never work again. If we do not give him money, he will say that he will die or get paralyzed.  
  
We are planning to take him to rehab when they open up but I right now everybody is stuck where they are.

I didnt plan on doing all the coke, but coke being coke I ended up snorting the whole thing. I was with some friends at the time and I had a couple shots of gin too. It was a good time. I started coming down off the coke and started getting tired so I wanted to get to sleep asap. I took 1 and 1/2 xanax bars (3mg)and since I was at my friends crib I decided to sleep on an air mattress in his little studio apartment. 

This is where I guess I black out during my sleep. I remember falling asleep, but my friend tells me that I woke up in the middle of the night choking and gasping for breath. He said that my face was pale and that I was struggling to breathe. He said I was doing this for a solid 10 minutes and he thought I was having heart or lung failure or some shit. After that he said I calmed down, he gave me some water and I fell back asleep. The thing is I dont remember a single bit of this. I have no memory of this whatsoever and that worries me so much because its fucking terrifying to know that happened. 

Does anyone know what that possibly could have been or why that happened? Its scary to think about when I have no recollection of it happening, and im 100% sure this friend didnt lie to me

I’ve recently run out of bud and have tried making joints out of a bunch of tea bags such as Green tea, Chamomile, Lavender, Peppermint leaves, etc. I’d feel a slight/nearly unnoticeable buzz from the said plants but figured either carbon monoxide or placebo induced my imaginary “high” I wouldn’t even call it a high tbh. 

Anyway, I stopped rolling herbal tea joints and ventured into the world of chocolate. As i’m typing these words right now, I can say that I am experiencing a very noticeable buzz from smoking a joint of cocoa powder, yes, cocoa powder used for baking, and it burns really well. It’s not exactly as strong as THC but i’m feeling the slight zing you’d feel from weed. I’m not kidding, give it a try yourself and let me know. 

Cocoa powder contains theobromine, and more importantly; anandamide, an endogenous cannabinoid produced by our body. Check it out:

Let me chainsmoke and cry in peace for god’s sake. 

My heart has just been broken, it feels like it can never be fixed. I know the pain will fade with time, that doesn’t make it hurt any less. She cheated on me. How much of what she said was a lie? All of it? And I loved her so much.

My neighbours are laughing again, goddamn them. 

I broke my “sobriety” last night. Sobriety is in quotations because having the occasional drink, the not so occasional marijuana cigarette and medicinal xanax counts as sobriety to me.

I convince myself I’m clean whenever I can stay away from cocaine for a few months; I lie to myself.

This was the first time I have ever been cheated on. Turns out that it hurts—it hurts a lot. Of course I broke up with her, long ago I made a promise to myself to not forgive adultery. If she was a man I would have hit her hard in the face.

I viciously despise cocaine. I love cocaine with a burning passion.

I hate myself but I think that’s normal. It seems to me that everyone hates themselves, at least behind closed doors.
I think I am going to kill my neighbours. 
And then myself.

Or maybe I will write a bit more before I do it. I’ve been killing myself slowly for years already.

I recently stopped taking my antidepressants because they were giving me nightmares causing me to wake up drenched in sweat. Oh and also I couldn’t come. Maybe that’s why my ex cheated on me. Before I started taking them she complained that she wouldn’t come and then afterwards she would complain that I couldn’t come. She blamed herself for my lack of penile enthusiasm after I assured her multiple times it was not her fault. The grass is always greener. 

My heart is in a state of dilapidation.

I find solace in the hope that my ex is close to as miserable as I am.

She can beg and beg and beg and I’ll listen to her pleas, to give her just a little bit of hope, before crushing it again.

We got along quite well, seldomly fighting until towards the end. She was the sweetest girl, always putting everyone ahead of herself (and me, ha, ha). An Angel by day, devil when she was away. Her eyes were the sun and the stars, the planets and the moons.

I basically start fully tripping out with weird visuals going through my head at 100mph and my heart rate goes up. It’s really hard to explain this but I get a pattern sort of feeling in my head where things just feel right, sort of like how writing a signature feels comfortable and right. I literally feel these patterns moving in my head for example I can sort of feel blood flow in my head of patterns that for some reason feel comfortable or right such as my writing my signature, drum patterns and certain patterns of a playstation controller. It’s not like I’m imaging in my head my hands doing these patterns, instead I can actually feel the movement moving in my head.

These go through my head rapidly and have noticed happens almost every time I’ve smoked in the last year.

The first time this happened was about a year ago at the end of a very big night partying (this isn’t a regular thing I don’t use these drugs very often) where I drank a fair bit, had 400mg of mdma, nitrous and a bag of ketamine and then to finish off the night had smoked a little bit when I got home and had a traumatic experience where I was completely messed up and seeing messed up things that I can’t even explain and was scared I might die or permanently be in this mental state.

This time was a much more intense experience of the pattern thing that I keep having because none of the things made any sense. I kept on feeling/seeing in my head random colourful lines that would make shapes and numbers that would link and for some reason felt like they just feel right however I felt a sort of extreme frustration as I couldn’t think of what these shapes were and why they make sense.


When I smoke now is do I just get a feeling of this replicating the night where I did wayyy too much or do other people have a similar feeling when smoking?

It’s now June 13 2019 and I’ve probably smoking weed hundreds of times now. (I also drink and smoke cigarettes quite a bit but I do not feel them effecting me mentally) When I started smoking when I was 14 in I would smoke a few times a month and it never really affected me. I was also much more into liqour and nicotine at the time tho. But since September I’ve been smoking daily and it definitely has affected me pretty bad. My short term memory is fucked and I can’t think straight at all. I used to be so smart but I can’t think well at all now. My heads always cloudy and I can’t pay attention at all. It’s really starting to bother me and I’m getting scared that I really did ruin my life. The other week I got really high and convinced myself that I was a schizophrenic because I was hearing voices and ringing in my head. and that pot gave it to me. But that when away over the next 3 days. I’m trying to quit but at this point in my life I can’t and need to buy a few more months before I do. I just had a few questions for you guys who smoked heavily at my age.
1. Did you have the same effects I did?
2. Do they go away?

I was running a few weeks ago like usual, but because of traffic, I had to continue on the opposite side of the street until I got to my house - I never run on this side of the street.  Anyway, I end my run and continue walking, but I only take a few steps before something reddish in the grass on the side of the road catches my eye.  I subconsciously think ""bag of salt packets"" take about 3 more steps and feel an urge to check that bag of salt packets out.  I turn around, pick it up and it proves to be, quite obviously, a bag of drugs!

In the bag are individually bagged/ziplocked sort of wax paper sleeves containing a white powder.   The sleeves are folded up into squares and a red emblem is stamped on each wax paper sleeve square.  ""Versace"" it says, over a Greek goddess looking like Medusa (the standard Versace logo).

Now I'm no fool.  I'm aware of research chemicals, bath salts, spice, fluorinated CB1 receptor agonists.   This stuff is pure white, very small flakes that are irregularly sized, has a mild synthetic scent (the bigger bag). 

In order to hazard a guess as to what it is, I weighed a dose --- 6 mg.

Between the versace logo, the dose, and the smell, I'm thinking some kind of RC that is supposed to be like, or passable as, MDMA.  MDMA, google tells me, should be 100-150 mg.

Can anyone hazard a guess as to what it is?  I'm pretty weary of the RC scene, after contemplating getting some of the fluorinated ""spice"" years ago and deciding against it just before the fall-out --- people completely ruining their psyche --- and now realize the decision not to get it was one of the most formative of my life, really. 

So, what do ya'll think?  Anyone know of RCs that are similar to MDMA in the 6-12 mg range?

Synchronistically, I had just ordered a book on psycholytic therapy, and was considering not quite microdosing but low-dosing during therapy, so I'm super curious as to what this stuff is and maybe it is a gift from above.

Those are technically legal but they are basically sisters to very known and illicit drugs, so I won't go into those. I'm talking about stuff you can go into CVS or on Amazon and get legally with zero effort. I will rate each one on a scale of 1-10 and go into details about my personal experience with them.

Kratom: 7/10 Never been a big fan of opiates and only used Kratom sparingly, never got addicted or withdrawals from it however my aunt went thru TERRIBLE withdrawals and it was scary. It was relaxing, calming, had a nice effect on my back pain caused by 2 herniated disks. Took the edge off of LSD, MDMA, and was greatly enhanced by Phenibut, Alcohol, weed, benzos and nitrous. Not really mind altering or intoxicating at all. Wouldn't consider it a ""high"" by any means.

Phenibut: 9/10 the first legal supplement that made me say ""Holy shit this is legal?"" I took 3.5 grams my first time and was almost floored after the 3 hour mark when it really started to kick in. Felt like all the good social enhancing attributes of alcohol with zero of the bad or dumbness that it has, mixed with the chattyness and loviness of mdma and other stimulants, however at the same time I wasn't super stimulated, physically I was very relaxed but I was just feeling on top of the world talking to anyone about anything and everything. Comedowns/withdrawals are not bad at all if you don't abuse it, once a week max with phenibut. Take it consecutive days will cause bad cravings, and a terrible crippling mental fog and physical sluggishness. Made LSD a much more relaxing experience, paired well with anything. 

Nitrous Oxide: 7.5/10 This one is interesting. In my opinion its not really at all meant to be done on its own, this is made to be done very occasionally and only when your using a substance like LSD or MDMA. Maybe alcohol. With those substances it acts as a turbo button. Like you just hit the NOS in a fast and furious car. It will enhance the effects of other drugs immensely, however its very short lived, and the negative impact it has on the brain and body is very iffy. Ive always heard people say it kills brain cells, research says otherwise, and personal experience says something completely different. I've had what I would call seizures using this stuff. When you do them on there own it lasts 25 seconds and all you can think about is doing more and more and you will chase that high until there's no cartridges left. Definitely is a ""high"" and probably is the most mind altering drug on this list. If I had to describe the feeling in one word it would be METALLIC. Think green question mark box in Super mario 64. Metal mario. That.

Phenethylamine: 10/10 This one fucking blew my mind. Its pretty short lived, the entire experience, (the come up, peak, and come down) takes maybe an hour. The peak lasts maybe 10 minutes but holy shit. Ive never done Crack, but that's what I picture Crack to feel like. Its like this insanely euphoric hyper focused feeling that feels like a high dose MDMA+Amphetamine+Cocaine combo that just comes out of nowhere and smacks you all at once. As soon as it starts to fade you become so sad and kinda tired and just spaced out, and no matter how much you take that feeling will not be replicated until you wait about a week to lose your tolerance. I know this sounds insane but in that short time frame of this high I personally experience just about equal if not more euphoria than I would on a high dose MDMA roll. I know that sounds insane but its true. This shit does not feel like it should be legal. Must try if you have any interest in it, it will not dissapoint, just take a proper dose 2.5-3.5 grams in my experience.

DXM: 4/10 Never really experienced any psychedelic or euphoric effects from this,  for me there's a razor thin line with the dosage. What I mean by this is I feel like I either don't take enough to feel anything, or I take too much and get sick and am miserable for hours. The sweet spot is hard to find, and the only recreational value in DXM in my opinion is the music enhancement. Thats the one effect I noticed is it makes music sound incredible. Other than that not fun not worth it. Use it for coughs not for getting high.

Diphenhydramine(Benadryl) 5/10 Slightly more mind altering and psychedelic than DXM, but is pretty physically uncomfortable and causes insane cotton mouth. Glad I did it for the experience and did have what I would consider ""a trip"", a weak one but still a trip nonetheless. Low doses are great as a sleep aid or to prevent itchiness on opiates.

Propylhexedrine(Benzedrex) 8.5/10 This is the Meth of legal highs. Look at the chemical structures of this and compare it to that of methamphetamine. Nearly identical.Widely available and one of the most recreational substances ive experienced. Very stimulating, euphoric, and best of all long lasting. However it does feel pretty ""dirty"", can make you very sick if you overdo it and the whole process of extracting is very tedious and annoying, and the concoction you have to drink is probably the most god awful thing I've ever tasted. 2 inhalers is what I found to be the ideal dose.

do you think drug use has shaped or altered your taste in music?

whats a good album youve listened to lately?

and whats a genre of music you wish to explore but just havent given the time?
 
for me it’s;
yes it has, but not as drastically as i wouldve expected. my taste was always all over the place and relatively experimental and i think drugs, specifically psychs and weed, really helped that

honestly i havent had the attention span for full albums lately but lorde - pure heroine is always a great one when im high ngl, and talk talk’s laughing stock is extremely beautiful if it’s your kind of thing, definitely isnt for everyone

and ive been saying i want to explore a lot of jazz subgenres and classical music for years and i still havent grazed the surface. atleast i finally got the classics like miles davis’ kind of blue and such


anyways have a great day/night guys, i look forward to seeing what you are all into. and never ever let anyone shit on your taste, if you listen to top 40 exclusively, or another commonly hated category, be proud of it. if you enjoy it, dont ever be ashamed of your taste. conversely never close yourself off either, having an open mind and exploring art, and letting it expand your perceived boundaries of what art is capable of has been one of the most rewarding things about existing, for me that is.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,685457,public,confidence,self,drugs and music,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h7yx0h/drugs_and_music/,no_ads,0.0,1592044775.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My mum grew up with a father that was almost never home, and a mother that used to have multiple lovers who all used different types of drugs.
My mum saw some horrible stuff when she grew up, we're talking about 10 years of age!
Every since she has always been against drugs, she admitted that she smoked during difficult times, and stopped many years ago, but never crossed the nicotine line.

My dad never smoked, never consumed anything other than alcohol, he never cared to try out something new because he knows many drugs are dangerous. Well, some can be, but not all are harmful when not abused.

I moved out of my parents house last year in August, since then I was free to do what I wanted.
I've always been very curious, I always wanted to know why people use drugs even though they're ""all"" dangerous.

So I started reading, doing my research, and I found out truffles are legal where I live, you can buy them in smartshops and that's it.

Loved the experience, the visuals, all the sensations.
Mixed up with some repressed love sickness, I never really felt bad during the trips, never felt really sad, just reminding myself the good old times.
So to me they're amazing, but both my parents still believe that using mushrooms or LSD will make you believe you can fly. That they're both dangerous and that you should never use them.
It would be a shock if they knew about it.

A bit later I bought myself my first mushroom grow kit, learned a lot about mycology and so on.

Came across a couple of articles listing different types of psychedelics that aren't addictive and/or create physical harm (Obviously in a safe and controlled environment with a good trip sitter).
So I decided I wanted to try out LSD as well.

I think I've had a very very small jar with LSD for over 2 months now, tested it but never consumed it.

I was a bit worried about the duration, the right time, busy with work AND the idea back in my head that my parents are moving back to my country, in the house I'm currently living in.

So that's where I'm stranded, my parents are both very nice and understandable, but I am scared they will poorly judge me and see me as some kind of junkie-disappointment of a son.

Sorry for the long post, English is not my native language and it's very late in the night, so please ignore any grammatical errors I've made.

SWIM is a 20 year old 175 pound male, Swim extracted Mimosa powder, roughly 20mg via the dream machine.

Effects include Closed eye visuals, open eye visuals, auditory hallucinations, Feeling of dread, inanimate objects appear alive.

I'm sitting in my bed with my roommate in the living room in a call with someone, Immediately after smoking, I feel like I was taken to hell, not in bad way, but because everything takes a dark tone of red like as if I had put on a pair of sunglasses indoors (certainly I did not) a moment later I hear two voices talking to each-other and maybe to me I cannot remember what they said but they each had their own tone and spoke very lucidly almost as if someone other than my subconscious, I believe it was my internal monologue... or duo-logue?

As for the visuals, I had that filter on my vision, No hallucinations I would say, I felt very grounded to reality beside a pile of clothes looking like a ""thing"" kinda freaked me out a little, When I closed my eyes first I saw what I would describe like a old film [intro](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F384072674443955533%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw3LlzALY2HQjeqFZ2qBHuxa&amp;ust=1592095146400000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCKi2hOPG_ekCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAG) or a [clapperboard](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freepik.com%2Ffree-photos-vectors%2Fclapperboard&amp;psig=AOvVaw1taimjQ-IW2U-qwIt9EIdJ&amp;ust=1592095254656000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCMCnnZPH_ekCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAJ), then a few seconds later I would see a swirling wheel like [this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhypnosis-wheel%2F9wzdncrfjk46&amp;psig=AOvVaw0ULGOBXb_r9AJlCZdjvzYU&amp;ust=1592095393255000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCKD0mNzH_ekCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAJ), It was spinning slowly, and I could make up a clown face in it swirling around, when I refer to this clown it was by no means a sharp detailed face with colors, but like a black and white face, maybe due to our brains ability to recognize patterns, I would open my eyes and see my room as normal with that filter I mentioned before but still see this ""clown"" in my imagination.

Sometime in the trip I saw a visual that was the coolest part of this, I made a very raw drawing of it [here](https://ibb.co/swBXwWr), those two columns spinning yet connected to the top and bottom to a stationary background very much like a wormhole, after that I was back in my room as a normal, sober, being.

The part of dread that I speak of it that sometime during the comeup I felt guilty of tripping, anxiety maybe, I had never done DMT before, I'm a junkie, Yada yada, but I also felt as if the drug had called for me or tricked me or even like I was destined to be smoking DMT at this exact moment, then I really Felt dread and maybe hopelessness as If I hadn't chosen to do DMT that day, it chose me.

I was in one of the “backrooms” stuck in the matrix and everything looked so unreal to me, I couldn’t tell which was real and which was not. I got super paranoid thinking that i was part of a tv show and the whole world was the Audience. I felt like I was a soul trapped behind a shell of a robot which became my body.  I felt so scared. The lights felt much hotter than usual and it started burning my skin. I was sitting on a chair and I felt that the lights were all part of the show. The lights were also sucking moisture out of my skin and I felt dehydrated. I was sweating so profusely and my heart was jumping out of my chest. I could literally feel myself start to melt into the chair. It was all so surreal. My surroundings didn’t feel familiar even tho I was at home. I started searching for clues to confirm that I was still at home but the more I searched, the more I started to realize that things looked weird. 

Things looked too weird and everything was too bright, I started to drastically depersonalize and that’s when things got crazy. I was so convinced I wasn’t in our dimension. I heard music from nowhere and sounds like knocks which scared me. When I closed my eyes I saw pictures and numbers. I felt that there was a tv inside of my eyes. Not to mention that I saw numbers and letters and patterns  everywhere I went. I got so scared and paranoid because I thought that i was in hell. My friend who took dxm too was beside me and she started panicking. She started wanting to end her life and she was so convinced she was gonna do it. She even asked me to come with her. I was so out of my mind I freaked out but didn’t want to scare her more. I really tried to put aside the feelings I had and talked to her. What came out of my mouth when I talked to her felt like it wasn’t my voice. It felt like a robot was speaking to me from a speaker that was once my mouth. The voice didn’t sound like me. I felt that I could see myself from a 3rd person’s perspective and saw that I am indeed a robot. I swear it was scary. I started crying so much. My body didn’t feel too good so I thought I was literally dying. 

I ended up talking to my friend and the things I said made enough sense to her that she stopped panicking. She then helped me because I guess I started to lose consciousness. She said my face was pale and I couldn’t move my body. But i felt like I was already dead so I couldn’t move. She helped me to and fed me water, cause I felt that my hands couldn’t move either. We took a walk and I kept seeing the numbers and patterns and freaking out. I started to see shadows of people that eventually morphed into objects and I started to tell my friend that we aren’t in the real world and I started to observe things closer. Till we saw the same man riding a bicycle go past us twice within a span of 1 minute and that got me even more paranoid. I asked if my friend saw that too and she said yeah. I started seeing buildings look like they weren’t buildings from our dimension and I got so scared I wanted to cry more. Eventually I got home and things didn’t end there. When my friend went home I was still traumatized and paranoid cause I still heard voices and saw images. I couldn’t sleep.

I have taken 2-CB twice prior to this trip and I just regret everything about doing it this time.

I took a Yellow Batman around a month ago at a friends house and had a really good time, albeit I hardly felt a thing and spent the complete time almost sober (although my pupils were dilated when I looked in the mirror) and I thought it was quite a gentle drug with minimal negative effects. Fast forward to this month and I have two left and take one while chilling with some buddies on Discord. I decide after an hour of feeling nothing that I will take another Yellow Batman and take the second which totals at around 40mg.

I then experienced a strong nausea type feeling in my stomach (the only other time I experienced this was the first time I smoked a cigarette when I was really young) and I go to lay down after leaving the call with my friends as I felt a little off. I decide that I will have my lights off and start watching some YouTube vids until the effects kick in.

Around 30 minutes after my second dose I notice the visuals slowly come on and I am enjoying myself quite a bit with the bright colours and bouncy visuals. Then all of a sudden it gets really dark and I am overcome out of nowhere with a sudden sense of doom and despair. I try and shrug it off but it turns my visuals ""muddy"" and black as if theyre being overtaken by something. I start to text my friend for reassurance and sure enough: It's 3am theyre fast asleep.

Around an hour into the trip and my visuals are extremely dysphoric. I peak on the drug with the thought loop of falling inside a meat tenderiser and the detail I could see from being in that thought was disgusting. I couldnt get out of that loop and it began alternating between that scene and a car crash and it was just really unpleasant to experience, after this all my thoughts are becoming negative I am seeing hollow faces in the fractals and I realise something: I used my last Valium last week, I completely forgot I had none left. So I am full panic mode silently in my room crying about how I have ruined my life and that I just want the trip to end.

The colours still periodically enter and leave and the OEV's are intense it was like spaceships were whizzing past my head and my stomach was contorting and swirling. I decide to shower since I was having quite intense hot flashes and at first the shower was really calming but it quickly got too much for me as the steam began to make me struggle to breathe. I got quite suicidal out of nowhere and kept thinking about how I was going to write my letter, even though I never had any thoughts that pointed to suicide at the time.

Around 2 hours into the trip I do notice a small change and that it was the beginning of the comedown. I am really panicky now and terrified of just anything, the thought of life and especially dying as I convinced myself I was one with everything and since everything was one with me if one dies thats it.

Right now I am REALLY struggling with my anxiety. I got an emergency script of Valium 2mg and took one (they only give me 10 and they are super reluctant about even that) and it did absolutely nothing to help my anxiety.

My questions are:

Is this some kind of serotonin withdrawal I am experiencing?

Did I fuck my mind up by being unable to abort the trip?

Why is my anxiety now over the same issues as it was in 2017? I ask this one because I feel the 2C-B has just reopened the door to my demons that I have been working on stopping (I am overweight but losing weight and trying to get my confidence back)

I was with a mate driving around at night and we were tryna find a good spot to stop and smoke. We saw a carpark next to the water and thought it was alright so we pulled over, little did we know it was on the police route and cars regularly drive down there to check nothings going on. So we smokin, bumpin music, got the bong out and the bud on the dashboard then suddenly we see a car, we think its just some random dude so we don't move but as it gets closer we see its a cop car and start throwing everything in compartments and my mate turns over, looks at me and says ""tell em we gay"". So we went with it, keep in mind neither of us have a licence. The cops hop out and come to the window, we tell them we forgot our licenses and my mate said he was just picking me, his ""boyfriend"" up for a night drive, they asked for our age and when we told them they asked where our plates where. (Plastic things on front n back of car in Australia showing the level of licence). My mate said he forgot them and all they said was remember them next time (normally instant fine without some sort of reasonable excuse and a nice cop) but they didn't seem bothered by it at all.

and then the weed, we hotboxed the shit out of this car and somehow they didn't smell it or who knows, maybe they were legends and ignored it because they literally then said they were looking for kids smoking weed but it didn't seem like we were doing that at all, they took our names, told us to have a good night and left.

I don’t typically use them unless it’s to wear off stimulant induced anxiety or insomnia. Aside from that, I don’t like benzos and don’t take them if I’m not taking Adderall. 

I’m a typically anxious person in general though. A lot of people and websites are saying that I might experience physical withdrawals as well as psychological withdrawals... but the thing is, I haven’t experienced neither? I don’t think so?

I feel like I’m the same equally anxious person as I was before Xanax usage. My last dosage .25 mg about a week ago.

Aside from an affinity for changing my state of mind with drugs, I also live a super healthy life style. I hope others do aswell. It makes life as wonderful as possible. Not to preface I do not get high on the following. Heroin, Black market Methamphetamine Crack, and PCP. (I and say black market because I use adderall but would not smoke or snort Crystal Meth)

YESTERDAY 

11 am: 45mg Adderall Xr 

3pm: start 22 mi bike ride

4pm:  210 mg of Mitragynine (potent kratom extract)

3pm-7pm: several Bowls of marijuana the whole ride
  
7pm :  end ride

9pm 4mg of K pins ( rarely use these to be honest)




Over all it was very delightful.  I try to keep my body healthy but fun.

I consider myself an ""experienced user"". Now, my favorite/main cocktail is a prescription opiate (usually tramadol), a benzo (always k-pins), liquor, weed and a regular grapefruit. I know it's a stupid combination but I've acquired a high tolerance through the years. At first was just opiate+liquor+weed but I threw in the benzo to mitigate seizures (Tramadol decreases seizure threshold) and ended up liking the combination. I've actually had seizures before but totally unrelated to Tramadol, I'm not epileptic.

The thing is, last week I ran out of benzos and weed. I replaced the benzo with dramamine (anti-histamine), no weed. Took 900mg of dramamine, 1g of tramadol (usual dosage) and drank some liquor. The combination shocked me out of my socks, I don't know if it was the dramamine potentiating the opiate, Tramadol isn't that strong itself (Codeine-tier). Or if it was me eating the grapefruit an hour in advance. The thing is, I felt stupid high like I hadn't feel in a while and I couldn't move, swallow and had a hard time breathing. I was just lying against my wall helpless. The first hour it felt good but then I got really scared because the feeling was getting so strong I couldn't focus on breathing. Ended up monitoring my breathing the whole fucking night, making sure I was in rest position. Had fever for a couple of days and a strong headache, slept for 3 hours then couldn't sleep for two or three days. I was convinced I was going to die for a good amount of minutes, using an OD I had many years ago as reference.

Now, I don't know how to go from here. I told myself I should try sobering up for some days, then think what to do when I had a clear head. It's been almost 14 days and I'm not feeling anything from being sober, I'm bored as fuck and I genuinely love getting smashed senseless. On the other hand, I've ODed or almost ODed before, and I can't say I ODed last week but it felt very scary, like this is the fourth or fifth scariest misadventure I've had.

Haven't really been feeling WD symptoms. I take Mirtazapine for sleep and other shit. I counted all the benzo doses I had and reserved some for tapering off since a couple of months ago and I successfully tapered from multiple pills, to a quarter of a pill, to no pill at all. Alcohol WD symptoms already gone.

TL/DR at the bottom.  
Quick blurb on me, I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety at about 15 and have been on Citalopram ever since. Mostly stable the entire time minus a few hiccups (Like around big exams from college, that kind of thing).  


As a late teen I smoked a bit of pot (like, every 3-4 months) and drank like a normal adult, every other weekend with friends, never blacking out, I was actually the responsible friend of the group.  
Fast forward to when I moved out post  college at 22-23. My roommate enjoyed a glass of red wine in the evening, so I would join her with white instead. We had great fun, dance parties, art projects, that sort of thing. But my drinking went from 1-2 glasses to half a bottle. To full bottle  


Over the years my drinking escalated as my tolerance grew. I will admit I am an alcoholic but I am a high functioning alcoholic. I don't miss work. I don't have debt and pay my bills. I don't think and drive. I'm not a mean drunk, I set my drinks for the night and s tay with it and don't black out. I haven't lost friends and family over my drinking (They are concerned but because I have my shit together, they don't nag me).   


At this point in time, I think 1 bottle of wine with 2-3 Ciders (So about 5%). I stay home when I drink and pretty much only play online games with friends.  Then I drink a shit ton of water, have some snacks, go to sleep and have no hangover the next day.  


Well life in general has been steadily going downhill. With the COVID19 I'm having extreme job dissatisfaction. I can't see my friends as much when I am a very social person. A few other mental issues like self esteem stuff but that's old hat.   


To the point: My dad had a heart attack last week. He is a super healthy guy. We could have lost him.   
But now he's fine. But ever since I have not been able to deal, it's like all my issues crumbled down at once and I couldn't deal. I couldn't breath, I couldn't stop crying. So I went to my doctor.  


He increased my Citalopram from 20mg to 40mg. He add Klonopin twice a day to keep me calm during the day.  I believe it's 1mg. 

It's been day 5 on these meds. I don't feel the crushing anxiety anymore or the extreme sadness but sort of like a zombie. I sleep A LOT.  (I've been granted leave off work).  


I took another turn for the worst. My uncle was in the ER last night (hes okay but as soon as I heard my anxiety skyrocketed) and my dad is having some issues and complications following his heart attack.  
I want a drink so bad. So I can mellow out, laugh, joke with my friends,  be creative (I love singing and writing when I drink) and get a good night sleep for once.  


\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*I took my 40mg Citalopram this morning and 1mg Klonopin. I'm due to take the other one at 11pm.  
If I skip the Klonopin tonight, am I able to have some wine without experiencing crazy black outs?

Made a video saying that he had ""transcended"", gave his personal address and gave 24h for people to come and help him, after that he went missing. The police found and arrested him, then he was put in a psychological ward for 2 weeks. 

I really can't tell if he really ""found something"" or just simply lost it. Perhaps the drugs brought up some underlying issue (like BPD) or some other mental illness. What do you guys think?

Heres his goodbye video, where he has a mental breakdown. He had posted a series of really weird videos before that (now deleted) questioning the self, reality and time.

He text the dude and made sure it was okay he passed the number over to me and then warned me the guys nice and the gears great but he's serious so do not fuck him about. 

Cut to a week later, I was in the local boozer and was a fair few beers deep and decide I'll give the new plug a buzz. He send a driver and the dudes there in twenty minutes, I jump in pass him the money and go back to the pub. The coke was great and the night was even better! 

So I wake up the next morning with nasty headache to a bunch of missed calls from my girlfriend's friends boyfriend, he's all frantic and shit saying what did you do what did you do. And I'm like what's happening? And he says the dealer is looking for mw because I gave him a twenty pound not and recipet and so I thought I was in serious serious serious trouble, my mate says he's gonna kick my head in. 

I'd literally just smoked a joint to cure the comedown, naturally I went in to a frantic panick, my girlfriend calmed me down and and helped me build up the courage to ring the guy. So I bell him and he says 
""Yo, don't worry about mate was obviously an accident pass it me next time you need some.""

The friend said it was tested to be lsd,so we trusted him and took them. 
Fast forward to whn we drop the tabs. They have no taste. Good sign. Another 2 hours pass. We feel no effects, and have concluded we probably just got sold empty blotters. 
After about the 2 hour mark, i started feeling some tension in my neck and back. My body felt uneasy and uncomforteable. It felt like i had to move, and i got alot of energy. The comeup felt pretty similar to an lsd comeup, just that my body felt more uncomforteable, it hit 2 hours after what it shouldve done and my mind felt completely sober. 
Personally, that was about the whole night for me. My body felt werid and unpleasant, and i had some muscle spasms throughout. I had some minor visuals, i would say they were similar to ~100ug of lsd, but again,my mind felt completely sober. My head felt abit slow, and it did the next day too. 

The day after, i talked to one of my other friends who took it too. He had an way more intense trip than i had. He had the same body feeling, but he had a mind high too. He felt sober, but weird stuff happening to his head. Stuff i have heard people tell after taking datura. Seeing people walking around that arent there, being in his room, blacking out and waking up eating dry pasta in his kitched etc. Weird stuff, but other than that he too felt like he was thinking clear.

My closest guess,is that it was DOB. It matches both all the effects from the body stimulation, late hitting, minor visuals, but we didnt get a mind-high. Again i have no idea.
If any of you have any guesses what it could be i would be interested in hearing them.

TL;DR: tabs were small, 0.7x0.7cm maybe, tasteless, hit 2-3 hours after taking. Had an unpleasant body-stimulation, minor visuals and a clear head.

I (19M) have been researching psychedelics for quite some time now and I’m dead set on tripping soon.

I’ve got a few friends who are pretty experienced with drugs and down to trip sit me and I have my own house and all the facilities I would need and everything but I’m keen to start light and then work my way up. I don’t want to jump into the deep end too much with psychedelics as that can really fuck you up.

I was originally going to try out a low dose of Shrooms and then if that went well try LSD at some point too but when speaking to my friend who is a pretty regular psychonaut he recommended starting with 2CB because it will make you trip balls however it’s probably the least intense trip you could have so it seems like the perfect place to start for me.

I’ve been set on this idea of starting with 2CB for a couple weeks now and have been trying to sort a decent source but my GF (19F) has taken (Acid and Ecstasy) and 2CB before and she said I’d be more suited to starting on shrooms because I’m not that interested in the ‘party-drug’ aspects of 2CB I just wanna trip. I was just planning on chilling in my house with some tunes on and just seeing how it goes but my GF thinks that wouldn’t work well as I’m more likely to feel more of the Ecstasy like effects of the drug and less of the hallucinogenic properties and she thinks it’s more likely to go south if I’m just sitting not doing much and my heart is racing and I’m full of energy and shit (on 2CB) so maybe starting with Psilocybin Mushrooms would be better ???

How has everybody else’s experiences weighed up in light of this?
What psychedelic would you recommend to start on if I just wanted to experience tripping?
Is 2CB more of a party drug and less suited to just sitting around the house not doing much?

Any advice and tips would be appreciated!

But, because of the law, I couldn't get any information on if he was okay, etc, even though I'm an immediate family member.  My question is, how do these situations usually end up?  I don't know 100% how much he took, but I know him well and it was definitely ridiculously more than any average person could handle, and obviously more than he could.  Maybe 3 bottles of wine, ≥50 mg of ambien, (this is just a hypothetical situation based off what I know his tendencies to be, but the point is, it was a lot).  Are people often able to recover from an overdose like this?  I'm asking because I can't get any information from the hospital, they can't even tell me if he is okay.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,685409,public,confidence,self,Overdose question,0,[],0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h7f89b/overdose_question/,no_ads,0.0,1591970789.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You just have to exercise some self control when the timer is up, take out a dose and relock it. but nothing is gonna stop you from taking it all out and using it.

I’m done with them unless things get extremely bad. I’d be willing to try supplements or even alternative prescribed meds that I could try. Or just about anything else.

So when i was about 18 i was unemployed and dabbling in various substances available to me, i would occasionally order nang delivery from a Facebook page as i'd been introduced to them a couple months before at schoolies, i loved the feeling i got from them and i was hooked instantly, as a joke one day while i was getting my delivery i handed the delivery dude my resume not expecting anything to come out of it. Weeks later i received a Facebook message saying he wanted to give me a trial.

This is the point where my descent into nang abuse started, i got the job and would often drive for 10 hours a night delivering 3 days a week, whenever i'd get paid i would often purchase 100-150 canisters and just pump them one after another in my room until i fell asleep. There would be weekends when i wasn't working where i would easily consume 250 canisters in a sitting while on MDMA which was most weekends, this continued for about 6-8 months until i lost my license and was unable to deliver anymore. I continued abusing Nitrous Oxide fairly regularly until i noticed i was losing feeling in my hands and feet, i also would often get out of bed and when i would stand up i'd feel a sharp pain in my heart. These aftereffects finally resulted in my decision to quit, but i felt like the damage had already been done, i estimated to have indulged in about 5000+ nangs without any harm reduction or care for my own well being.

As of writing this post i have for the most part quit nitrous oxide outside a few slip ups here and there while drunk/ beaming (never over 20 in a sitting). My feeling has comeback in my hands and feet but I've realised that my memory short term and mid term is almost nonexistent i frequently cant remember what i was doing 2 minutes ago, what i had for breakfast or what last week consisted of. I recognise this is my own doing and my own fault and I've been stupid in the past but i was curious as to if anyone else has experienced this and will my memory return over time? or will i forever have self induced off brand Alzheimer's.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,685389,public,confidence,self,Nangs (Nitrous Oxide) fried my memory and nerves,0,[],0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h7d08b/nangs_nitrous_oxide_fried_my_memory_and_nerves/,no_ads,0.0,1591960812.0,Dissociatives,477d2e0a-9d47-11e5-acc7-0eafb3f81101,Dissociatives,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel like I need to open up about this to experienced/similar people. It'll be a LOOONGGGG post I'm afraid. But I really need some outside opinions. I would really appreciate your inputs. I know there are people who have much biggers problems then I do in regards to drugs, so my problem will seem like it's nothing, but still, I have this inner discomfort that's been messing with my mind, very possibly because of my anxiety, or because I'm really fucked up. But it's important for me, I've been questioning myself a lot man.

So, I have chronic depression(I've made my peace with it, it's fine, anxiety is my main issue, I can force myself out of depression, but anxiety is different), panic disorder and general anxiety disorder, it's not like social anxiety, most of the time I don't even entirely know what I'm anxious about, I just have this sense that something's gonna go bad, depending on the context. Like, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna go crazy, I'm gonna lose a family member etc. Like things will get out of control and I won't be able to do anything about it. Most of the time I don't even know that what's bothering me, it's like, ""I'm anxious right now, and there has to be a reason for that"", and I find myself thinking, trying to figure out what could go wrong that would destroy my life in that particular sitation. ie. a heart attack, brain aneurysm, or some life-threatening disease that isn't even named yet, something extremely rare and something that will happen to me, like, I'm gonna be one of the first subjects of that neurological disease that is brand new to human kind; Doctors won't even know what it shit it is kind of thing. Not something trivial per se, but something that will be a major threat to my well-being. It does not go like this; ""I'm anxious because of 'this'"", it's more like ""I'm anxious because, well, there has to be something wrong, I need to find something to be anxious about, something that would really fuck me up"". I hope you guys understand what I'm trying to say, I know it sounds stupid.

I'm on 150-225 mg on effexor,  for like ten years. The dose changes depending on how I am coping. Despite all this fuckery, I have a lot friends, a supporting family, and I am fairly successful, I'm not Jeff Bezos, but I'm doing fine. But, I drink a lot, by that, I mean I drink 2-3 nights a week, 6-8 pints of beer a night, usually on weekends but also on thursdays if I don't have  responsibilities on fridays. This has been the case for like 8 years. There have been some periods of time where I stopped taking anything (except effexor ofc) for a month, just to see if I would be able to, and I've been able to that; I don't take anything for a month once every year, usually around summer.

But, the thing is; I'm also prescribed Medikinet 20mg( Controlled Release Methylphenidate) on an as-needed basis, workload gets overwhelming every now and then, and It helps a lot. It helped me graduate with a 3.43 gpa(out of 4). It also helped A LOT with my master degree. And, since I started drinking around 10 years ago, (when I was around 18), I've been going out mostly if drinking was involved, and I've been taking Ritaline before going out. Because;

1. Alcohol helps you socialize, duh.
2. Ritaline keeps you energetic, awake.

When I go out without Ritaline, I find myself all sleepy and drowsy, and I usually call it a night and go home early after 4-5 beers, and even before I leave, I'm just not quiet there; I just feel tired, washed up, looking for excuses to go home, I do talk and crack jokes and shit for a short period of time where I force myself to feel energetic, but most of the time, I get bored and go to the toilet and sit there for 30 mins while my friends are partying or I just make up an excuse and get out, I feel like I don't have the energy. But, when I do take ritaline, which I do %90 of the time, ( I've been using it mostly to go out for the last 5 years, aside from it's occasional use it to work/ study) I am all energetic, I engage in convos, and become a person who is fun to be around with. People always called me a talkative, witty, full of energy, I'm usually the one who lifts up the spirits, cracking jokes, making people engage etc.

But, and this is a big but, and is esentially my question; I DON'T EVEN go out if drinking is not involved. I just don't want to. If we are not drinking, I just prefer staying home, watching movies, reading etc. Because when I go out for a simple coffee, meal or just casually hanging out, I just get bored, I can't bring myself to talk, start convos, or joke around. Even when something serious is talked about, I just can't bother the join, unless I'm really, really intrigued by that topic. I just sit there and wait people to go home, so can I. It's not that I don't like my friends or anything. It's just I lowkey get the fuck out so I can be home, comfortable watching random shit, jerking off, taking a shit, talking to myself etc. I always think to myself, ""I could be here, but drunk"", like, why would I go out and hang out without alcohol when I can get buzzed and enjoy and laugh etc. When I go out sober, I feel like I'm a shell of my 'would have really enjoyed this shit with a little buzz'-self, if that makes any sense. Because of this, I avoid any social activities during midweek, dumping friends, ignoring calls etc.

So, my question really comes down to this; who am I really ? Am I that energetic guy who makes people talk, who increases the energy, who lifts up the spirits, who opens up introvert people and make them engage in converastions ? Or am I just an introvert fella who can't go out without changing his brain chemistry ? I used to go out a lot in highschool, playing football, doing karaoke and shit, - before starting to drink, or taking any psychoactive substances-, but those times were like 10+ years ago.  
I don't even know whether I'm so dependent on alcohol and other shit that I can't even go out without them, or I have become depressed/introvert over time that drugs just help me go out. Who have I become really ? What should I do ?   


I know It's been a very long read, and I wish I would open up about this to people around me, but I just don't want to do that. I'm sick of those cliche, generic answers, that I haven't even bothered anymore for 5 years.

I recently took a large amount of thc with my friends. All three of them are experienced with this type of stuff, while I’m not and went into this dehydrated and haven’t eaten all day. As soon as it started to kick in everything started to repeat itself only once. For example I got off the chair, and i would get up and everything would repeat itself for about the last 3 seconds. I couldn’t walk, talk, or even really drink water. I felt like I would have to plan what movement I do 3 seconds in advance. The repeat slowly started to get faster, so that I would see much more everything for what felt like infinite amount of times, but it would still advance forward. At this point I told once of my friends that I needed to go inside and sit down (we were going to go swimming) and she immediately knew something was wrong because apparently I was completely pale, and sweating. She walked me to the couch and got me water, which I could barley drink because my coordination was terrible.  During this period of the trip I was complete trapped in this loop, and felt like I was running on autopilot even tho I was still completely conscious of what’s going on. I would focus really hard on slowing down the repeats, and it would help but it as if all I could focus on was that and I would give up and give it to the chaos. During this time I examined and questions every object, and it was as if I’ve never seen anything before. I saw my friends, which were at this point making me food and making sure I drank a lot of water and controlled my breathing, and I was perplexed to as what humans were. I saw their heads, their hands and body’s and thought about how all of it serves a purpose and was just fascinated as to why people look they way they do. This loop continued for three whole hours, the entire time my friends sat with me and helped. For three hours I constantly fought against the urge to give in completely and let the loop trap me in it for ever. At one point I thought that a alien and I switch consciousness and when I closed my eyes I saw myself slowly getting farther and farther away from a foreign planet, until eventually I saw my own eyeballs and myself go into them. Then The repeats started happening again, but slowly getting better. My friends asked if I was feeling better, and I kept saying “I’ll be fine in just one second” over and over for like 30 minds straight because I felt as if the loops were so close to stopping. Eventually i returned to normal without realizing it and from then of I was fine, but felt as if I saw everything that ever existed. I felt as if I had experienced everything. I eventually felt a sense of hopelessness because I had found the key to the universe and existence. The key to existence is nothing. Life and existence is predictable chaos. You’ve lived everything and everywhere, but at the same time your stuck living this life again.

Got some Xanax to help me out, 0.5 daily is what's recommended for newcomers, right? I've got around 20 2mg bars so looking to split em' up and use them throughout the month.

I understand a lot of you will be trying to look out for me and tell me that break-ups take time and to go to the gym or whatever but, honestly guys, I'm fed up. I'm living in hell and I was either gonna buy some Xanax or Heroin and I only chose the Xanax because more people post stories about being prescribed it after a break-up. 

I'm just looking for some advice on how to take this as safely as I can and make it as effective as possible. I have never taken benzos before, normally I only really use psychedelics and stimulants. I'm just looking to learn the basics - ie. how many days can I safely take 0.5mg of Xanax before getting reliant/having to taper off, and any other advice and info that you can't find online.

After a long day at work I just found out I close tomorrow when I thought I opened. I thought ""fuck it. I'm kinda tired and sore (I have chronic neck pain) but I wanna trip and it might be my last opportunity for a while. 

So I took it and sat back and waitedfor shit to happen. I was watching TV then decided I'd go for a walk and listento music because that seems to be what gets me going. I watched the clouds and the first real visuals started kicking in. They just looked like smoke and were super stringy(?). I started feeling my anxiety level rise and my neck pain getting a little worse but it was manageable.

I walked back home and tried to watch some anime. Some of the faces seemed a little more sinister,not in looks but just underlying feel. I started thinking a little too much and my neck pain was still getting worse. Finally I decided fuck it. Yup I'm a cheater. I took some klonopin (trip killer and also great for my pain problems) and just waited the 45 minutes to kick in. But.... Those were more of a test than I thought they would be.

Oddly enough, before i took the trip killers I wasn't having any anxiety/bad feelings i couldn't handle. Shortly after I took them.... Things got freaky. I looked down at my bathroom floorand started to see some of those swirling/fractal things on the tiles. I got dragged into it for a minute. Then it started happening everywhere I looked. I would begin to see a ridiculous amount of patterns and repeating patterns. The water drops on the wall all looked lime they would converge at one spot, or as if they were one, falli g at the same pace.

So.. I've had some run ins with psychosis and other problems in the past. One time ended up taking too much of a certain medicine and it made me start seeing the same pattern EVERYWHERE. It was always 3 dots, two eyes and a mouth. Look at the ground, the specs of dirt would make it (and so would all the ones next to it, sometimes mixing). Look at the grass. Somehow it would still be there. One of the worst times was a 2 month period where i was on the wrong antidepressant and it ended up making me go crazy. I legitimately thought people were after me. I wouldn't sleep for 3 days straight etc.

Back to the trip, as i was waitingfor the kpins to kick in I started getting some of those same feelings. The pattern recognition was too reminiscent of the medical complication i had yeara before. I began to feel boxed in and trapped like when I was on the wrong antidepressants. I started to question whether the klonopin would actually help, given my tolerance. I was very terrified for a minute, but I decided to do what i could, put my headphones in, listen to calm music, and walk down the road.

I listened to down by the seaside by led zeppelin and marveled at the amount of time it seemed to take to get from one street sign to the other. I was still feeling freaked out but just went with it. I decided if I was going insane I would accept it. Eventually the trip killers took effect... And here I am. There's no telling where I would be rn if I didn't have these. I could have caused myself some real trauma. I wasn't ready for what was coming.

So if anyone takes anything away from this, make sure you feel physically and mentally comfortable when you trip. Also, I know no one wants to feel like a ""cheater"" but it really is the best thing you can do for yourself to have trip killers (benzodiazepines (klonopin, Xanax, valium) and trazadone)

I tried many antidepressants, SSRIs, SSNRIs and other types: Escitalopram (Cipralex), Opipramol, Paroxetine, Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Bupropion (Wellbutrin), neuroleptics like Quetiapine (Seroquel), Promethazine and benzos like Diazepame (Valium) and Lorazepame (Tavor). Only think that worked for me are benzos. All other antidepressants didn't do anything for me except giving me side effects like making me very sleep, not sleeping at all, complete loss of appetite, increased anxiety and depression or sexual dysfunctions.

So things that work for me are phenibut, benzos and nitrous oxide (n2o/laughing gas). I didn't try anything else for now. Soon I'm going to try tilidine and let's see if this might be an opioid that works for me or if it's just another substance I'm non-respondent to.

What's the reason that drugs don't work for me. Any idea or suggestion? I'm 20 years old and I also suffer from mainly social anxiety and depression. The depression mainly comes from having social anxiety and it's consequences on life, health and cognition.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,685351,public,confidence,self,Drugs don't work for me,0,[],0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h79fkn/drugs_dont_work_for_me/,no_ads,0.0,1591947684.0,,,,,,,,,,1591920980.0,,,,,,,,,,,

Long story short 2 days before leaving for bootcamp I got injured and medically disqualified. I was heart broken As a coping tool ( stupid ik ) i smoked weed for about 2 weeks. Had 2 very bad highs and panic attacks. Now its hard to tell how much weed had to do with this but The military situation ( and possibly weed ) caused me to plummet into a 4 month ( still in it right now) debilitating depression &amp; anxiety shit show. I have severe anhedonia and cant work. Ik weed or other drugs can induce permanent psychosis but can it cause everlasting depression and anxiety?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,685329,public,confidence,self,Help!,0,[],0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h77i0a/help/,no_ads,0.0,1591941399.0,Cannabinoids,4186a904-9d47-11e5-a1ed-0e3238874433,Cannabinoids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Me and my friends were still in high school at the time, and one of them started interacting with the so called dark web, me and my friends nicknamed him Lester, in reference to GTA 5, due to his appearance and computer skills. Like most high schoolers it simply started with ordering weed, however after about six months of smoking cannabis 3 of them wanted to try psychedelics. It became clear to us that LSD would be safest and easiest hallucinogenic to receive by post. We all tripped together at least 5 or six times before the BAD TRIP happened. My first trip was absolutely amazing, I took 200 ug and it was absolutely incredible, I was in shock that something like this actually existed, and I kept asking myself why doesn’t everyone do this at least once in their life, how couldn’t you? To cut a long story short, after my first trip I did five or six smaller trips ranging from doses of 100 - 250ug. It’s important to note that all my my buddy’s enjoyed their trips and not one of us ever had a bad trip. From the geometric patterns to the morphing, we were relatively confident with tripping, however we were probably doing it too frequently. Unknown to any of us at the time, we’d never take it again after a very scary experience which could of ended much worse than it did.

So... me and my buddy’s were sitting in our music technology class at school making music for our projects in the studio, and ‘lester’ says, I saw an amazing deal on ABAY last night, I reply “ is that right” and our half Albanian friend says, “you know what, let’s order them and trip balls this weekend”. Despite him only even taking one tab dosed at 100ug. The weekend comes around quickly, and without surprise the tabs arrived on time for Saturday night. Our friend nicknamed t, suggested for us to stay at his house that night because his mum wasn’t in. He lives in a massive farm with a lot of open space and privacy, so we thought it was the perfect place to trip. We all arrived at his house for 3 pm, relaxing and smoking no drama no drama. Then, lester opens up his bag and says “ are you guys ready for this shit”, we all look at him and say yeah let’s go. We all planned in school to take 3 tabs tach which was the equivalent of just over 300ug. It could of been more, he wasn’t too clear on the dose which is another mistake we made. Anyway, we all dropped the acid and put it under our tongues for 15 minutes. Despite our recommendation for our buddy’s to stop smoking they kept piping away. After about 30 minutes, we started to feel high and energetic, nothing out of the ordinary. Within 45 minutes mild visuals start, dimmed colours and a slightly fuzzy effect which we hadn’t experienced before. We were all calm and collected until an hour and a half passed and the trip went from 1-100 real quick. The come-up was overwhelming, we all started to feel anxious and hot. We knew that it was far more intense than anything we’d ever experienced before, at such an early stage we knew we were fucked no questions asked. At the two hour mark, the hallucinations were beyond intense, everything felt like a cartoon or a movie, almost like nothing was real, and we had to act in front of a fake audience.The walls looked like they were crisping like a dried painting, we were far from a perceptional reality. At this point we are all walking around talking to ourselves, I keep saying “ let’s go for a walk let’s go for a walk” it became a never ending thought loop. It felt like we were being suffocated in a melting room, it was getting more intense by the minute. At this stage, our Albanian friend starts screaming “ it’s okay go with him Haleigh” he thought he was Eminem shouting at the top of his lungs. While we were all sitting down and trying to grip onto reality. 5 minutes later, Eminem came to the conclusion that we were all having a bad trip and starts screaming in our faces and punches t’s television and mashes it into pieces. At this point, we were all freaking out badly. To make matters worse. He started to punch t in the face for trying to pin him down, he landed a good punch and t was bleeding from the nose heavily, with blood dripping everywhere it made the trip even worse. We were all telling him to sit down which didn’t work so we pinned him down and zip tied him. We quickly called t’s mum to the house, explaining that we were all having an extremely bad trip which was spiralling out of control. T was cleaning the blood off his face at his kitchen sink and we both looked at each other in shock. Despite the fact that we were all experiencing ego death, we still had a reserve of reality up there somewhere, and we started to comfort each other a little bit. His face quickly dropped when he saw a police van and an ambulance coming up his driveway, his mum had called for an ambulance to take our friend who had lost control because his heart rate was also exceeding a safe sustainable rate. Unfortunately the police came for backup. Word quickly spreads to our parents and Eminem’s mum comes to the scene to comfort him. The police took a statement and searched for cannabis just doing their checks but thankfully we smoked it all. One of my friends told the police false information and we all started laughing, keep in mind we were all still in a cartoon like reality not fully understanding what was going on and if it was even real if that makes any sense. I look over to my Albanian friend who’s actually my best friend, he was crying on the sofa with his mum, and I just see tears like I’ve never seen them before, we both looked at each other in a way I’ve never looked at another human being, it was like looking at a creature who had just made the biggest mistake of his life. He was taken to the hospital and the police took the rest of us home. My friends said it felt like there was blood all over their bodies when there wasn’t, and we were all convinced that someone was killed before the police came. It actually felt like I was bleeding when I wasn’t it was so weird. To this day we still find it hard to believe how quickly the trip went, by the time the police had arrived we’d been tripping for about 7 hours, we still don’t fully remember all the details from the night. The worst part for me was ego death, not being able to fully recognise my friends and reality was certainly scary and not something I want to experience ever again.

For those reading this, try to be sensible with acid. It’s a very powerful drug, only take it with people you trust and like, and keep the dose low if anything ! It’s hard to explain the trip in detail as you need to see it to believe it, seeing is believing as they say, or as I like to say believing is seeing. It’s been a long time since I’ve taken LSD and I don’t plan on taking it again, it certainly has its positives and negatives. The clear positives for me are simple, it opens your eyes to the bigger picture in life, a different sense of connection can be experience with other people and the environment around you, it can also make you feel refreshed in some ways. I felt like it also helped me notice the emotions of others around me easier too. However you can only trip so much in my eyes, and the more you do it, your not going to learn much more than you did from the last trip, your only as good as your last job right ?There’s negatives too , despite the obvious bad trip, acid can make you over think stupid things that aren’t worth worrying about at all, and I mean stupid things ! It can also make you depressed, after our bad trip one of my friends was depressed for months, I’m sure you can guess who. I’ll openly say that I’m much more confident now that I don’t take it anymore and I don’t overthink small problems which can easily become bigger problems. A bad trip happens when it needs to happen folks ! Have a good one.

I smoke weed daily, but i wouldn't say this a perfect escape drug, it makes me happy being bored when i have nothing to do but usually makes my mind think about whatever im trying to escape too much

MDMA is close to what im after, but i get major bad comedown and spend the next 3 days pretty depressed so the low's outweigh the highs imo. 

Ketamine is great, but its pretty obvious to other people around you that your fucked up on something

I reckon most people are going to say something like heroin. Which is probably exactly what im after, but i will never try it. Same with other hard drugs.

I'm twenty two, been in chronic pain for the last 2-3 years and finally accepting that it's only going to get worse. My doctor recently put me on a long term dilly prescription and I can't fucking believe how long and how much pain I was in. Low key feels like I was locked out of my house for the last two years.

&amp;#x200B;

My current RX list is

2g's of weed per day, which doesn't really do shit for osteoarthritis. With the introduction of hydro, my consumption is actually true to my RX and I'm not smoking an 1/8 a day anymore, which is doing wonders for my mental condition.

10mg hydromorphone. I've only had this rx for a month and a week at this dosage, but it's pretty much given me my life back. I'm taking 2mg orally every couple hours. I really fucking like to get high so I'm trying to limit how often I snort to the weekends or if I'm completely overwhelmed by pain.

&amp;#x200B;

800mg of gabatine. Calms the sciatic pain and acts as an intermideary between the remless dream state of weed and the opiate river that can be unraveling at times.

&amp;#x200B;

At this dose, I think I'll have to snort my dilly's when I'm djjing/performing, which I'm not too keen on. So I plan on getting my dosage upped in the next couple of months.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been waking up to weird nausea the last couple days, and I figure that's because of the hydro jump. But after a small bowl and a shit, I feel aight. But it's worth it. Doing yoga while not being in pain is the shit, being able to dance for longer than twenty minutes is the shit, being able to throw parties again's going to be the shit. IDK how I let my self loose two years of my life to pain.

&amp;#x200B;

To preface the situation, I was prescribed the antipsychotic risperdal when I was 13 following a few years at a heavily abusive christian private school where I was bullied by my peers and teachers. Due to my experience at this institution I became extremely isolated and nearly mute at school, only speaking when I had finally had enough of my peers constantly telling me that God would never love me so I should just kill myself and that I'm a horrible person unworthy of salvation because I questioned the pastor in bible class. My muteness, alongside lashing out and yelling at my peers after months of verbal abuse prompted the Asperger's diagnosis and prescription of risperidal by a church affiliated psychologist. I was still on risperdal for years after I managed to convince my parents to take me out of the toxic school situation. After time away from it I slowly began to speak to people other than my family and started to no longer fear those of my own age group and I developed strong friendships that last to this day. Then when I was about 18 I dove hard into hippie shit and the music of the grateful dead, the doors, pink floys etc... and I found alot of artistic inspiration in their music. I've always been naturally artistically inclined, doing many paintings, sketches and marker works over my teenage years as a way to process and cope with my emotions. A culmination of constant hippie music, art and a desire to know the unknown led me to *try* some LSD I got from a kind deadhead friend. I took half the tab with the intention of painting and opening new doors both artistically and emotionally and I was so excited to have a profound and meaningful experience but as time went on all my friends were vibin' and having a great time with it and I was still stone cold sober. That night left me wondering what was so wrong with my brain that I couldn't even have a meaningful psychedelic experience which led me to do extensive research as to the reason it all panned out like that. I didn't realize it was the risperdal at first, it honestly took me a year to realize that's what robbed me of the journey I was looking for a year before, yet when I did the realization completely changed my perspective on my own mental health. I made a very conscious decision to stop taking the medication, taking nearly a month and a half to ween myself off it yet still experiencing horrendous side effects the entire time, mainly lethargy, body pain, extremely prevalent suicidal thoughts and waves of mild low-key pretty visual hallucinations. I have now been off risperdal for a lil over 2 years now and I constantly suffer from moderate to severe depression and I feel as if I lost part of myself to that drug. Do any of y'all have any insight on the long term effects on mental health even years after detoxing from risperdal? I know it affects your seritonin and dopamine receptors so I'm wondering if I have permanent damage to them which may be causing my depression? I also have been very curious if I will ever be able to take LSD and get the introspective artistic experience I was looking forward to many years ago or if the 6 years of risperidal have robbed my mind of ever having that profound experience I wanted so badly. Sorry it's alot, I've just been thinking alot about my mental health recently, thanks for reading and I greatly appreciate all feed back y'all may have.

Do you have to ease off of it like other drugs or can you just suddenly stop taking them completely. 
•If you CAN just stop taking them completely (which I’m sure I know the answer), will you have bad withdrawals? 
{Like I said I’m sure I know cause I’ve had withdrawals before but at that time I didn’t really try to quit. It was pretty much the start of me doing them, when I first started doing them 1 or more times a week and gradually turning into multiple times a week. BUT, at that time.. 
IT - WAS - THEE - worst! I was so sick that I didn’t leave the room I was staying in for days besides occasionally grabbing a plate of food someone had made for me though most of the time I couldn’t even eat it just had to force myself to eat at least a few bites and the only way I could sleep is if I took a bit of Xanax to knock me out.It was mainly the subutex pills I was using then..The strips used to make me so sick almost every time. But eventually, and by eventually I mean up until about 6 months ago or so, I switched to the 8mg Suboxone strips only due to the fact that my guy couldn’t get the pills anymore. And by the time I found someone getting them, I needed pretty much a whole entire pill to get high, compared to literally the tiniest amount I used to need.. which was for real the size of 1/4 to half a pea. And oddly enough, that small amount needed lasted for the longest time.. even with the gradually increasing frequency of my uses, went on for over 6 months.}     {Also keep in mind that I was doing them for no more than 2 weeks, like every other day or so. But not long after that, I continued.. fast forwarding all the way to now, with a starting dose of (only needing) 1-2mg turned into the current 12-16mg (2 whole strips] .. and 12 is if I snort it (which I never will again.) 
And that huge jump happened in just the past 2-3 months from needed 3-4mg in the beginning of it. So out of all that time, (over a year), I just NOW started to get into ridiculously high doses. I’m saying that 2-3 months ago I could’ve just done 3mg and be super euphoric where I want to be. Now at the 2 strip mark I don’t feel much. My last dose, which is 14mg total was today. I felt good euphoria for maybe half hour but still was nothing special. And that’s with:
1.)Taking 5mg orally (sublingual)
2.)Snorting 4mg (dissolved in water)             And-
3.)Boofing 5mg (Recrum administration), which by the way was only my 3rd time [first two times were failed attempts, leaked out.] 
It was stupid especially for me but my tolerance is up so high I decided to do it all, and even with ALL those ROAs... NOTHING! Well besides hours later feeling sick, panic attack-y, puking multiple waterfalls, failing to eat, major headache, difficulty breathing, ect.. also for some reason was uncontrollably hiccuping super bad up until now where I finally feel somewhat better.
Anyway I’m not complaining about my tolerance but rather informing you of all my current situation to receive the best answers.

Questions:
1.) Am I able to just quit like that.. ORRRR...
 Do I have to ease off of the drug??
2.) In either cases, how shitty will I feel, if at all?
3.) And how long would the WD’s last??
3.) What is your advice/techniques on the best way to go about this? Because I actually AM serious about quitting this time. Been stalling it for a while but I’m tired of feeling this level of shit, even if it isn’t all the time.. the feeling is just NOT worth it.

The reason I even do it in the first place is because it gives me confidence, major decrease in anxiety and euphoria. But mainly those first two.. so if the WD’s are real bad there’s no way I’ll be able to get through it. I already have severe anxiety and mental health issues involving mainly depression and shit like that.

Line was real skinny, maybe 3 inches long. It took me 2 tries to finish it and I had just one. I’d estimate maybe 0.125g on the high end, but that was just eyeballing. I’m here because the only info I can find online about coming down is for people who went on a binge and smoked/snorted etc for days at a time. This was one line one time, haven’t done addys or anything like it in 6 or so months. I have previous experience with stims (your common pharmaceuticals and cocaine, and one time crack. the comedown from crack was so horrible i never touched it again), having comfortably handled doses up to about 75 mg. Also dabbled in some opiates, lots of hallucinogenics &amp; i love my girl MJ. Wasn’t too worried about not handling it well, not my first rodeo with some stronger stuff. 
WELL. I’m coming up on 24 hours now. Been nauseous, uncomfortable, janky, shaking, terrible heartburn for at least 12 hours. No sleep.  I’m so exhausted. I know logically that I am not in any real serious danger, but I feel like I’m dying slowly. This is insanely miserable, unlike any other comedown I’ve ever experienced. I’ve just been praying for it to be over. I’ve been drinking tons of water, forced myself to eat, had some nice sex with the BF, smoked some good THC shatter, and still feel like I’m going to vibrate apart any second. Please guys, I’m real scared and any advice would be so nice.

Edit for clarification: I was out of town with a girlfriend, there are no stimulants in my home at this time and I have no way to find/purchase more, nor do I have any desire to. I just want to be sober again ASAP.

edit again: oh my god, you guys, please stop trying to solicit me in my inbox. i am in a committed and loving relationship. i feel like shit, i am way past the horny stage of this experience, and you can do so much better!

was on very potent edibles, one person was on benzydamine, one person was candy flipping and two others were smoking PCP infused tea leaves. We’re all aged 15-16 an a little advice don’t let 8 people inexperienced with drugs all do hard drugs together (although it’s kinda common sense that that’s a recipe for disaster), this was incredibly funny, hard work and scary. People had bad trips, great trips and mixed, I’m lucky no one got hurt to be fair and I feel for people who run childcare.

We were all in my friends house and it was like looking after little kids, the benzydamine kid was fully delirious and was freaking out the people doing LSD, thankfully one was experienced and calmed the other too down while me and my friend helped the kid on benzydamine (why tf can he never pick a normal drug ) he kept trying steal all the cutlery and was talking to non existent people

At this point my closest friend is fully rolling hard now while the LSD people are fully tripping but their getting anxious so I send the guy on MDMA to vibe with them (he’s a god send as him loving everyone, can calm people down who are having a bad trip). 

Next I look out the window to see the people on pcp fully playing leap frog (like wtf), so my friend goes to get them while the kid on edibles (very inexperienced drug user) is really panicking saying that he’s dying and that the edibles must be spiked with something.

This spreads panic through the whole room.

At this point I’m worried we can’t control everyone and it’s going bad, so I’m on the phone to someone to get Xanaxs to abort the trip, while my friend starts locking doors to make sure know one runs of. This is when a kid on acid just shouts “they’re locking us in” and they all just go quiet and look at us until the delirious kid says “this KFC is taking forever” (he genuinely had been waiting on a KFC order for like 10mins now, thought I was a a waiter an I just went with it), anyway everyone just begins to laugh so hard they’re almost crying. Me and my friend just look at each other, uncomfortable with the insanity of everyone and how there trips change from good to bad at the flip of a switch.

People are panicking on and off so we decide to partner people into twos and put them in separate rooms because as a group they are more out of reality and do far more damage. We stay with the delirium kid, who wants to know how he ended up in my house (wasn’t my house) and the MDMA guy is too hyper to go in one room. The PCP people go together, the experienced LSD user and a non experienced one and the edible kid and another acid guy. All in the hope these pairings would calm people down.

This was a terrible idea everyone got the idea they were in prison and we were the guards but we couldn’t be concerned by that as the delirium kid thinks he’s slashing at imaginary attackers and was going crazy and damaging the house (says he doesn’t remember doing this). My friend goes to get a drink for the delirium guy as he’s complaining about dry mouth, when he is confronted by everyone demanding for the key so they can “escape”, so naturally my friend gave them his school locker key.

I’m an alright trip sitter but this was insane and it’s not even possible to talk someone down who’s delirious 

Issue was everyone was a 10/10 fucked (accept deliriant kid he was 15/10) and they were all relatively in experienced and everyone is in different moods. It made them impossible to control but after a while we managed to get all the LSD people all in one room and got them watching trippy videos on YT and eventually the PCP guys were playing GTA after I refused to let them play darts in the house (it’s not fun being kill joy). People generally got calmer as the night went on, accept deliriant kid he stayed delirious for ages.

Could of gone much worse all in all and I’m kinda sad I was sober as it looked quite fun, delirant guy took ages to sober up and got really scared towards the end, he now has HPPD. The edibles guy is a little traumatised and the biggest mystery of all was all the food was gone from the fridge (like 90% of the stuff), we looked everywhere and the edibles guy said he only cooked a pizza, which I never saw and no one else remembers eating anything. If the neighbours had called the police I don’t know what I would of done

Anyway I just thought that was a crazy story, had to make a whole new reddit account to so people don’t see it on my mains feed, thanks for reading

Edit: ignore my comments on MDMA, I’ve been told it’s incorrect and I’m sorry for spreading misinformation and I never thought it would blow up so I am rushing to rply to comments an possibly making mistakes, sorry again

Like Eminem’s story goes, my mother used to feed me pills. She gave me my first benzo in grade 3 because I told her I was “...too scared to talk in front of the class”, and from then on I was subjected to and also abused, these drugs, at least until I became a teenager. 
Anyway, fast forward years later, when I was nearly considered a what-should-be a responsible adult (21), I was still using a large amount of drugs, from meth to weed, to any pharmaceutical you could name of (Xanax to methylphenidate, dexies, to lorazepam etc) and then one day I realised, not only am I chasing the dragon, hiding my emotions and/or running from my past, enjoy getting high and understand ing something ‘normal’ people don’t understand is that I realised:

I’m using drugs because I blame my parents. Ever since I was a kid I blamed my parents for the problems in my life. I used to go off at my dad and mum for not showing me enough love, when in fact they were, I just didn’t see it. I used to go off when they would tell me to do chores, they would go off when I refused to behave in general. The only thing is, I can’t tell if that all happened because &gt;I&lt; was on drugs, or because my parents were.
I use drugs because I blame my parents. It’s their fault for at least just drugs, and whatever happens to me either on or off drugs is THEIR fault. That’s what a lot of teenagers and kids I’ve met seem to believe, and carry out traditions which I think are directly related to the  problem. They glorify it. 

What some people need to understand is that they’re not getting back on society or family members by using drugs, getting low grades, being little shits etc, they’re getting back at themselves and the world that supports them, by not showing appreciation for what is provided for them, even if it is drugs. 

I believed for 10 years that I was using drugs because I deserved them, and that I was on them to not only to help me but also kill me, in order to prove that my grandpa/mum/dad didn’t know what he was talking about. 

I regret ever starting drugs, but even after 11 years I still see the beauty that comes with any high, and am in love with dreams, the fact that I can control ever character in these dreams except my real-life self, is incredible, if not mesmerising. Drugs have show me things that no single person on this Earth would believe. But  (The dreams, which must be real or I wouldn’t be able to experience them and then going forward even experience this text) means that drugs, from LSD to methamphetamine, and hallucinations that come with prolonged or instant use of these drugs, must be real, at least somewhere in the universe, because if the universe makes something it must exist, especially since matter “Can’t be created or destroyed”, or our brains, which are real and exist in the universe, wouldn’t be able to even process hallucinations etc and then understand it and process it in a way that we are aware of as a part of the universe. This gives way to the fact that some people can see their imaginations applied to the world around them because if you imagine something, then it can be, at least somewhere in the universe, real, or once again, we wouldn’t even be able to process it, in that the imagination is processed by our brains, which exist and are real in the universe (Because if not then we/I/you wouldn’t be experiencing this) and also that almost anything that alters our perception exists somewhere in the universe. I mean, how do you know that a billion light years from Earth exists a space station that houses magical creatures. A normal human can’t process this, we can only go off what we’re taught and technology we’re exposed to from the government. Who teaches us from the beginning? The government. Who teaches us what is right and wrong? The government. What’s the biggest gang in the world? The government 
Who is above the law because they can create or destroy their own laws? The government.
Who dictates who we get to vote between even tho it’s only always two party’s that we get to choose from? The highest level of the government.

Well, addiction, is the opposite. As you sink deeper into destructive patters, people start to drift away - loved ones, friends, even family, if you dive to the very bottom of the ocean of destruction.

What pains me aren't those whomst don't understand and don't listen. You cannot change others - especially if they think your addiction is a moral failing on your part.

No. Not them. It's the people you know will love you if you tell then you relapsed. They won't be angry, but reassuring. They won't tell you how to live, but they will listen to how you live.

I did probably about 300mg in one line (which is normal for me) and it seemed like while almost k holing, I felt as though I had some sort of manic episode or something, with my brain going 100mph just thinking about things. I can't quite put my finger on what happened. It quickly settled whatever it was, and I fell asleep pretty easily. 

When I woke up the next day I had very intense brain fog and anxiety, and these symptoms haven't left. When I first wake up every morning I feel back to normal again, but then a tingly/fuzzy feeling comes across my body and my head starts to hurt again. My brain feels like it's going at 100mph while not actually thinking of anything. I can't think very straight, am quite irritable and find it kind of hard to talk to people now.

I still eat well and run every morning, been out for walks most afternoons, but I just can't seem to get my head back to normal, so am coming to you guys to see if there's anyone who has experienced anything similar, or if anyone can shed some light on this?

4 years ago, when I was 17, I came to this thread, full of fear, shame and hopelessness about my meth use. Even as a recreational user (I wasn’t a full blown addict), I sincerely believed I was doomed, especially being so young. And there while some people in this community definitely augmented my fears, a lot of you were immensely supportive. 

Well, flash forward and today I’m 4 years meth free! I’m not completely sober but would definitely say I more “responsible” relationship with drugs and alcohol (a lil bit of pot here and there and a drink not too often). 

If you happen to be reading this and find yourself in a similar situation, I think the best thing you can do is try and get out before it’s too late. Meth addiction only gets progressively worse over time. Talk to someone- family, mental health professional, etc-and see what treatment options are out there. Even though I thought it was bullshit at the time, I think I learned a lot in the long run from outpatient treatment and being held accountable for not using. 

Hang in there. Cravings are a bitch. Even as a very light user, I remember for the first ~6 months-year having dreams about using and having cravings that lasted all day. But now I barely remember what it’s like to use.

It is mainly HOT-17 and LSD though which have drastically changed my life. Many people think that due to psychedelic use I have just gone insane to an extent, I like to think it helped me change my life for the better. I wouldn’t of imagined this would happen a few months ago

I used to be a heroin, coke, Valium and ket dealer and I was also a certified guy, people generally wouldn’t mess with me. I was making money (a lot), had a few guys working for me and despite a few set backs I was at the top of my game. I brought in various new ideas to the group, to home cook the heroin and new territory to sell to, I incorporated the darknet, etc. I became the right hand man of the leader of the group and I had everything going for me. I started of not being able to afford school uniform and food and ended up making more than my parents. I was stabbed once, stopped selling only to return and even the scoreboard as quickly as I left.

Recently the group leader was arrested on a lot of charges, so a new boss was required. In all fairness though I don’t have the contacts and expertise to run the whole group but I could definitely take left over product and a few of the key workers and made a break a away group

Anyway I’m going of topic, I’ve always been interested in psychedelics and had waited a long time to try a high dose of LSD, like 600ug+ and this quarantine gave me the opportunity, so I brought a 10 strip of the darknet from a verified vendor, with each tab being 200ug each. 

After this trip slowly I’ve began to realise I’m not interested in power or money anymore which feels like a borderline personality disorder for me because that’s what’s always driven me. I feel sad for the people who lose their lives to ride outs and the people who go pen for 20 years. I honestly think I was a little bit of a sociopath until recently as I did not care who got hurt in my pursuit of money.

I actually help various drug addicts I know now and rob dealers who are rumoured to cut product with fentanyl, my friend told me not to do this as apparently heroin addicts rate fentanyl 

I know they say LSD can change perspective but this is something else I feel like it’s changed my personality but I am contempt with how it’s changed it as in the long term dealing probably would of backfired. Although I still sell DMT, I don’t sell quite on the same scale as before.

Does psychedelics effect everyone to this extent ? Or possibly because I’m younger and wanted to change my lifestyle I don’t know but I always believe people greatly exaggerated the long term benefits of psychedelics. I even brought a dog recently, I would of never done that before.

I am not feeling any negative side effects except from flushing on my face, a blocked nose and feeling hot.

Would it be safe for me to take the 50mg bomb of MKAT? Would it have the same effects as when snorting it or is it different?

Took my first Sertraline yesterday and so far I’m not a fan, I know it can take a week or two to start getting back to normal but I’m yet to sleep a wink. (Almost 07:30 in the uk, went to bed early). 

It feels like being on stims without any high. Heart rate elevated, somehow exhausted but feel wide awake as if it’s midday after a good sleep, can’t concentrate on anything because I’m too busy concentrating on nothing etc

Anyone else had this? I got started on 50mg and wondering if I should half the next dose (due in a few hours) or wait it out for a week or so? Normally I’d phone the doctors but with covid I don’t want to add unnecessary strain to them when I’ve already been in contact multiple times a week for the last couple of months.

Hospitals all smell the same. It’s a mixture of the bad food and people and whatnot. There are also the astringent, antiseptic cleaners they use to keep the place from being overrun with infectious disease and the deodorizers they use to try to cover up the misery, like a thin skin draped over the stink of death and suffering and the terrible news that people get in places like that, when all of their power and money and popularity has been stripped away from them and they are reduced to breathing in that hospital room smell and broken hearted weeping and sickness and the same terrible, eternal fate as everyone else, asking themselves what kind of lives they have lived, faced with the ultimate humility.

I’ve woken up in a lot of hospitals over the years for lots of different reasons. Overdoses. Infections. Withdrawals. Psychotic breaks. For the first few years of my IV drug use, I went to the hospital no less than once a month. Usually more than that, but you get to know the smell well, because they all smell the same.

And now I’m waking up. Machines are beeping, and some tape is painfully pulling at the hair on the back of my hand. My eyes are still closed, and my mouth is dry, so stick my tongue out and lick my lips. The lips get stuck the skin on my face, and someone is shuffling around the room. Hard plastic wheels roll across the floor. A machine beeps. Velcro straps are ripped apart, and soft, female voice speaks out,

“Are you awake?”

“Who wants to know?”

“My name is Ellen. I’m your nurse.”

“Nurse, huh?”

“Yes. Your nurse.”

“I knew I was in a hospital.”

“You are. How do you feel?”

“I feel like the two-party system is unfair to us as Americans, besides being an inaccurate representation of all the ideas that unite us as a people or the different groups that could exist, instead of the two bogus platforms we’ve got. I feel like collecting rainwater and growing my own vegetables is ideal and I feel like the public education system is a failure. I feel like I was denied the privilege of going through the traditional tribal rites of passage that young men have always had as a way of knowing that they had become and were indeed men at last, and I feel like that has been a great detriment to me in my life as I’ve stumbled to find myself, to find a purpose and confidence.”

“Funny.”

“You asked me how I feel.”

“You’ve been out since I’ve been on shift. Do you feel okay? Maybe, the medicine is at too high of a dosage.”

“You tell me,” I say and open my mouth rudely, “You’re the professional here.”

There’s some quiet shifting of her weight and the rustle of her scrubs on my mattress and her shoes moving on the floor.

“Looks like it, mister. Are you ready to open your eyes?”

“Is it bright?”

“No. Not bad.”

I open my eyes. The nurse is much younger than her voice made me think she was. Now, she’s reaching over and sliding a black cuff up my arm to take my blood pressure.

“Here.” She says. “Let’s get your blood pressure.”

“A sphygmomanometer, huh?” I smile.

“I’ve never heard anyone call it that before.”

“I like words and things, but people? Not so much.”

“Oh.” She says somberly. “You’re having fun, aren’t you?”

“What happened?” I ask. “Everything was burning down and crumbling around me and something terrible was happening, but I can’t remember what it is.”

“Do you know where you are?”

“I mean, the hospital, right?”

“You had a heart attack.”

And in an instant, the whole of it comes rushing back to me. My heart reels, as I remember about Beth and the girls and Milagros. The nurse finishes taking my vitals and gives me a small cup of pills which she tells me to take and says she’ll be back in a few hours.

“Press the button if you need anything,” she says and is gone. Whatever she gave me kicks in, and my worries leave me, and sleep is easy.

In the morning, Ruben and his mother and Milly wake me up. Milly carries the baby and Olivia runs in to see me screaming about how much she loves her daddy. It’s a great moment. Ruben laughs and makes fun of me, reenacting the phone call from Milagros.

“Yeah, bro, she all calls me up. Says, ‘Hey, cousin, um, I think Donny is not doing so good.’”

“I say, ‘Oh, yeah, cousin? What makes you say that?’”

“She says, ‘Well, he is either sleeping on the ground by his van in the driveway or something’s wrong.’”

“And so, I say, ‘Yeah, Milly. Do me a favor. Hang up the phone. Call 911 and tell them, either he’s asleep in the dirt outside or he needs to go to the hospital. I don’t know Donny that well, but I’m pretty sure he never took a nap in the dirt before.’”

The way he’s telling it, the expressions on his face, the accent he gives himself in the account and his impression of Milagros makes everyone laugh so hard that our eyes water. His mother has to wipe her eye. Olivia laughs like she knows what’s funny in the first place, even though she doesn’t. Even the little one giggles a bit. And that sets us all to laughing again.

“Look, man. You know it’s bad when the little baby is laughing at you!” Ruben says.

“Yeah.” And now I look down at Olivia and ask her what she’s been doing at Milly’s. She jumps up and down and screams about chocolate chip cookies and something about flying and playing with birds in her broken toddler language.

After that the baby slobbers on me from Milly’s arms and puts her mouth on my chin and spits up. Milly assures me it’s no problem, that she’s happy to help. Ruben makes some more jokes and sits around talking about work. His mom tells me she’ll bring me something to eat this evening when they come, and so after an hour or two, they all leave, so the doctor can talk to me. He has dry skin and glasses and wears cowboy boots under his white coat, as he tells me about the thinners he’s got me on and how it seems like it’s one of the most minor heart attacks a person can have, that I don’t need to worry. We talk about my stool for a moment and things to look out for and how he’s going to keep me for at least one more day, before I get to go.

Milagros picks me up on the day I get wheeled out to the front of Holy Cross Hospital. She drives me in her own car to the trailer. Stops to buy milk and some other groceries at the store. It’s the two of us and no one else. Inside of the house, the thin wristed woman wets rags in the sink and wipes down the counters and tables and heats up a meal of leftover chicken and rice for me. Does a load of laundry and dishes. Carries the rattling orange pill bottles to the the bathroom. Places them in the cabinet and scrubs the sink and toilet after that, even sprays and cleans the floor with an old towel. I stare at the wall, leaned back in the recliner.

Milly’s forehead shines at me in the corner of my eye when she thinks I’m not looking, her caramel colored skin. Her mouth smiles at me as she takes the plate from my hands. She has this pitting in her cheeks and on her nose make it look like parts of her face were grated off, but it doesn’t take away from her. It makes her prettier. The problem is that I’m morbidly depressed and apparently recovering from a heart attack early in life, but she doesn’t seem to mind. Thing is, though, she deserves better.

She stares out of the window in the kitchen, the way Beth used to when things were good, when I would come up behind her and grab her to kiss her before work, and a while later, Milly pulls the clothes out of the washer and puts them into the dryer. Finishes putting up the dishes. Straightens the chairs and table and everything else. Finally, she puts her things together and tells me to call her if I need anything and leaves me in the dark, there.

It’s quiet, quieter than it’s been for me in well over a year, since the last night I spent at the house in Olympia by myself. No kids. No Beth. No TV playing, and it’s nice. And hours pass like that. Nothing happens as I sit there thinking about all of it and reflecting on my own family, wondering if why this was why my father drank, because the weight is so heavy. It rains. First, a few thumps of heavy drops on the foil roof of the trailer and cheap windows. Then, a steady roar of heavy downpour. And I step outside and drift into a mindless meditation on the world at work at night.

Rain splashes in clouded dust puddles next to the railroad ties out front. It’s loud. A pair of headlights passes by on its way to another trailer. Blue flashes reveal the distant, alien crags or flat-topped mesa or tortoise shell mountains of the New Mexican geology on the horizon of the land. Fat white flowers and the lavender lilac blooms hang heavy on their branches along the fence, saturated and dripping fat drops of rain water. It’s electric, and when I sit back down inside, it’s over.

It’s surreal, these moments before the strange visitation. And now, a pair of bare feet scuff the mud outside. One foot slaps a puddle. There’s a scratching at the far window, the one Milly looked out of some hours earlier. And a pair of blackened, desperate eyes peer back in at me from outside. It’s Beth, and she sneaks to the door, having not seen me and turns the knob and slinks in.

“What are you doing here?”

Both of her feet come off the ground, she spooks so badly.

“Donny?”

“Yeah.”

“I didn’t think you were here.” She’s facing me. Shifts her weight from one hip and foot back over to the other and scratches her elbow. And rubs her thigh in the dark.

“Are you hungry?” The question surprises me as much as it does her. I’m not sure why. Maybe, kindness isn’t what I expected show her. But our separation and my despair, until now, has been bloodless. Has had no teeth or skin, relegated to an existence of amorphous writhing, a shapeless shimmering in black recesses, but now the wet and haggard frame of the girl I love, the mother of my child—our children—is flesh before me.

“Starving,” she says and puts a finger to her mouth. Holds her chin for a second and jerks it away.

“Open the fridge. Get some cereal. Whatever you want.”

She moves over to the far corner of the kitchen, and I stand to turn on the light. A pair of fitted jeans with intricate silver lacing on the back pockets. It looks weird on her. Brand new her jeans would cost upwards of 200 dollars, and they’re certainly nothing she would have ever bought before and not anything she ever owned when we were together, but in the kitchen light, she is all wet and the bottoms of the jeans are soaked in dirty water. Denim strands hang off the back where she dragged her heals, and she’s tracking blood on the linoleum from a what has to be a cut on her foot. Her tank top is stained in what looks like blood. There’s a big grey leather purse—the kind old ladies wear—hanging from her shoulder. The sight of her, the chemical fidget in her movements and the humiliation in her face makes me turn the lights back off, hoping to spare her the embarrassment.

“You want to shower first?”

“Yeah,” she admits, and for a second, I recognize that she is Olivia’s mother by the way she says it.

“Okay. Get in there. I’ll throw some clothes in there for you. Let me know if you need a towel. Should be one in there.”

While the water runs and the bathroom fills with steam, I turn the lights on and sit down at the table, weakened by the moment. To have her back at last is everything I’ve wanted so badly for so long now that I can’t believe it and don’t know how to deal with her, and she comes out wearing clean clothes and sits at the table. I get up and make a bowl of cereal for her. She shovels it into her mouth and gasps for air between chewing and slurps up the milk from the bowl. Doesn’t say a word. Pours another one and devours it. Tilts the bowl back with the nicotine stains and raw knuckled fingers to drink the milk. Pours another one. These are big bowls, and halfway through the third one, she pushes it away from herself. Leans back and pats her belly and burps.

“Look,” she says and holds teeth apart from each other, so I can see her tongue.

“What’s that?”

“You can’t see it? On my tongue.”

“Oh yeah.”

It’s a purple divot she seems to be nursing as she speaks, saying,

“It hurts. These freaking Fruit Loops just tore up my mouth,” and we laugh together.

Afterwards, I get her some covers and let her sit on the recliner. The sun is coming up, but it’s still dark. Her shampoo smells up the house. It’s been unused since she left, and I swallow, taking it all in and sitting on the couch, now. A careful smile is on my face, and Beth gets up. Moves over to the couch. Throws the covers over us and puts her head on my shoulder, before her breathing slows and she drools on my arm. I lean my head on hers and fall asleep.

The rattle of the door wakes me up. Beth sleeps right through the noise. It must be late afternoon. Maybe four or even five. Sun is high in the sky, and Milly stands just inside with a pan covered with tinfoil. And she doesn’t know what to say about Beth being there. There’s a stunned look on her face. Her eyes and mouth are open and her feet set pretty wide apart, more make up than I have ever seen her wear with big hair and dressed nicely, but she tries to play it off, saying,

“Here’s some dinner. Enchiladas. More than enough for two. I’ve got some coke in the car,” and she sets the pan on the counter. Walks outside and I get up to follow her to the car.

Beth is waking up and looking at me as I walk outside. Milly leans into the car and produces a two-liter bottle of generic lemon-lime soda from the back seat. She hands it to me and says,

“Here,” and shakes her head, avoiding eye contact with me and closing the door.

“Hey, wait a minute.”

“What? I gotta get back to the kids. When you’re feeling better, let me know. You can come get them any time, or they can stay with me. Whatever you need.”

“Milly.” I have to grab her shoulders to look at her.

“What?”

“I’m sorry about this.”

“Sorry about what?”

“I didn’t know.”

“Didn’t know what?” She pulls the last word up with her voice indicating irritation.

“That she was going to come here. You should have called.”

“I wanted to surprise you. Whatever, though, have fun, tonight.”

Milly slams her door. Starts her car and backs out of the driveway as quickly as she can without looking back. It’s hot outside, and Beth is staring out of the window at me.

After we eat, Beth’s stomach gurgles loudly, and she runs to the bathroom. Too much grease and meat and sauce. Her face is emaciated, and it looks like someone blackened her eye or broke her nose at some point a while back and the old green blood drained into her face.

We put on one of the cartoon movies for noise and talk for the first time in a long time. She asks me about Olivia and crumples up into a ball of tears and snot on the couch next to me. And it’s good. We talk about what it would take to fix it all. Our daughter never comes up. I’m waiting for her to mention her, but she doesn’t. We hug a few times. Smoke cigarettes. I pat her knee. She laughs and smiles and cries as the sky turns red and sun sets over the fields behind us, until the earth itself seems to be sinking in a puddle of pink and purple light.

Once it’s completely dark, she goes to the bathroom with her purse and locks the door and turns on the sink. I pace, because I know what it means. Bite my fingernails and move to the couch where I light up a cigarette, and it’s clear to me that I have been waiting for it. Disappoint is what I’ve expected since she showed up, and now it’s here. So, she opens the door slowly. Stands there with a gleam in her eye and moves towards me. The room is strangely silent and electric in the dark, and now she’s standing over me and dancing slowly. Swaying her head from side to side. The lips thin in that chemical crimp and the corners pull back into this impenetrable expression, like the person I was just talking to is completely gone from her body.

“What are you doing?”

“Flying.” She says with a calm, level voice. Her teeth are visible and sharp.

“Flying?”

“I’m an angel, and I have to fly. That’s what angels do.”

It’s a crazy thing to say. Doesn’t make any sense. And now she’s pulling at the elastic in her waistband and descending on me. Heavy in my lap, on my chest. And her nose is wet and cold on my ear, whispering words I don’t understand like some kind of Elysian language spoken by fallen beings in ancient meadows of dew or in mythical fairy worlds where everything is made out of gum drops and cinnamon candy.

And I could tell you all about it, but I won’t. Other than it is awkward and ugly and over as quickly as it begins. And now, she is getting up and wiping her face and picks her bag up off of the floor and walks to the door like she’s going to leave or something. She stops by the kitchen. Staggers and clutches the countertop for a second, before she falls to the floor. Now, the pitiful wails of hurt and remorse and loss belt out of the girl on her hands and knees in the dark.

And so, I bring her back to the couch. Clutch her to my collar bone so that the hot tears roll down through my chest hair. She lies on her back like she’s on a psychiatrist’s couch. Rubs her tears with her fingertips and begins her confession. It starts with shame and guilt and,

“…it…,” which is the closest she comes to mentioning our daughter’s birth and person. And Beth moves onto getting smiles and whistles from the dudes passing by when she smoked on the stairs outside, how that turned into bumming cigarettes she didn’t need and walking over there during the nights when I was at work or sleeping inside during the days.

“I smoked meth since I was 13 years old. Wasn’t nothing to me,” she says, “But cocaine? Never tried it, had the taste, the smell. They were giving it to me for free at first. And then one of the girls came around. She shot me up on the bed, one night,” she says and pauses like she’s come to some great monument in her mind and is silently beholding it’s beauty for a moment, before she continues, “Heroin. I never knew. I never knew I could feel like that, could feel like this.”

She rambles. Rubs her chest with her open palms and widespread fingers. And I stare at the ceiling, dealing with the disappointment, and soon she falls asleep. I cover her up and finally, I fall asleep, too, on the floor. And when I wake up, it’s turning light outside. A garbage truck rattles and hits the brakes over. It is beeping.

Psychedelics have changed my life for both the best and worse, but awkwardly they have also given me the most insightful revelations i could have ever asked for.

People can tell you what to expect on a substance, but its the weird experiences i have had.. Things that only happen to you... that are really weird. 

Like One time i took a 3 week tolerance break from all substances and decided to take a bong hit of cannnabis.. Everything was fine for like 1 and a half minutes.  Then things started to get tracers.. I started to see everything slow down and i was full blown hallucinating clocks and mountians all over my vision..

My problem is that my face is gettin red so often without reason and thats giving me a huge insecurity.
Well, for example : when im talking in front of many people i will go red instantly, i will go red even when someone says or do somethin stupid (instead of him) and many many other things .. and i get flushed too when im exposed to a cold or warm temperatures, when im exercising .. simple bend over to tie shoes will make mine face red for about 30secs .. so basically it looks like that every mental and physical activity will make my face dilatate blood vessles or something and going red as result ..

I heard knocking at the door around 3:00am and instantly thought ""don't fucking answer it as nothing good happens at this time"". So I sat down shaking trying to replay my movie. About 5 minutes later I hear someone picking at the window and trying to break it. I instantly think ""fuck it, they are not breaking my window"". I open the door (I'm an idiot) and some dude in his late 20s/early 30s says he's meeting his friend inside (I lived alone at the time and knew the previous owner of 30+ years prior so it's bullshit) and as I close the door he grabs my arm and pushes me slightly trying to push his way inside my home. Man oh man, the adrenaline going through my veins, I instantly start yelling at the top of my lungs and push him out of my house. He acts all confused as if he's actually waiting for someone but I noticed then and there he seemed, well, high. But not casual stoner high, more so strung out for days on amphetamines. I became even more nervous and told him to get out of here. After this I locked my door and tried to calm my anxiety down watching my movie.

Fast forward another 10 minutes or so and I curiously go and see if he's actually gone. At the corner of my eye all I see is puffs of smoking coming across the edge of my garage. The dude is chain smoking cigarettes at the edge of my garage... the nerve. I began yelling at him again and pretend to call the cops. The guy blurts out random gibberish (could have said something legitimate, I sure as hell didn't hear it properly) and walked away. Ever since then the guy left, security system was installed and I moved for work.

He has basically everything and has tried everything. I ended up having around 80mg of Vancouver molly from the dark web (the cousin has 4 different test kits) and had a 20mg redose an hour later (I weigh 155 on a good day so this was a pretty optimal dose)

It was..... incredible. I know it’s really cliché to be that kid who’s like LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE OMFG but we literally walked around in complete bliss in a peaceful suburban neighborhood for 5 hours, smoking, talking ad nauseam about whateverthefuck. Couldn’t have asked for a better night, or a better drug experience in general, as I’m a little socially anxious and was worried it would be awkward. Won’t go into any more detail because that’s kinda annoying but suffice to say one of the best experiences of my short life.

Here’s the problem. I have a very addictive personality and have struggled with depression and motivation since even before middle school, to the point of being bedridden/suicidal blah blah pity party. But that feeling.... the sheer bliss of that fucking powder.... the feeling that you can fucking take on the world. It’s the optimism that got me the most. But feelings like that dont last in the human brain. It physically cannot be maintained. And that’s what I’m worried about. Will anything in my life ever match that? Is this the start of a horrible path, given the COVID situation allows me infinite free time?

3 months for a T-break just seems like an agonizingly long time to wait for something like that to happen again. I have horrible self control man. This is fucked. And I do NOT mean to discredit the struggle of real addiction, my heart goes out to all of you who struggle, but I am worried that eventually I’ll find a way to convince myself that 3 months is too long and just say fuck it and do it again, and again, and again, and feel worse and worse every day, and my grades keep fucking tanking, just like how I got addicted to video games, adderall, cigarettes and weed. I even tried fucking Spice and did it like 3 more times because I liked escaping to another world. I don’t want to become another gifted kid fuckup story. Then again, maybe I’m just anxious and overthinking everything. 

Do any of you guys have similar experiences with drugs of this caliber? How did you manage to fight the almost constant urge to do it? Any long-term mottos or silly little expressions? (My brain likes that kind of thing)

I was introduced to benzos in September of 2017 by a doctor, who decided to give me a perscription for zolpidem and flurazepam because I suffered from chronic insomnia in the form of DSPD.

Basically what that means is that even in pure darkness, after being active for 15 (sometimes more) hours a day, I couldn't fall asleep until about 4 AM, which sucks when you have to get up at 7 AM.

Before I started taking sleeping aid, I tried to roll with the punches and power through the day, which consisted of 10 hours of class/lab work, 3 hours of homework, and 2 hours of commuting in traffic. Four times a week. 

*I didn't consider smoking weed an option, because I was a pothead and know that weed is STUNNINGLY expensive, and supresses REM sleep (learned this after losing three years of college and a huge sum of money).*

To my surprise, even the combination of two perscribed benzos didn't work, and after doing some research, I decided to order 150 pressed Xanax bars (looking back, they were probably some RC benzo but whatever).

They worked like a charm. I'd take a bar at 10 PM and would be out cold in 15 minutes. 

To my surprise, even after 4 months of use, my tolerance didn't skyrocket.

It was all fine until classes were out and I decided to stop.

Luckily for me, eventually I found out that there are couple of pharmacies in my town that sell benzos OTC, so I got myself a couple of 30x0.5mg and 30x0.25mg boxes of Xanax to taper.

_The reason I didn't use diazepam to taper is because I lack an enzyme that metabolises it, so it has no effect on me whatsoever._

In July of 2018, I did an agressive taper and withdrawals set in.

Up until this point, even with all the research, I didn't really think the withdrawals would be this bad.

Two weeks of rebound insomnia, rebound anxiety, muscle twitches, restless leg syndrome, horrifying panic attacks and IMHO the worst of them all; **sudden episodes of heavy confusion, accompanied by auditory hallucinations and visual distortions**.

*Imagine getting literally lost in your own home town, forgetting your own name, not recognizing the street you passed thousands of times, all while experiencing deliriant level of distortions and your heart pounding like you're about to die. All of that, 5-15 times a day, episodes lasting for up to 20 minutes.*

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention;

**all of this would have been significantly worse, were I not consuming heroin and later on alcohol, to dampen the pure hell I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.**

That gram of dope and later on few glasses of whiskey were the reason I hadn't hung myself during those two weeks. Even doped out I would get maybe 2 hours of NREM sleep a night on average.

After the worst part was over, I slowly started getting back together.

I swore I would never do that to myself ever again.

But then came the mandatory morning classes, lab works and eventually work, and I sold my soul again. 

It's been more than three years, and I went through lighter version of the experience above half a dozen times.

I'm currently finishing my taper from alprazolam, and I haven't had a healthy good night sleep in weeks.

The saddest part is, I've never even seen recreational use of Xanax as an option. In fact, I never took it and stayed awake.

All this hell because I couldn't fucking fall asleep on time to get enough sleep to be up when society required me to.

I blamed myself for the longest time, even though I tried all the healthy options before succumbing to sleep aid.

Even when I stop for good, it's gonna be years before I'm myself again.

So to summarize:

I just came up with this sentence as I was thinking about many of the drug addicts that I met and hang out with during my active addiction in the past years and compared them to where they are now in the present, that made me realize the meaning behind those words.

Someone like me who have went experienced with heroin, meth, or drugs alike, does likely already knows this: drugs do affect people's future and depending upon which one does one abuse, their future can be severely affected by it, and never be the same. 

By saying that my very good friend from high school who introduced me to weed as my first recreational drug a few years ago, is in good hands now and it's building up a bright future for him as an artist; he even made it to a famous TV show for singers to participate on a 2 month competition where the best one to achieve it is rewarded with a hundred thousand dollars, but even though he didn't win, he still managed to get some clout on social media and used that to push his career to a new level. He never do harder drugs nor did look for others than just weed

All of my friends who stick with weed are either doing good or are not as fucked as the next ones I'm about to talk of. 

In the other hand, the friend who later on introduced me to heroin is disappeard. I can tell much about him as I don't know where he's now, but his family haven't heard from him since Octuber 17, 2018. He basically introduced me to the streets and taught me why I should never trust no one. His name was Ramiro.

The second heroin addict I began to hang with was because of him so when he wasn't available to give him money to find me a dealer to get dope, I had this other dude to reach out. His steetname is ""Chino"", and he's currently serving time in prision for assaulting a pharmacy. 

One of the most honest and coolest persons that I have met in my life was also a girl who was addicted to heroin. His boyfriend made her to get into this evil drug, and once she became addicted, the whole a life ahead of her disappeared in a single shot that contained too much. She just had gotten out from rehab, so I texted her to know if she was okay and wanted to ask her to see us soon, but as soon as I woke up next day a post from Facebook on her profile appears on my news feed with a photo of her on heaven that says ""RIP"". Her name was Karla.

And the list goes on. I only said a few cases but I know about a hundred more, and for some reason a very similar destiny have applied to many of them. Only one person I know who kicked the habit for good and is doing well now, most others now are either in prision, dead, in the streets or other dissapear, the rest kept living in poverty.

By this I don't mean that people who only smoke weed will have a wonderful future, neither I mean that heroin/dope addicts are condemned to self destruction, but it gives a little background about the huge difference that one substance can do in someone's life and stick forever.

I know this doesn't apply to everyone neither, but in my experience it strangely has happened this way. I wonder if many others can say the same too, as I don't know.

I don't mean I'd know one's destiny only by knowing their drug habits, but if I had applied this reasoning when I first started, many of them cases I'd have been right, as strangely as it sounds...",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,685216,public,confidence,self,Tell me about your drug habits and I tell you about your destiny.,0,[],0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h0o3j6/tell_me_about_your_drug_habits_and_i_tell_you/,no_ads,0.0,1591863708.0,,,,,,,,,,1591838838.0,,,,,,,,,,,

 I have just been smoking it and I see how that gets compulsive in the moment.

Heroin is just like a brief euphoria followed by hours of narcolepsy... I fell asleep standing up, sitting in a cold shower, wherever... wake up barely knowing where I am for like 5 minutes... totally puts the dope in dope. Then shaking and barfing and feeling cold later that night. My body hurts for a day or two after and I don't feel like I ever felt dramatic pain relief.

It's wonderful as I am not physically addicted to any drug anymore, as I used to be doing heroin for 3 years on and off, but last time I kept using almost every day for the last 7-8 months. It came to a point where I needed to keep on buying half a gram and shoot it up every fucking day, and I wasn't even getting high on it! I was feeling no rush at all, just letting me feel normal and barely able to function as before. I feel so happy for this accomplishment of mine, but still don't congratulate me as I am facing with other issues that I haven't fixed yet. 

Short story: 

Since Mexico has no methadone/suboxone clinics nor any other legal opiate medication to help heroin addicts to make it through wd's, it's hard as fuck to keep the word once the symptoms start to kick in; only Tramadol (OTC in here) is the only option that we are left with, but it's so weak that it doesn't even help with the symptoms on the first days, so I had to buy some meth in order to resist from withdrawals, as it's high provided numbs for great part of the pain and it kept me busy for several days until the physical sickness it's gone. It seemed to work for some reason, but only for me though, I wouldn't recommend it to other people as it may make things just worse and add up another substance on the hooked-up addiction list of one's self. 

So far today, I've made it through the worst part already, the sickness is totally gone, my post use depression and psychological trauma to abuse opiates on a daily have healed faster than I thought, Tramadol works great now as a weak pain reliever whenever I get muscle aches and/or feel anxiety to go back; however, that decision to do meth again to stop me from getting fucked by opiate withdrawal has tricked my brain into now triggering myself to try more of this drug instead of the other! What the fuck!? 

It's time now to move forward and sober, but after quitting heroin and meth a week after, it's been 3 weeks since I should supposedly be fully recovered from drugs yet I have relapsed two times on meth again, one from last week and a second one from today. 

It's weird because previously to heroin, meth seemed like a very addictive to me drug but once gotten that warm feeling rush from a nod on a heroin high after putting down the needle, my everything changed and escalated things to another whole other level, so much that I completely forgot about meth and heroin became the relief I was looking for in drugs and in my life in overall; it should've stayed that way but it changes when I get off of opiates and, my brain knowing heroin is out of discussion, triggers me into use the nearest addictive substance compared to heroin that it knows, which is meth and which also explains a lot of my current issue.

I lived in Spain from September to March of this year and that’s where I discovered drugs (I only did weed, coke and ecstasy). I began really harshly: one night I took way too much ecstasy without drinking any water for several hours which sent me to the hospital. I began to do drugs again every 4 or 5 weeks. I might’ve done coke like 5 or 6 times. I went home in March and ever since I always think of coke. At the beginning I wasn’t « craving » it but it was always a thought at the back of my head like oh yeah that was great, hope I can do it again some time. But since quarantine is over in France I’m partying and drinking every two days, and alcohol really triggers this « craving » for me. Everytime I’m drunk (i have also craved alcohol for a long time, still do) I seek drugs, ask people if they have something etc. The issue is i have a sort of addictive personality, but yet I don’t know if « craving » is the right word. For three weeks I’ve been thinking about coke everyday, I really really want to do it again, my sister smokes weed and I would also really want to smoke if there isn’t anything else, even if I don’t really like weed that much. I really don’t know what’s going on, if I’m craving it or if I just like the idea of it, but I’m this close to ask my friend for his dealer’s number. Can anyone give me some advice?

My main plug had some bud that wasn’t getting me where I’d want to be, so I messaged another plug and got an eighth of some different bud. The new bud would get me absolutely faded after smoking even a quarter gram.

So last night I smoked a lot, I smoked atleast a gram before hopping on Xbox to play some cod. After about an hour of peace and quiet I hear something jumping around on boxes. I look back and see it was a small frog climbing the door to the room. I guess because I was so stoned I got a bit freaked out, I decided to just stay out and let him leave on his own. He did so eventually I’m playing cod thinking “what if this is one of my dead relatives coming to visit me?” Im a very anxious person so a ghost would probably make me faint, so what if they came back as a frog lmao. 


I pay the thought no mind since I was stoned and realized it’s probably just one of the frogs I hear every night in our backyard. The frog had left the room so I get up to walk back to my room. When I open the door to walk in our kitchen I couldn’t see the frog anywhere, it’s about a 15-20 foot walk to my room, around a couple corners and passing 3 other rooms. 

I’m smoking some bud in my room when I hear something jumping around on the floor, the frog managed to walk all the way through my house and come to my room. He jumped near me and being high as hell I said to him “hey buddy can you get out of my room”. When I looked away he hopped back twords my door, jumped into the door and fell down about 20-30 times and eventually left my room. Haven’t seen him today so idk what happened to him.

It's not meant to be exact and of course others may have different opinions on these substances, but I was just having some fun.

LSD: Your father - Clearly loves you, but can have a very firm hand. He's not afraid to discipline you when you need it. Still, as you mature you realize that he has your best interests at heart and that he can be a lot of fun.

Shroom: Your mother - Your relationship with her is a bit more gentle and emotionally driven than the one with your father. You can really feel her love for you on a deep level... and because of this, when she is disappointed in you it can hurt more than with anyone else. Like your father, you can learn a lot from her.

Mescaline: Your sibling - Youthful and energetic, they are easier to hang out with and relate to. There's definitely love between you, but you don't have to worry as much about how  you behave around them. Still the bond is very real, and they can still call you out on your shit when you need it.

DMT: Your teacher (or your shaman) - They can be a loving, and even a very fun person. But at the end of the day, your relationship with them is about learning. They are here to guide you, and show you things... things you want to know about and some things you don't. They clearly care about you, but they are here to teach and you should be mindful of their lessons.

Other analogues (2Cx, DOx, ect.): The people you work with or meet in the world - All of them have their own personality and their own story to tell. You could learn from most of them if you really got to know them. Some of them are friendly and easy to get along with, some of them less so.

There is nothing heroic about the following:
Blacking out
Injuring yourself or others
Going to jail
Going to the hospital
Wrecking your car
Scaring your family and friends
Risking psychological repercussions
Losing your job
Getting kicked out
Shitting yourself
Waking up in vomit
Psychosis

I am 100% sure this has been said before but I think from time to time it needs repeating, for the new person.
It does a tremendous disservice to the responsible psychedelic community. I'm not saying never have fun or take a large dose. I've done it myself so I'm not trying to come at people from a perspective of I never made a mistake. So if you think these substances have a place in society then treat them as such. If you choose to take a massive dose of a psychedelic do not do it alone, have someone responsible to watch you. I myself love psychedelic substances, I would like to see them be accepted into society and this is how we start.

but basically the point of this post, theres this girl ive known for years who constantly lies about doing drugs (and having sex but thats a different story) and its just so fucking cringey, and i get a bit offended that she thinks id believe such idiocy. she told me last night she did an entire 8ball of coke at once, despite not ever having a job and having no money to her name. i was just fucking with her too like “wow i didnt hear about this promotion that would allow for you to afford such a habit” and she couldnt really explain herself

now shes saying shes gonna eat like 1000mg in edibles, despite only having smoked at maximum 2 times

like i get this behavior is inoffensive and just kind of annoying, but i wanted to know if anyone has similar experiences, and how to catch someone in a lie without blatantly telling them “stop taking me for a fool, i know youre full of shit”

I have a question and I am not finding much info elsewhere. 
I have a TMJ disorder, which if you don't know, it affects the joints and muscles in your jaw. Basically in my day to day life I have jaw pain (ranging from minimal discomfort to so much pain that I can only eat soft foods that day) clicking, and a few times my jaw has actually popped out of place and gotten stuck there for a few moments. This all developed about 2 years ago. 
I have taken molly many times so I have a lot of experience with it, but have not taken any since probably 5 years ago before my TMJ issues arose. 
I plan to roll this weekend but am feeling very anxious about potential affects on my jaw! I am horrible about grinding and clenching while rolling and am terrified I will wake up the next day in severe pain, or even pop my jaw out of place while rolling. I'm nervous to the point that I'm wondering if I should even take it??

Just wondering if anyone else has experience with this, or any suggestions for limiting the tension on my jaw during my high.

I have a feeling people will blindly dismiss this suggestion and say that my trip will be killed - without having tried themselves. My first thought is that this would happen but after thinking more about it, maybe it could work well

From my understanding opioids bind to opioid receptors which are endogenously activates by endorphins, which creates the pain relief aspect and can also lead to euphoria.

I’ve heard in recovery classes in what not that opiates release dopamine which has me wondering how does that happen if they only bind to the opioid receptors? Is it the act of taking the drug and the stimulation of those receptors that causes dopamine to be released? Or do opioids bind to dopamine receptors also?

In it it says that my mother was taking Prozac, Valium and Darvocet for the whole first trimester of the pregnancy.

All my life I've had horrible anxiety, mood swings and depression. Up until a year ago I had been very wary of SSRIs because of all the side-effects and the horrible withdrawals I'd read about, but I finally took the plunge. I started out on an SSRI/partial agonist called Viibryd.

It helped *a lot* compared to some other meds I've taken but it had some weird side-effects and I noticed I was still having a fair bit of anxiety and mood issues 

Well cut to two or three weeks ago. Viibryd is name-brand only and I could no longer afford to pay 300$ a month after my doctor ran out of free samples a few months back. Terrified of the withdrawals I've experienced from missing doses on occasion, I asked my doctor for Prozac just to have a cheaper SSRI in my system until they got more samples in.

Well...damn. I was expecting a rocky road of mild withdrawals but the Prozac has been. A. May. Zing. I have never felt this calm and anxiety-free in my life. Like as much as Viibryd was better than other classes of anti-depressants and mood stabilizers I've tried, Prozac was still leaps and bounds better.

So now I'm a little depressed because I'm wondering if I've just spent my whole life miserable from some kind of fucked up Prozac withdrawals from my mother's use. 

Questions:

Does exposing a fetus to a drug cause permanent stunting  of the corresponding receptor systems it affects? Is this a known cause of serious anxiety disorders?

Are SSRIs known to be particularly harmful in pregnancy?

Which trimester of pregnancy are drugs the most damaging? Is anything in the fetal brain even developed enough for drugs to affect in the first trimester?


Idk guys this whole epiphany really threw me for a loop and I'm kind of upset over the whole thing. Please add in any other thoughts or comments you feel might be useful or relevant.

Life was really good down there, or maybe it was the age.. I grew up in a small town, everyone knows everyone typa shit, not much to do and no exposure to drugs at an early age, unlike Australia.. I have a couple of mates that I still miss to this day and talk online once a week or so.  


Started school in the last term of year 10, I was a shy kid at first, language barrier for those who can relate, started talking more and more and became more open about stuff, girls, ""mates"", oppurtunities came around... I'm pretty good at soccer so that's what I've been doing ever since I came here, apart from studying high school and now attempting to get into university.  


I have lovely parents, they care about me very much, my father is something of a philosopher in my eyes, he knows right from wrong and has had a solution for almost every problem I have faced ever since being here. He grew up split from his dad, my grandfather, he lived in Serbia, while my dad had to grow with a single mother. Lowkey same goes for my mother, her dad passed away at the age of 49 due to a heart attack... she was growing with a single mother from the age of 15, hard to cope knowing my mother and how she reacts to stuff... maybe it was the death of my grandfather from mums side that got her like this... shes always stressed and always thinking about me.. they want me to study and finish university and stay away from bad shit.  


However I got introduced to weed at the age of 17 or 18.. not too sure to be honest(thats the weed taking its toll on my brain) anyways, I found a job at a liquor store and that went on for about a year before I quit because I was given shit by my boss for not cleaning the smallest shit stain in the restroom at work, im positive it was his shit stain but anyways, fuck it... so I figured I'll make some extra cash and sold a bit of weed on the side... if you know Balkan parents, you'd know that for them, weed is like heroin lol...  


Fast forward to 2019/20, a lot of unfortunate events have been taking place at my household, such as my mother catching me with two ounces of weed... she had a nervous breakdown by the looks of it and is hard for her to stay calm... shes a cleaner at a hospital and I know she can do much better, however, as I said, language barrier is in the way and its very hard for her to eliminate this barrier so she cleans... her blood pressure always goes up because of my actions... as im writing this she is probably losing sleep just because I got caught with 20 xanax bars that were meant to go in the next week.. for once, my dad does not have a solution and im having a real hard time earning their trust back... how can she trust me when all I do is get involved in bullshit like this.  


enough of my rant.. my point is.. just be careful and always have your paranoia in the back of your head, it will save you(my dads words)  


Thanks to whoever read this, if you have been in a similar situation yourself, feel free to flick me a message or just drop a comment on how you dealt with it.

I'm a 21 FTM transgender guy living in the UK. After several years of waiting, I finally had my first appointment yesterday with a clinic who are able to help me transition, which I'm over the moon about! I will be having some appointments to freeze and store my eggs soon, so I have the option of having biological children at some point. The doctor I spoke to has advised me to stop smoking cigarettes and joints, due to tobacco affecting fertility. However, she also said that tobacco thickens the blood, which is something that testosterone also does, so mixing the two can be lethal.

However, I was so caught up in the moment (I've been waiting four years for that appointment, and I thought that egg freezing was something I wasn't able to do, when it's actually free where I live), that I forgot to mention that I do have experience using drugs harder than weed, and asking her how well they would mix with testosterone.

I have experience using MDMA, ketamine, cocaine, LSD and mushrooms, amongst other things that I'm open to. I don't know if I'm using the right search terms, but I'm unable to find anything about mixing testosterone and recreational drugs (other than mixing drugs with steroids, which I'm not sure is the same thing). If I need to, then I'll stop using drugs so I'm able to use hormones safety, but my friends and I enjoy using these drugs and I would like to continue using them if the risk of me using them doesn't have much affect whether I'm on hormone therapy or not. (I am aware of the normal risks of drugs and do my best to keep myself and others safe, such as testing our drugs, keeping hydrated etc.)

I was wondering if anyone was able to post any helpful resources, advice or experiences about this? If need be, I'm happy to phone my doctor or the clinic for information as my GP is aware that I have experience with drugs.

I decided that it will be a good time to try mushrooms. I did acid a couple times and also did 2cb once, so I felt somewhat prepared to take 3g of shrooms. I always dreamed about the one enlightning expirience that will just feel like a dream and I knew that a big dose will get me there. So my friends poped the acid (110ug each), and I took my shrooms about an hour after them. 

After 30 minutes I was already laying down on a blanket, having trouble controling what was going on around me and with my body. When the peak kicked in the reality just shattered and I was convinced that this is what my life is now. Every sound and feeling was amplified like 3 times, Somehow I forgot how did I get to that state and that was getting really confusing to me. I asked my friend who was on acid ""What's the point of that?"" And she just replied ""There's no sense, you have to find your own path"" so I started making this concept in my head that this is going to last for ever and I somehow broke the reality and now I'm in this blessful state, where I can just do whatever I want becouse there is no end of this. Additionally no one really bothered me becouse they thought that it will be best if they let me enjoy myself, but when I told the reality to play a specific song, it just started playing, so I thought that I am in control of this world. (Of course that were my friends playing it to satisfy my request). 

Some time later two other girls came on the beach (one which I had a crush on once). In my stupidity I though to myself to just go for the most pleasureble thing, if this is now going to go on forever (I totally lost any care for my frinds as I was convinced that this is just a game where I can do whatever I want). Anyway I started touching her in private areas and she of course tried to stop me but she knew that I was going through harsh trip so she just tried to help me and stay with me, while I violated her body. When the trip was wearing of I slowly started realizing what I did. I just sat alone with my head down and I was wathing the visuals as I felt more and more like a piece of shit.

The lesson here is to always have someone who can told you that its just a substance and it will wear off while you trip, you can be convinced that this is the reality now and start doing some fucked up things, especially if you take a high dose of the psychodelic. The trip was defenetly the best experience of my live, I had out of body expierinces, I felt like my and my frinds were a geometrical 3D object, and other types of weird things, but the feeling of violating someone while I was tripping just diminish any magic related to that trip. Now I feel like shit. Thanks if you read this all and I wish you happy tripping.

 Ive alawys wanted to write a trip report about this but i was too lazy, this is a comment i replied to that asked how the trip was so it might not be written in post form, hope you guys enjoy though:) safe rolls&lt;3

Honestly kinda scary, when it kicked in it was intense as fuck, i made the mistake of smoking a couple bowls at my peak and the MDA just skyrocketed through the roof, a lot of deliriant like hallucinations, pbjects in my house/room were morphing, idk how but somehow someone from my snap story told a friend to come over, im living in a new town so i wasnt really close with her(the friend), she really made the trip worse by not calming me down but asking me these weird questions, and every time i zoned out and saw something cool shed ruin it by saying

\-(my name)! Are you here? Hellooo?-

and i was really uncomfortable with her doing that and she kept taking videos of me and my shoes or something like that but at the time i looked at social media like it was lucifer, i just didnt want anything to do with it and even after i asked her to stop she didnt and it made me really frustrated,

anyhow we decided to go to a club nearby, when i walked out i was seeing flying pigs, i know its crazy but i mean mda is a deliriant at high doses so anything can happen, i saw dogs with their owners, a lot of them on this field i was walking through, but when i went to stroke them they disappeared, i saw huge, i mean fucking huge like 10 meter, 20 meter people walking around in the distance and a spider like ant with a human head climbing sround a museum, when one of these giants was a bit closer i shouted for it to come here and it just looked me dead in the eyes with these devil eyes, i scared myself to fucking death it was so scary, we then walked further and we went past this little kiosk thats a little museum of a world war 2 kiosk and theres was a mannequin inside and its face kept melting away and it was scary, also a huge tree popped out of the ground and a bird fell on my friend, convincing me shed be in pain but nothing happened,

we then proceeded to go to the club and we went inside and it was some shitty night since the club had some shitty ass music, so we decided to visit her friends nearby who make music in this little like room and we smoked some weed there and it kicked off again, i really wanted to go home but my friend said she wanted to stay there,

so i set off on my journey home (alone) i kept seeing random animals flying through the sky and people that looked exactly like me but were in all black and had a black nike bag, and whenever i called out to them they also gave me this evil red eye look, anyway when i was coming out the gates of this club idk if this was real or not but a group of russian guys were standing there and talking and laughing about me, when i was a bit down the road i could hear them talking theyll kill me and rob me and stuff like that, terrifying shit man, i was scared, anyway the kiosk thing was near and i could see a fire and a party going on there so i walked towards it since my apartament was that way anyway, i kept seeing all these animals and people in black etc. after smoking the weed the trip took a really dark turn, when i got to the fire place there wasnt any fire so i decided to keep going, i heard footsteps behind me so i turned around and saw these silhouettes, invisible people but i could see the outline of them, i still shit my pants thinking about them but one was hiding behing a pine tree with a invisible pistol aiming at me and one was on a invisible scooter and had a rifle aiming at me, i thought this was real so i shit my pants but i took control of the situation and just turned around and continued walking, i was on the field now, i kept walking a bit and i heard something behind me again so i turned around and there was this orange parking cone and this silhouette was inside the cone, whenever i looked at it, it stopped,whenever i wasnt looking it moved, i was fucking shitting my pants at 3 am on a field thinking some silhouette is about to kill me, scary shit since i didnt know if this silhouette was human or not, anyway i try to ignore it and keep moving, all is well until im nearly at the end of the field and i turn around and theyre both there again, i fucking told them to fuck off and that ill kill them, they said nothing, expressed nothing, these mfs didnt have eyes, ears or nothing, it was like they were wearing full body suits that made them invisible yet somehow i still saw them, anyhow i stay there in place shouting at them and they get closer and closer, one of them starts running at me, i start fucking running faster than i ever have in my life, holy shit, i could feel him breathing into my ear and his hands touching my back, when i got off the field and back to my blocks i screamed for help and i ran to my block door to get in, i got into to the apartment and prayed that all will be well, i then got out of the elevator in my block and walked to my door, there was a kind man in glasses who only had hair on the sides of his head and a black little girl in a skirt, i completely forgot about the terrifying shit that just happened and greeted them, the man handed me my keys which were actually in my pocket, i went inside and the black little girl followed, my phone was at 1 percent and my charger was in another room, first i wanted to get into my room though, i then saw the black little girl morph into a silhouette, I immediately closed my door, and went to the corner of my room, i hid there and i wanted to go get my charger to call someone for help but every time i got close to the door, the handle started shaking all over the place and i felt this like terrifying bass, so a friend could come over lver or something but ny phone ran out of battery and i couldnt do anything, i eventually passed out from exhaustion, i woke up the next day and still hid in that corner until i just could not sit there and not have a drink, so i quickly ran to my kitchen to get milk and grabbed my charger whilst i was at it, charged my phone and called my buddys from my old town to tell them, i was still scared to get close to the door since i was still debating wether it was real or not. Worst trip of my life tbh.

I'm sorry this is long, I really need emotional support

So I went to this private christian boarding school for four years, my highschool. My legal guardians (parents passed away) couldn't handle my undiagnosed mental illnesses and basically send me away. The 4 years there was like a cult, it's a very small school. Oh and it also happens to be simaltaneuously a ranch. 

I could go on all day about my high school, but today I'm gonna share my experience with recently being rejected because of diagnoses and medication:

My legal guardians kicked me out of the house at 18, right before college. I have no contact with them and they won't let me see my brother. I have done nothing wrong to warrant this. Well, this summer my old high school (the ranch) offered me a ten day paid internship. I said ""Sure, I need the money"". Well, as soon as I missed my layover flight things got bad, 

Because I missed my layover I didn't have my bag, which had my medications in it. I'm taking low dose Vrylar, Lamictal, and clonozepam. I told the head of the school and ranch (who I am or was very close to) that I might get sick since I couldn't take them. Immediately she's like ""What meds and why?? When you were with us you were perfect!"". No I wasn't ""good"". I'm type 2 and I have depressive swings that put me through hell at a Christian high school. I was disciplined for feeling sad. 

So when I arrive I immediately feel a change within this person that I was so close too. She's very antimed and since I arrived, been complaining about how my meds have made me a different person. She said I never had social anxiety, NOT TRUE. She said it's all the doctors pushing meds, NOT TRUE. I seeked a Dr. out because I wanted help- and I feel SOOO much better today. 

I had to milk the cow as part of my internship duties, and the cow had just calved so it's a lot of milk. Oh, and it's hand milking. I hand milked 5 gallons of milk! But now i had to carry it 1/4 mile to the kitchen. I hadn't been working on a ranch in forever so I asked for help carrying it. She claimed that it was because of my ""meds"" that I couldn't do it!!!! I still ended up carrying four gallons and somebody else got the last. 

I feel depressed and feel thrown out simply because I told her what I was all along. Not to mention she thinks I'm ""not me"" because of my meds. I've known her for 6 years, and was a major person in my life when my parents died. Now I'm rejected. I feel terrible. 

As I type this, I am on the way to the airport because she felt like I couldn't do the job and that she didn't want to ruin our ""relationship"". All of this is such BS and she only wants me gone now because I started taking meds to treat what I've always struggled with. I'm flying back home to my loving and understanding boyfriend 3 days into the 10 days internship.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,685085,public,confidence,self,"Rejected By Everyone who I thought Cared about me, because of PRESCRIBED meds",0,[],0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h0888e/rejected_by_everyone_who_i_thought_cared_about_me/,no_ads,0.0,1591813918.0,Custom,14240396-9da9-11e5-9ca6-0e5d32eec499,Drug Stigma/Need Love,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And I’m fuckin heartbroken that I lost one of my day one homies to drug addiction. As a child that grew up with no siblings, he acted as a brother to me, as well as to many of our friends in my group. He was the one that loved getting people to smile &amp; had a damn contagious laugh if I’ve ever heard one. I’m gonna miss you man, we were supposed to be homies for life... but now, all that’s left are the memories we shared.

Throughout high school we dabbled in various drugs. We didn’t think of consequences, we were only focused on how many different things can we affect our body with. Because it was fun &amp; life is pretty fuckin painful. At some point we became addicted to just being intoxicated off anything. From weed, ecstacy, lsd, xans, shrooms, coke, etc., you name it. But it started to become obvious that it really was a problem that would continue after graduating. 

In a quick 2-3 years, my friend moved to the habit of smoking *blues*. Otherwise known as oxycontin. I never approved of it but I always trusted that he was doing alright. Because that was my homie and we’ve always been coo, no matter what the substance was. Any problem he had, he always found a way to make things alright. I’m guilty to admit that his reassurance of him handling it was okay to me. But the deeper he succumbed to it, the harsher his world had become. 

Backs were turned on him due to the things he had to resort to in order to feed his habit. I truly felt bad because I knew it was such a harsh thing to have to deal with. And many outsiders didn’t know otherwise, only that drugs played a role into his downfall. It’s not surprising because it’s a very uncomfortable topic to talk about within the people we knew. It hurts that I wasn’t able to do more and instead had to watch him fall into despair. When we first started to do drugs, he sounded so certain that the only thing he’d touch is weed. He denied doing coke for a while &amp; never even let him until he was sure about it.

Over time, he managed to try &amp; pick himself back up by getting back on his shit. It happened before with xans, so I trusted that he’d be okay. Matter of fact, the day before his life was taken, I had just spoken to him on how happy I was that he was out of rehab. Never would have thought it would come to losing a friend. Life is too fragile and I’m torn on how this all turned out. He ended up trying it once more &amp; it turned out to be his last. The pill was cut with bunk shit &amp; it ended up being too strong for him to handle. It’s sickening to hear.

This was a friend that I used to skip school with, just to smoke weed with. The friend that would be down to drink just because. A friend that would smoke me out because he cared. He gave me a place to sleep, a place to roll in safety. A place to just hang out during rainy days. We finally started gaming together again but he was still struggling with his addiction. His company was always welcomed to have around. The first time some of our homies smoked was at his house. I was looking forward to the promising future we had &amp; growing old with the boys. I wanted to smoke a legal blunt with you on the day you &amp; me turned 21. Heartbroken to know it won’t be possible. 

Please guys, don’t be afraid to reaching out &amp; being a friend to someone you love. I understand a person can only change if they want to themselves, but it still would mean a lot. No person should ever go through the tragedy of losing a loved one, especially to something as dangerous as drugs. My homie never will get the chance to really experience life as a grown man. It especially hurts knowing &amp; seeing the faces of his family. No parent should ever bury their child. His siblings are way too young to be put through this shit. 

Rest easy J, I’ll be smoking up another blunt for you. I’m already fuckin missing you bro, may you rest in paradise young king.

Edit: Woke up to a bunch of comments after venting all of this late last night &amp; tbh, my story barely even scratches the surface of what this guy meant to me. I went through all your comments and just had to break down &amp; cry because this shit is reality. And the reality is, I’ll have one less homie to reflect back on all the good times with. I was hoping I’d only wake up from a bad dream. But I really do appreciate all of your kind words. It’s gonna be hard to move on but I’d be doing him a disservice if I didn’t continue to keep shit moving. All of this just gives me much more of a reason to live my life out, as I’m sure he wanted the best for all of us. I’ve experienced death with relatives, but losing someone you grew up with is like losing a part of you... I never thought me &amp; my homies would have to go through this shit this young.

My question to americans is why this downer is so famous in america?

- is it because those rappers talking about xanax?

- consumption of benzos was famous before or after these rappers talking about benzos?

- Is it famous because people think blacking out and doing stupid shit is fun?

I did a little bit of h tonight with my buddy and had the most fucked up dream of my life. 

So it started like this. I was hanging out with my friend who I did h with, we'll call him Jeff. I'm gonna sum up the dream but just know it was the most realistic set of dreams I ever had. Any ways me and Jeff are chilling and I give him a cactus. I take it back though just to repot it. I bring it back to my house where I go to pour some potting soil in a bigger pot . it spills eveywhere and I pick the cactus out of the pot and go to put it in the bigger pot. Theres this weird goo growing out of the pot. Its growing up the cactus and onto my hands too. I look around this goo is growing everywhere. I run to my dads room and start knocking on the door screaming for help. My dad and my step mom run out and start fighting off the goo with me. The been telling me this been going on for the past few days now. I'm helping them fight off the goo but when I try to go back into my room my door turns into a mirror. The goo os also cloning up my body and into my eyes nose and mouth. 

Then i wake up and hear jeff laughing. I start to tell him about my dream but he keeps interrupting me to tell me about his. Im like ""Yo Jeff!!! Listen to this shit man it was scary"". He hops on the bed and is like ""my bad yo tell me about your dream"". So I'm telling him when one of my other good buddies walk in, we'll call him Robbie. I'm like ""oh shit whats up Robbie"" and hes all smiling and says  ""good to see you man"". Then i look ove and i see two Robbie. I'm like ""yo Robbie theirs two of you"". Robbie says ""nah bitch theirs 3 of me im lit"" im staring at the three Robbies and I look over at Jeff and start laughing he's laughing too. I say ""oh shit guess im still asleep huh?"" He looks at me and gives me a big freaky smile and says ""SLEEP?!?!"" ""Nah man your dead"" then he starts laughing even harder Robbies doing his thing theirs still 3 of him he's like dancing with himself or something. I can now feel myself barley breathing. I look at Jeff and said ""I dont wanna be dead""  he says ""playing overdose is a fucked up game huh?"" And starts laughing even more. I say ""I gotta go"" but he grabs my and and my body locks up and begins to slowly fall into the bed. ""Where do you have to go to buddy, your dead ma, I think you should stay."" I hit the bed and begin sinking into it. I feel dead at this point can't move any part of my body. I get the feeling if I get too low into this bed I'm dead for real. Keep in mind that I still don't know that I'm dreaming at this point. With all my strength I grab my buddies arm znd say ""NO!!! not today sorry buddy"" I pull myself outta bed and stumble to my friends room. I start shaking him ""yo Jeff I took too much"".  He looks at me and nods in agreement. He pulls out a needle and shoots it into my veins. ""Narcan"" he says. Then I woke up in my actual bed.

This whole dream happened in an hour btw.

Edit: I wrote this I was still high and fighting my nod I forgot to mention when i woke up I was barley breathing. Thats how i knew i had to wake up.

Pros 

- taste good ,drinkable like juice or could be drank with food 

- Easy to be a functional alcoholic 

- the drunk feels better 

- Rarely get hungover due to all the liquid your consuming 

- rarely wake up wondering wtf u did last night 

Cons 

- having to pee every 5 seconds 

- possible weight gain 


Of course if you drink like 10 beers the whole pros list is out the window , but I’ve come to realize being  fucked up drunk is not even fun anyways , getting to the point of relaxation , warmth  and being a little  free of anxiety but still having your motor skills and reasonable thought in tact is the best level of drunk

Everything is funny, and I have a hard time with basic motor skills like walking in a really straight line, holding a pen, etc. and it is hard to think clearly. It's like being underwater, and everything is in slow motion, including my thoughts. Also I get very sleepy. My inhibitions are not lowered. I don't get munchies. 

I feel like I experience some parts of what I'm told being drunk is like, and some parts high. Can anyone here clarify this for me? Thanks so much!

Just an all round solid and a good middle ground nothing like beers with the boys a very pleasant and enjoyable one

Weed - 5/10
Honestly not too fussed about weed I go through phases where I really like it and other times I really don’t enjoy it (which I put down to getting weed that’s too strong for how infrequently i smoke) it’s nice and chill and is a good pair with other drugs but it’s never the main event for a night

Shrooms 10/10
Just a truely amazing experience, absolute bliss and joy I’ve been lucky enough to have never had a bad trip and all my experiences had me thinking it would be impossible to have a bad trip and had me constantly telling my friends this is the most significant and spiritual moment of my life

Mdma 7/10
Still new is to this, low doses are great for a little mood boost, but bigger doses had me feeling super euphoric but didn’t have a very clear headspace and it made me feel “simple”

Ritalin - 4/10
Suits almost any occasion and is great paired with alcohol but the come down and day after are shit, worse than mdma in my experience

Oxycodone - 8/10
Euphoria was insane at first and it’s one of my all time favorites but recently did it again after a 1-2year break and was honestly disappointed by the euphoria, still good but not as insane as I remembered

Codeine - 8/10
This is one of my favorites, I almost always have it in liquid form (usually because I have to do a cwe) but I find that makes if feel very smooth and pleasant and am usually able to reach a similar level as the oxys 

Tapentadol - 6.5/10
Less euphoric than oxys or codeine but had me nodding much harder witch was good fun

Gabapentin 9/10
This drug is amazing, it’s so helpful for hangovers and comedowns, helps with sleep, gives a good mood boost and is great for unwinding after a stressful day, this is the only drug I’ve felt useful for anxiety and depression

Tamazapam 4/10
Pretty much no recreational value to me, but great at kicking insomnia shit just knocks you out

Ketamine 4/10
Very new to this (I feel this rating will go up once I have more experience), only done once recently and it just made me feel real weird, I think it might get better with higher doses, I’ve just been cautious not to k hole and most experiences felt lack luster and just had me at a point where thinking wasn’t really possible and made my head feel hollow

Nitrous/Nangs 6/10
Pretty mediocre on their own but when you use them with mdma it is insane, but I’ve had it in a medical setting and really found I didn’t like it as pain relief

Green whistle 7/10
No clue what it is in terms of actual name, but it’s a pain killer they use in Australia instead of laughing gas, and it’s so much better, is like nitrous and oxycodone in one",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,685025,public,confidence,self,Another drug review,0,[],0.63,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h022zn/another_drug_review/,no_ads,0.0,1591785320.0,,e3e60fc2-9638-11e8-b910-0e8093d70bd0,I :love: Drugs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the middle of the party i pop half a XTC  after 40 minutes im starting to feel it and i pop the other half,1 hour later the party is over and we are heading to my friends apartment to continue hanging out, we do couple of lines the XTC starts hitting me even harder my words are getting slured and i cant even say a normal sentence, we start smoking the rest of the weed (idk around 15gs) drink some more etc.
When everyone left and we were like 3 ppl left in the apartment i started getting really tired like my image was shifting on the side and eventually I passed out, i don't remember how long i was passed out but they told me around 4-5 hours, while sleeping the only thing I remember is that i was playing a game( the 2D old school pac man type) and was really struggling to win, after some time i won ( dont know how i dont really remember the dream) and wake up immediately feeling like I literally got reborned.
So my question is after smoking at least 20 j's, doing 10 normal lines of speed, drinking a fuckton of alkohol and popping a pill
Could've I overdosed on all of that? And does someone else ever  played a game in their dreams and woke up as soon as they won?

I've done to much speed since april, couple days a week and high doses, around 200-400 mg snorted per day at the worst. I'm gonna take a break now i hope, but its hard to stay away, any tips? When i've been off for some days i get tiered and bored, and when i fuck up and snort again there is no big kick, i just get awake for hours, wich results in no sleep just laying there trying... 

 The last time i did cocaine (1 week ago) it also had little effect, and felt like waste...  

I also snortet oxy last week, it was my second time. I did a total of 40mg, got high but not really euphoric. Two days later i did 60mg in total and didn't really even get high.  Is this all related to my speed tolerance and damage of my dopamine/serotonin levels?

When i finally take a break, how long do i have to wait? Any tips for helping restore my dopamin/seratonin lvls? Will all the small fuck ups just build the tolerance right back up, or does it just go slower down?  Any related  experiences  would be great, or some tips/facts!

I definitely do not want to inhale this stuff but I see people posting online about doing this. Also, the natives who use this as an entheogen use a naturally occurring form of sodium hydroxide. My question: how are these people not burning out their nostrils and going to the ER? Is there some chemical reaction happening i'm not aware of that is rendering the lime harmless?

Previously, he had not questioned anything about my use of the medication. No pill counts. Didn't ask to see the prescription bottle. Did not drug test me. Nothing like that whatsoever. The other day I had to go into the office to pick up the prescription in person, which I have done before sometimes. Admittedly, my tone of voice when they asked me to come in to pick it up because the doctor is out of town likely showed a little bit of trepidation.

This was not because of anything to do with being reluctant to present myself in the office or anything. Rather, I wasn't exactly happy about having to go into a doctor's office, because of the virus. Of course, they weren't open. But I didn't think that part of it through right away. So, when they said I needed to come in, I was a little nervous at first until I realized that there would most likely not be any sick people in the waiting room. Anyways, when I got there, they asked me to sign a form (e.g. treatment contract) and asked for a piss test.

They had never done either of those things before. I have been *mostly* taking the Adderall exactly as prescribed. As you may expect, I have taken slightly more at times. But I've never used it for recreational purposes, binged on it, used it to stay up for an extended period of time, or anything like that. I have at times taken an extra capsule, and sometimes would run out of it maybe 4 days early or so. Though, I've never run through my script in a couple of weeks or anything like that.

However, as I said sometimes I would run out of it maybe 3-4 days early or so. Which was just enough time for the med to not be in my system when I got piss tested. I specifically said to the nurses that I had not taken it in a couple of days, because the doctor did actually advise me to take tolerance breaks though (when I was prescribed Adderall IR). But I would assume that he would have no problem with this with the XR either. Today, the nurse called me with my lab results, saying that the fact that I didn't have it in my system was a ""red flag"".

Because I fill my prescription every month. In other words, that if I take breaks I should not be filling it every month if I have a supply. I'm a bit nervous about my upcoming appointment, and I have to say that I find this whole situation strange for so many reasons. Another very weird thing happened this time I filled my script. He strangely wrote the script wrong, giving me a 60 day supply instead of a 30 day supply. I thought that he was writing the script for two months instead of one for some reason.

But in the context of this, it's really odd. I will also add that there's nothing about my behavior that has been suspicious in any way. I have never asked for an early refill. I've never acted strangely during visits or anything, because like I said I have never used the stuff to get high or anything. There really would be nothing that would seem to come across as a red flag. Then, all of a sudden I'm asked to sign a contract, piss tested, and strangely given what appears to be a 60 day supply instead of a 30 day supply.

This was pointed out during the phone call today. My response to that was to literally ask them if they ""want them back"" (which I guess isn't the right way to say it, since the pills came from the pharmacy and not the doctor's office of course). But still, ""do want the extra ones back"" doesn't sound like something an addict or drug dealer would say lol. Her response to me saying this was to bring the extras to the appointment with me. However, I plan to actually go a step further than this and bring the whole supply.

To show I have nothing to hide. And of course, make sure that the count is exactly what it should be. In case I am piss tested again, I'll also be sure that I am taking it for my bloodwork/urinalysis appointment and also for the physical. And I'll be sure to keep the pill count consistent with what I say. As for why the sudden suspicion, there is one possibility. Though, I cannot prove or disprove it exactly. I don't take Adderall for recreational purposes, but I have used propylhexedrine for recreational purposes in recent times.

Especially for a good while during the quarantine. For one thing, I was a bored out of my mind. And I had probably 20-30 empty inhalers and spent cottons in my bag. Which my dad had noticed the day that I had gone to the doctor's office to pick up the script that day. He seemed a bit concerned about this and understandably so. I do have some suspicion that perhaps he called the doctor's office and said something about this, but nothing was mentioned about this on the phone call or thus far.

If they did do this, I guess it wouldn't be necessarily malicious or anything, because I can see that this would likely be concerning to them. And perhaps he was legitimately wondering if I was endangering myself. Obviously, I don't want to lose my script though. That would suck. But my more serious fear is being arrested. I do wonder if there is any possibility that the doctor may tell the police that he suspects I am using/selling drugs. And then when I go to the appointment, I may be arrested and taken to jail. I live in the southern US if that makes any difference.

I'm kind of thinking the whole getting arrested at the appointment thing is probably paranoid, with HIPPA and all. But as a somewhat innately paranoid and mistrusting guy like myself, I kind of wonder how much the law on paper is really even followed very well in this age of corruption and death. Especially since if somebody is going to get fucked over, it'd probably be me. I got arrested on fake charges once before. So, the idea of that happening again would not fucking surprise me entirely to be honest.

But I'm guessing this is probably just my natural paranoia talking here. Or at least hoping that. What are your thoughts on this? I'm guessing or at least hoping that I'm just paranoid on this, because of HIPPA and all especially. Plus, I **didn't sell anything** and have never had any intention to. And I don't think taking slightly more than prescribed like that is even a crime anyways. As for the losing my script thing, I'll make sure I have an extra couple. And just say that I take a break every now and then on occasion.

And my pill count would indicate that as it'll be like a couple more than I'm supposed to have. Sometimes, I've filled my script slightly late. It hasn't been a pattern of early fills, and the having a couple left would be indicative of the ""occasional break"" given my pattern of refills over the last year. I did not go back farther than that, as prior to last June, they'd be expired. So, if I were asked about that, I'd say I got rid of them because they were expired. Even if I did lose my script, I'd be able to deal with the situation I think. Probably anyways.

I did just fine without my Adderall before, and I'm guessing I could again. In fact, I'm sure I could. Plus, there's a good chance I'd be able to get another doctor to write me a script. But even if not, it'd be fine. Or basically fine anyways I'd think. I guess. I guess my bigger fear at the moment is getting arrested when I go into the appointment, but I'm guessing, thinking that this wouldn't be a concern. Yet I don't really know the law all that well. So, that is definitely a concern in my mind.

I've been reading about people using Bupropion (Wellbutrin) as an ampetamine-like drug. However, it seems that everyone who does this crushes the ER pill and then takes it by insufflation (snorting). I'm very hesitant about snorting medications, and would like to avoid this if at all possible.

My question is: Will simply crushing the pill, and then taking it orally, subvert the extended-release aspect of the medication? Is snorting the crushed pill the only way to get the stimulant effects?

Thanks,

I'm ex addict. Coke / Meth / MDMA were on almost daily basis. My mother found out about my drug addiction. First i lied to her that i only smoke weed, but with time everything came out.
Usually i have pretty much 'shameless character' with or without drugs.. since i know myself. Lying and manipulating everyone around me wasn't big deal for me, and if it happens my mother to be the person i'm manipulating / lying jeez one eye contact is enough to melt her heart. Buuut she found out about other things (meth, coke and etc.) and stopped trusting me because i almost dropped a tear while trying to convice her i only smoke weed.
From that moment i couldnt look at her eyes. Either lying or telling the truth (most likely lying). Still i was pretty good student. Was my last year, did pretty good on exams, finished with decent mark and was 9 months into drugs already so you cant say that typical shit that 'it only helps first time/s',...
What my mother did really suprised me. I thought that i have 30 days to leave the house, which i didnt really feel like home at this time. (30 so i have enough time to find a job, get salary, move out).
Nope.. She asked me how long i've been into drugs. At this moment i found no point to lie. I got super nervous and wanted to yell at her and grab my 3 points of meth while she is holding them and questioning me. But deep down i knew i'm addict and thank god i'm not high school drop out and even got accepted in decent university (for which we will talk again) while i was druggie, went on third day for my university exam (for acceptance). So my mother against all the odds and comments from family members that already gave up on me, she gave me a hand and protected me from their criticism. Yeah i kept doing drugs after that, but not with the same idea or even fun in the high. My mother did cut me (she would buy me ciggarates and give me money exactly for 1 coffee somewhere out which in my country is between 0.75 to 1€. Wouldnt give me money for anything else, no clubs (where i dont even get high, i would rather alcohol), no money for eating outside, would talk to our mm idk the word, but the teacher which is responsible for 1 given class about the money we have to collect for the upcoming prom (not sure how it's outside europe, but here after high school (12th grade / 18 yo old) we do the prom. She wanted to get confirmation about every one cent she is giving me, i had to bring either the coffee bill or that 1 euro. That was her way, she told me i got 1 chance so better dont screw it. I was really close with my dealer, so before meeting friends for coffee and walk, i would do a line or two, maybe 3 with my dealer and then head for other activities. I still couldnt watch my mom in the eyes while saying i'm drug free since it came out and she believe me or atleast i thought so. That shitty feeling of shame and disappointment killed me. No high could replace my life neither be the reason why my mom cried everynight.. When i heard her crying usually i would cry silently, but without realizing why, it's not big deal to do drugs. Look at me how good my life is? I will win my mother's trust back and she may give me fifty cents without questioning where i'm spending them. At this very moment i realized i lived in denial. I knew what was the problem, but in my eyes and my mind there was no problem. It was all overreacting by people..Was it? Then i decided and said i'm gonna intoxicate my body only with alcohol and weed (I have chrnoic insomnia since 11 years old, and weed helps it tho /NOT EXCUSE - i didnt even smoke in these times (2 periods of insomnia) /) and that's it.
Now you might me wondering why i didnt just say with 2 words what happened and instead i'm making you read all of this? So you can see my / OUR point of view. Yes i at the end quit. My mother asked me 2 weeks after that if i'm better. I actually was proud of myself and told her yes in the eyes. She told me 'Now i trust you' and hugged me. She explained me that since she said she aint going to trust me all because of drugs, since then i never looked her again in the eyes, because i knew the truth and as much as i wanted to lie like before i couldnt do it because the truth is killing me inside because the truth is i'm still addicted - so tbh idk if its exactly due that, but i agreed. I was curious about the 'only one chance' and she asked me if i felt shame for doing drugs after it. I actually did and said yes, and i guess that was the point and that topic never came back. We ignore what happened and rn i dont even want to get drunk or whatever.
So dear parents. I know the struggles you are going through. There is no point of yelling, fighting your kid for his substance abuse. You will get him pissed off and actually set him in a mood to do drugs and self isolate (EVEN MORE).
Pretend you trust him. I mean,  dont make problems for the slightliest lies. They are part from the addiction. If you pretend you trust him ( DONT TRUST WITH MONEY) in the beggining he will take you for fool and laugh at you. Soon enough he will realize that you dont trust a shit he says. Congratulate him for the things he does too, but when he actually do em (and its outside drug cycle). Like throwing trash, etc..Basic things. I can say about me and almost every teen addict that we love and heck even get rush when we are told we did great. With it ask him random things, if he lie to you (for example that he did his homework idk) ask him to check it, say that you are concerned about his education and if needed you might consider homelessons, if he goes with a lie about it, what happened to it or another excuse.. He lies, but dont yell. Say 'it happens, i get it' but in a different way when you congratulate him. He will feel the difference and soon enough seek that approval more and more. And trust me if he had his homework and you wanted to check it he for sure will bring it, because you understimated him and think he is dumb now and therefor will do his best to proove you wrong and get that smile on his face. That's just example with the homework, you know your kid.
If you have problems approaching him for his substance use aka addiction, maybe try to get educated on the topic first. Getting information from drug rehabs and their shitty ass websities wont help you. Better read here to actually get what the drug is doing to his / her mind and all the stuff about it. Dont trust medias and how they portrate addicts, because the truth is.. Nobody knows person like that irl or maybe it's onetime in life to see someone like that. I can even answer your questions and help you more than rehab sites..Also please, dont go for the gateway drug (weed) how all if it started from it, but we dont feel its effects and get smth harder. First that's ridiculous. How would i miss the effects of deppresant and try to obtain em back with stimulants?. First time i did coke was while on 2 day holiday with friends to beach. I didnt do with them, but girl i ended hooking up. Next time was around new year holidays and etc.. I didnt really do it because weed, because i was smoking for 2.5years and never thought of doing hard shit. So dont say that 'myth' - It's pissing us off. Try to get into our live, without making us notice it, ask what is wrong when your beloved kid is nervous and offer him help, to think it out together and such things. Find the reason for it. My reason was pure coping skills with grief i believe, because in that kind of period i crossed 'i use-i abuse' line which is really thin btw. Also mothers are better of handling it, if you are alone father with child due whatever reason, grandma might help. If in your case even that is impossible, i suggest therapist. But dont force him to go. Offer him, explain that you are poorly educated on that topic and no matter how much you read you will never truly understand him. Imo people at all in general are more opened for their feelings and share about their emotional struggles with woman. With fathers atleast we (boys) talk about  insecurities about our future which is not something that is valid for everyone just stating my opinion. Ah also dont forget to dont make him extra anxious first week till his body refreshes and he has a bit more control over his actions. P. S i wanted to quit long enough but i ended up buying again, and always hoped that oneday my family will find out and help me, because shame was too big and admitting as idea sounds painful. If you want tell-tale signs : he isolates, might get in toilet to 'shit' quite more often, if smoker - try to count his ciggarates night and recount in the morning to check if he slept. Red glassy eyes, tweaking (focusing too much on one single thing for hours), his eating regyme, changes in weight, if items are missing (i sold my brand watch/pc monitor/phone). Dont make problem for sold items tho, brain rewires itself and obtaining drug is like filling the fridge with food - one watch or say stolen 20 dollars from your wallet is something he will apologize alone if you did your job right and missing items are your least problem. Dont blame yourself if he ignores you and asks you only for money and you are no longer parent, but ATM. In my case i broke my live in denial and found how deep in the shit i'm. If you are lucky your child will realize it too and quit. Nobody has ever quit drugs with force. When he decides, then. Meanwhile support him, and dont think he is blaming you for it. If he does, just another try for manipulation if you didnt abuse him ofc. If it's about financial family status, being below avarage, having no items as other people his age and due that he befriended junkies which led to drugs- tell him to shut up, because meanwhile he would work on his life, saving for university and etc.. And by coming back to university - if you catch your kid parachuting adderal in america and most likely meth or amphetamines in europe with the reason i have to study whole night and go to school and etc.. Close your eyes, try to explain that he wouldnt need drugs to study if he did that on time (i have friend which was in that situation). Parachuting is barely a way addict will choose..smoking / snorting in home, but parachuting? Na. Overall be open minded and dont try as long as you have to bring back your child. The person you watch is not him. He is somewhere in the backseat of his mind, he feels guilt but cant express it. With time these bad emotions in combination with drugs lead to suicide, before kicking your now adult kid you may open the coffin for him. Always support them, if they are about to do something wrong try to say why they musnt, like you care and try to search different option with him. If he dies due his addiction just accept that it's all his fault. We all know it might happen with every dose and know the risks. You as parent stayed devoted to your kid. You gave him roof over his head, food and ensured him great life. You know that you did the best for him, was always there for him, never gave up on him and always there for him. The addict might OD before he decides to quit. If you kick him from your life, even if he decides to get clean and rebuild his life, he wont feel welcomed in your house. He will realize that it's the end.. How people call it.. Rock bottom? Self realization will enlight him, but he has none left and....

Now, this was not intentional at all. I have been tripping on synthetic noids and other drugs before to the point of having the worst experience of my life once. So I can very well tell when I'm in a sober state and when my mind feels altered. 

I took about 2500 mg l-tyrosine (wanted to merely test the increase in ""natural feeling"" energy tbh as opposed to using Adderall), and it was actually pretty nice. Then I threw in 400 mg of 5-HTP (I used it regularly a long time ago as a supplement and never had issues with it). Much later (let's say about 6 hours or more), I took ibuprofen (about 600 mg) due to my period pain and 2 mg of melatonin since it helps me sleep.

I often have closed eye visuals that are short and cool, but this time, it was different. I closed my eyes, and the visuals began. I saw geometric shapes, eyes, faces, and so forth. It went on and on and suddenly, something creepy appeared. I opened my eyes because I got scared. Anxious as hell at this point. Anyway, I closed them again and the visuals continued to the point where I thought I couldn't control my thoughts tbqh. They were unusually fast (but not as insanely fast that one time I tripped on noids). 

One of the scariest images I can think of appeared, and I got super fucking scared again. I suddenly felt my heart beating everywhere and experienced heart palpitations, and I was feeling very uncomfortably hot under my blanket. Reluctantly, I closed my eyes again... and of course, something in my mind jump scared me. At this point, I took my phone and tried to watch a few YouTube videos, but all the faces of the people I saw in the videos looked... evil. This time around, I actually fell asleep after I closed my eyes because I was just too goddamn tired. 

It felt like I couldn't control my thoughts at all, honestly. Like, things I never think of appeared in my mind, almost as if it were subconscious memories of movies or people I saw... I had no control.

It’s long and not super action packed, but I’ll never forget it.  

A little background: this was ~3 years ago, and I’m not quite as reckless as I was back then. Took place in philly with my late childhood friend. We were 20 or 21. 


So I traveled to philly to visit my friend at temple, and to also pick up 10 tabs of some acid that he blotted himself. I was staying the night, and I was expecting him to offer me some substances to have a good time with while I was there. But he didn’t have too much at that time, which was pretty surprising. 

He felt a little bad so he offered me a line, and I took him up on his offer. This was my first time ever trying coke, so I just trusted him to give me a reasonable dose (looking back it was a pretty fat ass line). Again, it was my first time so I wasn’t really sure what I was feeling. A couple minutes later I was sped the fuck up, and asked him if he wanted to trip with some of the L I was buying from him. He said ‘uh that doesn’t really sound like a good combination, but if you want to I’ll join you.’

I thought it over for a minute and then we decided to go through with it. Laid the tab on my tongue and I was locked in...but I had no idea what was to come.

On the come up, we each had another two or three lines, and also a couple beers. The come up is the most blurry part, and I barely remember any of it. Eventually, I really started tripping balls and it was going alright. We had another 2 lines and some more beer, and I was getting really fucked rapidly. I’d say this is pry 1.5 hours in. Obviously my perception of time was obliterated tho, so I cant say for certain, and this part is still pretty fuzzy. 

I think next we decided to rip a bong a little bit, and then take another line. 

And this is where it starts going downhill. 

I remember sitting on his couch, and I noticed my heart going absolutely insane. It was the only thing I could hear, and I was so fucked I literally couldn’t even tell if it was beating fast. It most certainly was, but I couldn’t even fathom the duration of a second enough to try to count the beats. 

I envisioned myself stranded in the middle of an ocean, struggling to swim. My head was bobbing in the waves. I thought to myself “I did this to myself. I’m stranded here more fucked than I have ever been, and it’s my fault and my fault alone. There is no escape. Don’t panic. Just ride it out.”

My heart continued race, and I was beginning to lose any sense of being grounded to reality. My vision was distorting and any amount of moving made me feel nauseous. I texted my friend (who was right next to me) because I didn’t want to alarm his roommates: “I’m not feeling right, can we get some fresh air?”

So we stepped outside to his little fenced in porch, and I tried to collect myself. He was a lot more seasoned in both L and coke than me, and I think he might have realized we went a little buck wild for my first time doing lines. He apologized and said “yeah that was probably way too much coke for your first time.” I laughed. It was reassuring for some reason. I told him it was good, and then apologized for not being able to keep my cool. We stood there for a while, and the breeze was nice. I had my eyes closed...and then there was a gunshot. It was probably a block or two away. And instead of feeling afraid, I felt safe. The sound rushed past me like waves on the shore, and it echoed for seemingly forever in my head. 

I have no idea why it made me feel temporarily at ease, but it did. And I’ll never forget that moment. So powerful, so destructive, but beautiful. 

We went back inside, and for some reason I thought it would be good to smoke some more green. I guess because it usually chills me out, but I should have known better when mixing it with tripping. The visuals went nuts after this. 

My friend put on the movie in bruges. Spoiler alert: I didn’t remember a single scene, line, or character from that movie and I ‘watched’ the entire thing. 

My visuals were so intense that I couldn’t even see. I would try to watch the movie, but the character’s faces would endlessly melt into oblivion until I was seeing a competent different reality. It would have been pretty cool if I could control it. I was stuck in loops of trying to get a grasp on reality by watching the movie, but then it would melt and distort until it was a completely different and nonsensical color explosion. 

I had tripped pretty hard prior to this, but nothing even close to what I was experiencing at that moment. The movie lasted for an eternity, and I was still just as fucked as when it started. For the entire duration I feared I was going to have an actual heart attack, and I begged to be sobering up.

After the movie ended, random shit was happening. Like someone showed up to smoke a bowl and buy some green. And this is when I realized I couldn’t speak. I tried to say something to him and no words came out. I can’t even imagine how fucked I must have seemed to him. But he didn’t make a big deal out of it which was nice. 

He chilled for a bit and smoked a blunt. I took a couple puffs cause I’m a fiend for a backwood, even at my worst. Eventually he left and my friend was talking to his roommate. I was included in the conversation too, but I still couldn’t formulate a thought or sentence. 

I’d say roughly 5 hours after taking the tab, my friend pounded some Benadryl and said he was turning in. I acknowledged, and laid down on the couch. I was still really fucked, but didn’t fear for my life as much. 

I popped in some headphones and started listening to the album honeymoon but lana del rey. And that’s when it hit me. 

The most beautiful come down I have ever experienced. 

It was like lucid dreaming without sleeping. I felt so peaceful and content, and just one with myself. I laid there motionless with practically a smile on my face for hours. I existed only in my mind, and it was so beautiful.

I laid there for probably five hours without moving unless to seldom change music. I said nothing. Eventually I fell asleep for like 1.5 hours, and I awoke in a beautiful afterglow. 

Bonus: while I was laying there on the couch, my friends roommate and his gf came down and were talking for a while. I was just listening to them talk because I was still far too fucked to talk let alone have a conversation. I figured they thought I was fast asleep. At one point like an hour in to their convo, they said (in regards to me) “I wonder if he’s listening to us.” I unintentionally let out a smile and a little chuckle, and then they started laughing. I felt a little weird cause I still couldn’t speak, and I didn’t even open my eyes. I never got to explain what that was all about to them, but I’m hoping they weren’t too freaked out about it. 

If anyone read this whole thing lmk. I’m not the best with describing visuals and feelings, but this experience has stuck with me. I felt like a walked the line between life and death, and I got to live to tell the story.

I however didn't take it for a while because I thought my panic attacks were under control however they re-appeared and for the past two weeks I've been taking it on and off. 

It's been around 13 days since I began and I took in total around 1.5mg. I was prescribed 0.5 a day in two doses, but I took half of a single dose once a day except one day where I took the full 0.25. So basically I was taking 0.125 on and off for few days, then took a 0.5 once and then again 0.125 for few days. I think around 8-9 days in total with few days skipped in this two week period. All and all should be around 1.5mg across these days.

The pill I am referring to for this is the circular pale yellow one with 18 on one side

OROS is a bitch and a half getting past... but if you have these simple things you can get right on your way to having basically pure mph powder that can be used for just about any ROA

Metal clipper nail file/multi tool file
(Do a google search of “leatherman file” I find that that they work best) 

Paper towel or cloth

Razor blade (a coke razor will do)

Sheet of printer or loose leaf Paper (for crushing pill; optional)


Step one: put pill in your mouth and let it sit there for a few seconds to get the yellowish coating off

Step two: Pat your pill dry with paper towel or cloth

Step three: With two fingers and a strong pinch, hold your pill flat in your fingers and begin to file around the edge. Collect the coating that you are filing off somewhere for when you are done with this guide

*NOTE*: move in sections around the pill, and stop filing each section once you see a rough powdery area appear at the center of where you were filing (if you keep filing that section you will just waste powdered mph)

 Step 4: once you have filed down to the powder in a straight band all around the pill, Put the pill down on your sheet of paper or whatever you will use to crush the pill, and then use your finger nail or the razor to peel off the waxy coating remaining on the pill

Set aside the coating somewhere for when you are done with this guide

Step 5: with your remaining pill, which at this point should be a rough powdery disk, fold your paper in half twice to form a corner, and put your pill in that corner 

Step 6: with your teeth or two hard surfaces, crush the pill to a fine powder

If you are using your teeth, be careful to not tear the paper, so go slow when biting the corner

Step 7: pour the powder into a container of your choice for later use, or pour it onto a flat hard surface like a mirror, and ready your nostrils for that sweet mph burn

So I just now realized that i have an eye appointment in like 4 hours today. I'm only 4hrs into my high microdose or more likely considered low dose lsd trip. When I got home I found out my eyes are fully dialated. I'm worried that when I go to my eye appointment this will be questioned into an issue by my doctor... It took my a really long time to get this appointment scheduled due to the Corona virus and I really do not want to reschedule and wait months again for an appointment. Can i still go? Will it cause my doctor to not wanna give me an exam? Is there any excuse I can provide to my doctor that is believable that caused my eyes to dialate and he will continue with give me the eye exam I need? Any advice would help.. i am likely going to show up so please try to come up with some good believable excuses I could potentially use. My idea right now is to say i just got in a major car accident an hour before and was in shock which caused my eyes to dialated so much i believe.

People who have spent their whole lives thinking the cops are good and to be trusted are waking up to the fact that the police are a dangerous, violent, racist gang that lie, cheat, steal and kill with impunity.

And it all comes down to the war on drugs.

The war on drugs created no-knock raids like the one that killed Breonna Taylor so that cops could kick down doors before suspects could flush drugs.

The war on drugs created civil forfeiture that is used to pillage from minorities so that cops could confiscate cash from suspected drug dealers.

The war on drugs is the reason for the steady erosion of the 4th amendment and the move towards an authoritarian police state.

But the public is missing this!

This is your opportunity to do something about an issue that has probably affected you your whole life, that others have ignored.

Right now, one of the [top sellers on amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/New-Jim-Crow-Incarceration-Colorblindness/dp/1620971933) is a book written by a Black woman about how the war on drugs is a racist effort to replace Jim Crow laws with a new form of systematic oppression against people of color. If you don't have time to read the whole book, see the Wikipedia overview: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_New\_Jim\_Crow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow) (especially ""Though the conventional point of view holds that systemic racial  discrimination mostly ended with the civil rights movement reforms of  the 1960s, Alexander posits that the U.S. [criminal justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice) system uses the [War on Drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs) as a primary tool for enforcing traditional, as well as new, modes of discrimination and oppression. "")

Right now, people are watching cops kill and main their fellow citizens in a desperate attempt to assert their authority.

This is the opportunity to wake people up to the lies they have been fed their whole life! They didn't care about what they saw as ""filthy junkie scum"" but they might care when they see that black people are arrested for drug crimes at 3 times the rate of white people, despite similar levels of usage.

See: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/06/04/the-blackwhite-marijuana-arrest-gap-in-nine-charts/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/06/04/the-blackwhite-marijuana-arrest-gap-in-nine-charts/)

People wonder why the police have military gear? Point out to them they are waging war on black market drug trafficking organizations that are also highly funded and have military gear. Point out that the best way to de militarize and de-fund the police is to not give them a reason to militarize in the first place. Point out that the cops don't no-knock raid the Budweiser CEO's home.

Point out that the war on drugs funnels young black people into the school-to-prison pipeline, and keeps them in a cycle of crime and strife. Point out how much damage the war on drugs has done to minority communities, while it spares white communities.

Talk to your friends and family, post on social media, attend a protest with a ""End the racist war on drugs"" sign, write to your representatives and tell them the points I just gave you.

Appreciate any insight or advice, whatever. Thanks


Ever since I was younger I was depressed as shit, trauma and ptsd probably. Everyday I see some shitty memories and my mind is such a dark place and it gets worse, worse and worse and drugs are obviously not helping (kinda).


Im not addicted to anything right now but have been to benzos heavily and weed, then just anything I can get high with. Little stims too. 


I have tried being sober for some time, some time only smoking weed. I think about death/suicide kinda every day, I feel like im not going to last long honestly

I got to benzos/weed/alcohol at 16. 17 more heavily and experimenting pills and other shit. 18 I really started using since I got my own apt. 

Now my usage is the most down it has been and my urges are not that strong but life is hell.

3 months and im 20. When I was 15/16 I tried killing myself with pills and alcohol but didnt work. 

My life outside looking is perfect I guess. I got my own businesses and lot of money so I can buy any drugs and smoke weed constantly, my own apartment.

I have no motivation to do anything, just smoke weed do drugs and order some food and play video games or just chill. I socialize maybe twice a week max, I wanna be alone constantly.


I know why I do drugs. Emotional pain, depression, anxiety. I am not diagnosed PTSD or depression but im pretty sure I have it. Diagnosed ADHD only.

Insomnia which relates to anxiety/ptsd too. One dark thought while trying to sleep could delay it by like 2 hours and i feel horrible. Overthinking. Sleeping too much or too little. Too many problems.

If im at the gym having a good time listening to music a bad memory will appear to my head and I cant stop thinking about it and it ruins my whole mood or even day.


I have never talked to anyone about my problems. I have been to a therapist couple times but I cant open up to them. Writing this already got me almost in tears since the darkness comes again in my mind thinking about this. 

I can’t talk about my darkness to anyone I just cant do it at least not right now, I’m the only one who understands me. I can only help myself.

I don’t know what to do. Some days are really dark I seriously think would it be better if I died, but I don’t wanna quit. I dont wanna hurt my mom and my brother when its already hard in my family. 

Only thing why I havent killed myself is that and then its me having a little hope inside me. I don’t wanna die but I also dont want to live most of the time and I am scared one day its too bad and something will happen, just being real.

I already when taking drugs (Percocet maybe 2-3 times a month) I take as much as I can. I got no tolerance and took 45mg and chainsmoked like 10 joints and passed out. Xanax? Maybe 5mg and shit ton of weed.

Just weed? Get high as possible most of the time. just try to chase the highest high and I know it and often I dont care.


I have thinking of maybe moving to another country, starting a completely new life, new me type thing.

But me and another friend are very keen to trip especially since our drinking has gone way out of hand since bars reopened. 

So we're thinking about doing a smaller dose this weekend for the first time for a bit of fun and to test the waters. 

Thing is, the last few months I've developed social anxiety and my general mental health isn't at its best. 

Is it a good idea to do half a tab, or maybe a third in a maybe less controlled environment? 

What will the effects be and duration?

This petition has a scheduled hearing in the Canadian House of Commons later this year where it will be presented by Green Party MP, Paul Manly. From reports that I have read online, this petition will require upwards of **500,000 signatures** by **August 14th** for it to be something that is taken seriously by our Canadian officials. This is something that is achievable if we use the combined efforts of our reddit/subreddit communities, and personal social media to raise awareness for this petition and psychedelic medicine in general.\n\nThere are a number of studies that show promising medicinal benefits of psychedelics for various mental illnesses, alzheimers, and as addiction treatment. When combined with cognitive behavioural therapy, it has been shown that a psychedelic trip under the guidance of a therapist can sometimes equate to 10 years of standard therapy. For alzheimers, studies have shown that microdosing in late middle age can lower the risk of dementia by more than half; and has been shown to be an effective treatment for mitigating the effects of those already suffering dementia. In terms of addictions, psychedelics have shown to be an effective treatment for opioid addictions and may one day replace opioids for the purposes of general anesthetic altogether.\n\nThis being said, under the current system most research revolving around psychedelics are either under funded or blocked by bureaucratic red tape. Through decriminalization, we take a step forward towards destigmatizing psychedelics, and allowing research to be more readily conducted, therefore advancing the potential of modern medicine and treatment.\n\nSo here is what you can do to help.\n\nFor **Canadians,** please sign the petition if this is something that you support.

If you choose to sign it, please be sure to share it with your family, friends and loved ones. The more support we can get the better. If you can make a post about it on social media, please do so. We have until August to make decriminalization a reality.\n\nFor **Non-Canadians**, you can help by raising awareness for the healing potential of psychedelics within your own communities and social circles. If we can start a conversation about smart, responsible drug use for the purposes of health and medicine, we will start to walk in the direction of making psychedelics more socially accepted. You can also start your own efforts, lobbying your own local governments and communities to create a petition similar to the one that is currently in Canada. Decriminalization shouldn’t just be a Canadian phenomenon, nor should speech about responsible psychedelic use.\n\nTo close, please support this petition however you can. As once we get the ball rolling on this, we can get the world talking about Canada’s new policies, legitimizing our claim to ground breaking medicinal treatments around the globe. Ultimately, none of this inherently means that psychedelics will be made available recreationally, however it might open the doors for real positive change in medicine and health care.\n\nI will be working with some people to continue this awareness campaign on Facebook and Instagram @ rationalpsychedelics.

Ever so often I use adrafinil/Modafinil aswell but it's too rare to worth mentioning. 

At the moment or generally 1-2 hours before starting studying I take 10mg MPH (XR beads crushed, measured and put in a capsule to create same conditions as an IR pill). So far I get pretty much same (side)effects as described in nearly all literature. Worst being occasional nausea and heart palpitations. Also, I care about my usage and don't use it for a long time, no more than 20 days with maybe one day break per week. 

I noticed an ongoing nausea and mild anxiety for weeks to months when I stop using it and it is more than a usual WD. Years ago, I fucked up first time experimenting with the dosage and had bad comedowns and WD . But this time it's worse and it's an ongoing process with no end in sight. After some research I couldn't find a reason for it and am asking you guys for help and an explanation of what is going on and how to stop/prevent it. 

Also using OTC nausea medication didn't help and trying a slight potent dopamine antagonist also had no effects on nausea. As a short term solution I could fight off the anxiety with tram/benzos but it would potentiate the nausea which would be not a viable option.

I've written an article for The Independent about Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder, or HPPD. It's a pretty rare (but very real) condition that affects some users of psychedelic drugs. It's better-known as 'flashbacks': when the effects of a drug like LSD or magic mushrooms persist beyond the trip. It encompasses a whole range of sometimes-wild effects, including full-blown visuals, bodily excitations, and distortions to conceptual thinking.

I thought some people in the community might want to give it a read.

Among other details, my article features a history of HPPD that stretches back to the 19th-century; several real-life case studies; discussions of HPPD's link to psychosis, alcohol abuse and suicide; and what the condition may mean for the promise of future psychedelic research.

You can read it on The Independent here: [https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/long-reads/netflix-good-bad-trip-lsd-psychedelics-never-wears-off-a9533136.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/long-reads/netflix-good-bad-trip-lsd-psychedelics-never-wears-off-a9533136.html) 

It's behind a paywall, but you can create a temporary account through Google or Facebook pretty quickly. If you'd rather skip that, you can read a less fancy-looking version here on Pastebin: [https://pastebin.com/R9jy1NWV](https://pastebin.com/R9jy1NWV)

Thanks - enjoy. Let me know what you think.

I kept telling myself after this cart I’m gunna quit, so I finally ran out of the cart a few days ago and haven’t smoked since. Being high or hungover from weed feels more normal then being sober. Since I stopped smoking I’ve been out more and been way happier. I’m not sure if it’s just me trying harder to get out or just not having that afterglow/hungover effect, but I certainly feel way better.

Of course, there are others who have it worse, but I've been through some shit. I've used drugs to cope with those things, like many people have. At 18, I fell into the classic case of being stuck in a mental hospital and getting hooked on the free cigarettes they gave out. I've been nicotine dependent ever since. 

I've gotten over small bouts of drug dependency and addiction and other horrible coping mechanisms, and now I just use a juul and smoke weed sometimes. I would like to quit vaping, and I have a few times, but now is just not a good time in my life to put myself through that again. 

I am so sick and goddamn tired of people making me feel bad for vaping. I am not proud of it, I do not think it looks cool, I am just dependent on a LEGAL drug. I never smoke in front of people, but my friends make me feel like crap when I come back from a smoke break. Which I take maybe every few hours. People on dating apps make me feel BAD for vaping/smoking. I understand preference and not wanting to date someone that has a different lifestyle, but damn... can you not make me feel like shit about one of my healthier coping mechanisms??

It's a legal drug. They sell them at the counter in grocery stores and gas stations. Can we please stop shaming people for smoking??? We all know it's bad for you.

It started off kind of small 100ugs to 200 to 500 ugs then back down to 300. 

Then one day my usual plug posts he has something called ace I was under the impression it was just straight up shrooms and we did 60 mg which I thought was about and 8th or more of shrooms come to find out that’s a heroic dose after I did some research. 

and it was a very fun night for the most part it was me and my best friend and we were just talking watching really cool videos I found and listening to Mac Miller lil peep and juice wrld my favorite rappers at the time I couldn’t listen to Mac Miller for a while after this but anyway, it was one of the most amazing nights of my life the vibes were amazing the visuals were insane.

  we would be talking for what felt like an hour and I’d look at him and would say bro it’s been 7  MINUTES it just felt like we were so interested in everything each other was saying. It was a very good night we were taking dabs out of my dab rig used so much was then I felt like I was tripping HARD like HARD HARD The hardest I’ve tripped in my life. 

this was around the peak and I felt like I needed to brush my teeth because of the candy we ate and I did that and washed my hands and I accidentally looked up and saw myself in the mirror and I saw myself but it wasn’t me and I started to totally freak the fuck out and things went in a downward spiral. 

and I accidentally did it again and said “hey buddy” and after that I felt like everything was A simulation and 1 million thoughts in a second and I just couldn’t comprehend life and the time and the fact that we live in a three dimensional world but we can only see in two dimensions and it felt like everything looked weird like I looked at my hands and my body and I just couldn’t understand any of it and I felt like one day I would die and I would wake up and this was all just a dream or if any of you have ever seen the episode of Rick and Morty where they play the Roy video game and they live that guys  life out, that’s what I felt like was happening to me.

And I just constantly kept thinking about death and it had a whole new meaning to me but I was scared to die but I was also scared to live forever I didn’t know what I wanted and after that it took me a while to come back to reality and I’m still not all the way there and it made me not be able to smoke weed anymore or ever want to do psychedelics ever again.

and so I started doing hard drugs doing cocaine Xanax you name it but it all just made it worse it made me have even more depersonalization I’m on right now but I struggled with cocaine for a while and I’m sober now for the most part I still vape use nicotine.

My dad and I have had many conversations about drugs and alcohol, and he's never mentioned doing meth to me but I thought maybe he would be embarrassed to tell me for some reason?

This conversation that my mom and I had has been weighing on my mind lately because my dad did show me his teeth one time a long time ago, and he had 2 that were incredibly rotten but none of his other teeth are messed up. I know about meth mouth but I can't find anything about whether or not it could be isolated like that where it's only a few teeth that are messed up.

I will never understand why some people can become a whole different person on alcohol. Does this mean I will control myself well on Xanax too? I’m a little bit concerned as I read a lot of bartard stories where people say it’s practically impossible to control their actions. My plan is to take recreational doses 1-3 times a week so I don’t get addicted. I tried Xanax a few times before and it’s super euphoric for me.

Recently, I've found that my evening dose actually revs me up a little (in the best way possible). Like I feel tired at 7, pop my zop, and feel wide awake and anxiety free after like half hour. This usually lasts until I redose right before bed (4ish hours later).

Is this normal? I'm concerned this might be the beginning of addiction or something... I know alcohol (a depressant) often works like a stim for people that have become dependent on it or use it as a social crutch. Any advice on how to approach zopiclone moving forward?

Soooo not so long ago I was heavily abusing the benzodiazepine Xanax to the eventual point that I could not put any amount into my body without causing a blackout. Shoot forward about 6th months into the future and I went to treatment and stopped using Xanax completely. Then, and I’m not making excuses just telling the story how it happened, I went to a psychiatrist to deal with some anxiety issues that had been brought up by the current global state of affairs. I told him I would not take any Xanax as I had a history of addiction and he said fine and sent me home with clonedine, busbprol, and 8 ativan. I had at the time of both taking the prescription from my doctor to get it filled and then picking it up and then taking some that Ativan was, too, a benzodiazepine. I did not blackout. In fact I took all eight as prescribed without any issues at all.
Soooo my questions are this: 1. Why didn’t I blackout. Ativan is a benzodiazepine, so shouldn’t I have blacked? 2. Does that mean different benzos affect the brain differently? And if so is it safe for me to use Ativan or Valium as needed? 3. Am I safe to take ANY benzos again, including Xanax, without blacking out?

ITS JUST OPINIONS. You like this drug better? Dope! I’m glad you enjoyed it. You didn’t like this drug which I enjoyed? I’m sorry, I wish I could share my experience. Nonetheless. Enjoy:


Cannabis: 10/10 what can I say that hasn’t already been said? It’s the perfect drug, as long as you never try opiates lol. 

Adderall:6/10 if you have a few mundane tasks, nothing makes it easier and less draining than adderall. 

Ritalin:5/10 just a slightly weaker version of adderall. 

MDMA:7/10 great when at a party or with a group of friends you really enjoy the company of. 

Methylone:5.8/10 MDMA without the magic. 

MDA:5.5/10  basically in between methylone and mdma. 

Methamphetamine:9/10 basically if adderall decided to shoot steroids and then od on crack 

Cocaine:6/10 NEED MORE NEED MORE NEED MORE NEED MORE

Crack:9/10 NEED MORE QUICKER RAPIDO OH MY GOD IT SOUNDS LIKE HELICOPTERS I CANT THINK IM GONNA PUKE THIS IS AMAZING 

Heroin:10/10 Everything is perfect. 

Fentanyl:6.5/10 this is nice... and it’s over. 

Oxycodone(including contin):8.5/10 nod.. scratch scratch scratch... nod.. 

Hydromorphone:8.5/10 dilaudid isnt something I wanted to rate so high, but the rush from it IV is something special. The high is basically non existent after the rush, but it just hits all the right notes for those few seconds. An opiate symposium. 

Oxymorphone:10/10 opana is basically the opiate Unicorn. It’s the dilaudid rush with the heroin high. I’d choose this over a Speedball even. 

Morphine:8/10 the one true opiate. 

Methadone:6/10 basically opiate maintenance for people who still wanna get high. 

Buprenorphine:8/10 for those who don’t find the life of heroin to be worth it. 

2cE:7/10 a roller coaster of a drug. Suddenly you’re up feeling like the peak of an mdma experience... then it’s like sober... THEN ITS LIKE YOURE TRIPPING TITS.. rinse repeat. 

2cI:7/10 basically a slightly different version of 2cE

Psilocybin:8-9.5/10 Mushrooms depend on dosage. That time I took 11gs and 100mg of morphine and blacked out? Ehhh I’d rate a 4, but that time I took 5gs and rolled a few blunts and talked about the universe with my best friends? Incomparably 10/10. 

LSD:8/10 acid is like... psilocybin’s little sister. Again it depends on dosage, obviously if you take a 10 strip and compare it to 1g of mushrooms, it’s gonna seem like a colossal giant, but comparably 10 hits of acid and let’s say, 10g of mushrooms? 10 times out of 10 those mushrooms will teach you something you didn’t even know you needed to learn. 

LSA:6/10 blech. There’s a reason you can just go buy Hawaiian baby wood rose seeds 🤢🤮

25i:4/10 it’s like acid’s inbred cousin. She might making you trip, but she’s also your sister. 

Gabapentin:10/10 the end all cure all for most problems. Pain? This. Dope sick? This. Coke comedown, this. Depression? This. Anxiety? This. Can’t sleep? This. The miracle drug. The one thing everyone should have in the arsenal. 

Lyrica:10/10 The big boy version of gabapentin. 

DMT:8/10 NOT TO BE FUCKED WITH. ONLY FOR LEARNING AND DISCOVERING PURPOSES. 

Xanax:4/10 USELESS. Unless you actually have anxiety. 

Klonopin:5.5/10 same, but also my preferable opiate potentiator. Safer. 

Clonazepam:6/10 Same as kpin. 

Nitrous Oxide:7/10 feels like your head is a frisbee. 

Ambien:5/10 IV gives a weird little rush. Take a few orally and meet the walrus 🤷‍♂️

Nicotine:7/10 the devil, but boy does she come in handy when you’re stressed. 

Tramadol:3/10 OPIATE FOR LITTLE KIDS LMFAO 

Seroquel:1.5/10 Disguises itself as an antipsychotic. It’s a zombie inducer. You become useless. 

Ketamine:9/10 Makes everything seem like it’s exactly the way it’s supposed to be, except submerged in water. 

Salvia:2.5/10 oh god One giant hit of this will make you rethink the existence of not god, but all the demons you can imagine. 

Alcohol:1.3/10 literally useless. The only drug that truly should be illegal. Tastes terrible, isn’t fun, lacks sufficient euphoria, makes people dangerous, violent, delusional, gives people false feelings of comfort, masks your emotions.

My buddy had some magic mushrooms he'd been saving for about a week or so. I had never tried them before and I've wanted to for a long time but had no money. I offered him a nice watch (which I happened to unfortunately lose that same night) I never really wore for about 4 grams of shrooms. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before picking up the 2 girls we went to his house to grab a half gram so I could microdose. About 30 minutes in to making out with one of the girls I noticed a very slight euphoric effect, but nothing very intense. About 2 hours later we dropped the girls off and my buddy had offered to just give me the rest of his stash even though I lost the watch I was later gonna trade him for.

&amp;#x200B;

 We drove back to his house and I ate about 4 grams and smoked a few puffs off of his one hitter. Immediately I felt the effects of marijuana intertwining with the mushrooms. I felt very euphoric and every word I said seemed philosophical and brilliant. We drove to the nearest gas station to grab some gas and ask to bum a cigarette off some people. Sadly the man he asked said he had none.

&amp;#x200B;

The sun was about to rise and I was supposed to be asleep at home so he dropped me off at my house where I laid in bed and felt all of the effects I was trying to hold back before I walked into my house. I looked at my wall and saw the magenta lights grow brighter as they seemed to give me a reassuring feeling of happiness. I noticed that my room is beautiful and I loved the position of every item. My walls started develop a pattern overlay that looked like vibrations under a surface covered in water.

&amp;#x200B;

It was about 5 AM and I grabbed a few cigarettes from my dads pack and went to my courtyard to smoke one. To give you a visual of how my courtyard looks: brick floor surrounded by a fence with flowerbeds around the fence (roses, poppy, and big pretty flowers), A large tree, and tons of grass growing in between the floor bricks. The scenery was beautiful and wholesome, in a way. I could see the sun rising while the rest of the sky was still dark and the stars were out. The cigarette felt amazing and gave me an incredible body high. As I smoked this cig I realized exactly how my brain worked. It's like I was looking at a screen of coding that showed my every thought process and how all my though processes begin and end. I felt enlightened and the next day I was a little tired but I was extremely productive.

I fucking love 2-CB!
To set the scene it was me and my friend we were down in my room (which is at the bottom of my garden it’s a big summerhouse so complete privacy) and we were obviously on 2-CB. We had some balloons that we use for nos, however we had more balloons than nos canisters. Anyway we decided to blow up a couple balloons and draw faces on them and give them names. My balloon for whatever reason was called scarlet, and I started to have a bond with scarlet (almost like a pet bond) about an hour passes and I’m holder her in my hand and just POP!! As soon as it happened I looked at my friend and started balling my eyes out, like full on crying about how I’m never going to get her back. I started to feel guilty as I was the one holding her. About 5 minutes passes and I’m still crying. Then all of a sudden like someone flipped a switch I realised I was crying over a balloon. I instantly broke into laughter that made me lose all my motor functions, I fully fell to the ground and just laughed for I don’t even know how long. When I finally came out of it we decided to do a funeral and wished her good luck in the afterlife.

I just wanted to share with you this short but curious experience with Clona. I'm sorry about possible grammar mistakes, since English is not my native language.

A couple years ago I was visiting my aunt. She has some chronic pain conditions, so she was prescribed Clonazepam. So at the time I was left alone at the living room for some minutes, and there I noticed a blister in the table. I've always been quite prone to experiment with mind altering substances so I felt curious and went ahead to check out what were those pills. Boom! Surprise motherf*cker!! I was astonished as I realized they were some legendary clonas. I had heard and read about such drug before, so this was my one and only opportunity whatsoever to try them. So, I took one of them without knowing which was the dose or any of those tiny but REALLY important details.

Time went by, and I felt nothing but disappointment. I came back home and it was time to eat. My mom, my cousin and my grandma were already sat down ready to have lunch. So I sat as well and as I ate, I started feeling some kind of euphoria. This was around 3-4 pm. The next thing I remember was waking up at 11:30 pm laying on my bed. I opened my eyes like WTF??? I still felt pretty sleepy so I went back to sleep. 

The next day my mom and my cousin asked me what the hell happened. But I actually wasn't aware of how the hell I got to my bed in the first place. They told me that I fell asleep while eating... with some food pouring out of my mouth... as disgusting as it sounds. They said they thought I was just messing around with them so they tried to wake me up. Apparently afterwards I tried to answer some texts back to my then girlfriend but I fell asleep AGAIN with the phone on my hand. They realized something was wrong and helped me get to my room for me to sleep till I felt sober again.

Nobody mentioned anything about the incident after that. And today somehow (not worth telling how) I realized that the pill I took was 2 mg of Clonazepam. I don't know if it is a high or low dose, specially for a newbie to this substance.

I'd like to know your opinions on that. How much is it safe to start with? Was it way too much? Or am I just overly sensitive to it?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,684744,public,confidence,self,Blackedout on Clonazepam,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gz7nx1/blackedout_on_clonazepam/,no_ads,0.0,1591677866.0,,,,,,,,,,1591665844.0,,,,,,,,,,,

I saw a website like this, but now I can no longer find it and have searched online and still struggle.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw a website where you can pay \~$150 and send in some 'mystery drug' like Pressed Adderall, XTC, Meth or any other substance.

They will test it and give you the purity and ingredients.

I know I can buy  a kit on [BunkPolice.com](https://BunkPolice.com), but im moreso interested in learning what else is in the pressed pills, and other subtances.

Thanks!

This happened in the past, but not like this, now I'm at the bottom of the bottle...

Like I'm making all these turns and I have to remember which way I went so I can get back out. Or like every turn is the twist of a rubber band, getting tighter and tighter, and I have to untwist it fully to escape the reality I've traveled to and return to my body. Interestingly, I never remember actually finding my way back home (untwisting the rubber band) but I frequently have this strong feeling as I'm going out there that I must remember the way home, must untwist the rubber band to return.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I found myself way out there, having made many turns in the maze, many twists of the rubber band. My memory of this place isn't very good, but I do remember that what I found was unpleasant and I wanted out of there. I had entirely lost contact with my body, but some part of me understood that I was actually lying on my couch. I decided that I could force myself back to my body. I remember saying out loud ""I can just stand up and be back in my body"" and I did. The experience was of the rubber band rapidly untwisting, allowing my consciousness to return to my body. It was not a good thing. I felt as if by taking this shortcut, I was violating the rules, not taking the proper steps to return. But yet, I could force it.

&amp;#x200B;

I returned to my body and felt extremely upset. It was as if I had violated the rules. I had caused a lot of harm to that realm by taking the shortcut out. Physically, I felt this chalkiness in my mouth, like it was full of chalk and it was difficult to move my tongue. I've felt that before after rapidly returning to my body, but never so strongly as this time.

&amp;#x200B;

For half an hour or so I felt shameful, like I had done a terrible thing that I had to atone for. I told myself that it wasn't my fault; that I didn't understand where I was; that I did what I had to do. The feeling passed, and after a little while I was ok.

Most women, like any other substance user, want to get our bag and carry on with our lives. When you flirt or offer me free lines that jeopardizes your business, because now I know I can't go in and out and I have to either entertain your flirting or find someone new. If I'm looking for a PLUG that means I need the connection so I can get my shit and go on with my business when need be, not do lines with YOU on YOUR time, so thanks but no thanks. That's like if I wanted to buy a rack of beer for a party and the guy behind the counter said I could have one can for free if I drink it with him. That's not what I need. Or imagine if every time you wanted to order food at a restaurant you had to flirt with the waiter or else they might be offended/bored of you and not serve you.

I'm referring to someone you only know as a plug btw, not someone you're interested in or know otherwise. Also being offered free drugs at a party or something is totally a different story from trying to cop and getting hit with the ""You can do lines with me for free whenever you want"".

I was prescribed 5mg Ambien for insomnia and I’ve been taking it as prescribed for the past 12 nights. Most nights I’ve fallen asleep extremely quickly and it’s worked exactly as it needs to. However, there have been three nights or so where I’ve experienced two side effects: uncontrollable shaking and what I believe are hallucinations, but I’m not totally sure.

Basically, I will be lying in bed trying to sleep and my body will start to shake to the point where my teeth are chattering. The hallucinations come alongside the shaking and are basically like extremely, extremely vivid dreams that feel so real. I seriously can’t even describe in words how real they feel; it’s insane. For example, last night after watching the show Money Heist before bed, I hallucinated that I was part of a bank robbery. I don’t feel like I’m in danger from these hallucinations (yet, unsure if they’ll get worse) because I know that I’m hallucinating/dreaming and not to get out of bed. I do worry about my safety in regard to the shaking; it comes up on lists of potential side effects but I can’t find anyone online who has talked about having a similar experience. The only time I see people talking about shaking from Ambien is in regard to withdrawal symptoms which is obviously not the case here.

Prior to last night, if I started to shake/hallucinate after taking the Ambien, it would delay how long it took me to fall asleep (it would take me an hour or two vs falling asleep in like 15 minutes when it works correctly). However, I could still calm the shaking and hallucinations to a point where I could manage to fall asleep. Last night, though, they were so intense that I was pretty much pretty much woken up completely by it by the time the shaking and hallucinations stopped and I didn’t fall asleep until around 7:00am.

The reason I’m posting this is because I can’t tell if I’m hallucinating or just having extremely vivid dreams, and I was hoping someone would have some insight. My reasoning for why I think it’s hallucinations while I’m still conscious is because I’m aware that it’s not real and because I can feel my entire body shaking so intensely while it’s happening. However, I wear an eye mask to sleep so it’s not like I am actually seeing these hallucinations occur in my physical space; it’s all in my brain. I’m not sure if that then counts as a conscious hallucination or if I really am asleep at that time.

Every time it’s like a reoccurring dream that goes deeper every time you have it and the part from before moves along a lot quicker. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t really enjoy getting fucked from weed anymore and it’s kind of annoying. It’s always like a trip and there’s an almost transparent mask of visual shit over my eyes that has patterns and faint colors that reminds me of things from my childhood. (Guess I’m still a child but from younger). It’s almost like a shroom trip where it feels like it’s trying to tell me shit about myself or trying to get me to appreciate when I was little more or something. I don’t really understand it.

I've seen some pretty interesting drug related stories on here and this one definitely fits the bill. 

Let me preface with, my girlfriend and I are still together 4 years later so that's a win. 

Anywho, We go back 4 years. I'm 21, and the weed, liquor, mdma, mushrooms and acid were always around. 

It was a summer of tripping for me and I dosed 1-2 times a week for a few months. I had a lot of fun and made a lot of really lasting friendships that summer.

I also was single and starting to feel kinda lonely during my trips. So what does a 21 year old do? Fires up tinder and tries to meet cute hippie girls. 

That's how I met my SO, she's cute and we hit it off immediately so we go on a few more dates. We had a date planned for Monday night .  Well on Monday morning at like 11am, my roommate returns from summer camp music frestival with all the usual goodies and leftovers. He comes into my room while I'm playing league of legends (I'm VERY concentrated on my game/ headphones on) 

I pulled off one headphone to say what's up and stuff for a minute. He mentions to me that he has some leftover acid in this red-eye relief eye drops bottle. Well in my focus on games, I missed him saying it was like 20ish hits left. 

It's like 12 noon now, and I'm supposed to go on a date at 7pm.

After my game of league, I'm like ooo yeah a hit will be great this afternoon, I'll be done tripping by like 5 perfect. Well I filled up the eye dropper the rest of the way and boofed the whole thing. (Another story for another day as to why I take L like that). 

The trip came on hard as fuck and I was feeling very consumed by my thoughts. I went into the living room and said to my roommate ""wow this L is great man! I feel it and it's been like 15 minutes or less""

He looked at me very seriously and said ""well how much of it did you take?""

I said ""all of it""
And he just burst out laughing and tells me, ""bro that was like 20 hits I told you that!""

Other roommate walks in and goes ""aren't you supposed to go on a date w SO tonight?""

So there I was high as FUCK from a heroic dose of acid, wondering how in the hell I could possibly be sober by 7pm. (Hint: I fucking couldn't!)

I spent the next hour or 2 wondering and talking with my roommates. 

I called SO and was honest. ""I took way more acid than I meant to and now I'm gonna be way too high to go out tonight."" 

She legit died laughing, which honestly saved my trip from being super anxious and terrible. She told me it was cool and we could go out tomorrow or something.

At first it was nice, but I was getting very restless. I cant smoke weed for another 3 months, so I started using other substances. It was a good time at first, until I started using LSD/Mushrooms/Phenibut quite heavily. 

Believe it or not, I didnt notice a huge tolerance increase like others have said. I was taking GG’s, and they are very nice. The problem was more so that I was too used to the high. LSD especially. There were times where I would simply be bored, so Id take a tab or two and play Warzone, Ive won a trios match while peaking before. I get really zoned in. I then began taking phenibut, and it turned into a daily thing. I was also mixing a lot of nitrous oxide with the psychedelics, along with vaping DMT occasionally. I have since vowed to take a nice break from all of those substances. 

One morning around 8AM, I was about 8 hours in and pretty much sober. (This was like a month ago.) I was doing some deep breathing,and just today I believe I didnt take my phenibut like I normally did, and I had a random severe panic attack out of nowhere. I thought I was going to have a seizure/stroke or something. I started losing some feeling/mobility in my wrists/hands, heart was racing, chest hurt a little.. totally thought it was a heart attack or something. Almost called an ambulance, but I didnt want them at my house asking questions. 

I turned out alright. I still have panic attacks to this day. I believe this is overused, but I have a case of HPPD.. especially during the panic attacks, its awful having a panic attack and it starts to look like youre tripping.

The other night I couldnt shake the panic attack. I was trying to cut back on the phenibut, and didn’t realize that cutting back as much as I did would cause problems. I ended up trying to shake it off by walking around my neighborhood for a few hours. Arms/neck hurt, pulse was flying, HPPD was doing its thing. I eventually took more phenibut and was fine like an hour later. I don’t know how I didnt realize it was from the lack of phenibut. Long story short, these substances are beautiful but you must be careful with them. They can cause long lasting issues.

I’ve taken MDMA 4 times over the span of 4 years and psychedelics maybe bimonthly for about 2 years. All in all, thanks to the information i’ve gotten from here, I think I’ve been safe. Last week I had tried to hippie flip with one cap of mdma and 3.5 grams of shrooms. It was great, I had no bad experience, but something strange(?) did happen.

I’d taken the shrooms and one cap of MDMA around 9 pm, and redosed at 3 am with another cap, but had a long workday so I guess my sleepiness overpowered my roll. I fell asleep somewhere between 6-7. I was sleeping next to my boyfriend, and remember being asleep, but i’d wake up every couple minutes and blurt out weird things, like looking at him and calling him my brother’s name, or yelling for my mom and asking where she was. I remember having dreams about the things i’d blurt out and they all felt very realistic, I have just never sleep talked or had dreams that vivid before. Whenever i’d rolled in the past, I would have vivid dreams, but not to this level, or the feeling of really being INSIDE of a dream.

But not too long ago I got heavily addicted Oxycodone and Xanax and went into rehab and have been clean off of benzos and opiates since then. That's not what Im here to talk about.

To start off, I made friends in rehab and became close with them. As time went on we all went our seperate ways. But i kept in contact with literally one person there and we will call him T. I got invited over to T's house and we hung out smoked some weed ate some edibles and had a beer. When i first saw him, mind you its been 6-7 months since I've seen him, he was super skinny, hes back on the meth. We get to chopping it up and we caught up with each other and he asks me if I can help him go pick up. I said yes and help him go pick up.

As we get to the place where he needs to pick up, another one of my friends from rehab was in the same location smoking meth and shooting up heroin again. We'll call him D. I was also really good friends with D up in rehab and we got to be close with each other. D was living a place with two people who have SMI and they also shoot up and smoke meth with him. 

We all catch up with eachother and then T wants to try the meth. So D takes us to his place. As soon as i walked up in there, there was trash EVERYWHERE. There was a brown mattress that used to be white, was on floor surround with food boxes, soda cans, beer and i saw what looked like piss bottles all over the place. It reeked of piss, shit, meth and heroin. 

My friend D just looked miserable. He just looked like he didnt even care anymore about his life. T took a hit and he really liked it so we got his bag and left that place. D dabbed  us up and we left. Later on we find out he shorted T on an 8 ball and now they have beef.

This shit changed my perspective on addicts. I've never seen shit this bad in my entire life. I've been up in dope houses, trap houses, etc. But this one was different. I was actually  seeing my friends suffer in this enviroment and it really fucked me up mentally.

Many things, therapy, probation, MMT have had me pissing in a cup anywhere from thrice weekly to monthly. I firmly believe that a drug test really tests the following: your ability to control your drug use, your ability to know about the drugs you do and their half life/metabolism and last but now least your IQ. Yes to me a drug test is intellectual. Am I smart enough to beat it? I humbly boast a 99% success rate with lab tests. This is what I have done.  *note:* really only applies to urine. Saliva is hit or miss and blood and hair tests are \*extremely\* hard to beat.  


1. **You have rights: use them**. You do have the right to request information surrounding a drug test. What is being tested for and where is it being sent are the 2 big ones. You obviously need to know what they're looking for. I've seen many people have extreme anxiety about for example, benzos showing up when there only taking a NIDA 5 panel drug test (THC, PCP amphetamines, opiates and cocaine).  You always want to know if and where a drug test is being sent. This let's you know first IF it's being sent away and second the reputation of the lab that is being used.  


2. **Dipstick vs lab tests.** These sometimes are one and the same in a sense. Frequently dipstick tests are preliminary. This means that if you can pass them you MAY keep your sample from hitting a lab. Lab test are somewhat more difficult because they check things like creatinine which can show a sample as being dilute. Dilute can mean fail OR a retest.  


3. **Guarantees**. The only surefire way to 100% pass a drug test is not to use drugs in the first place. The only other surefire way to pass is to use someones urine who has not used drugs. And to do that you must do the following:  


4. **Substitution.** I, myself, have been a part of the sub club for about 19 years. Believe it or not I originally used my dogs piss. Yea, I know I have very little,  maybe no shame. This was years ago so I can't speak to whether it will work or not in a lab these days. Now I use human and I recommend you do as well. First things first you gotta find someone who doesn't get high. Good luck with that as that is the hardest thing I have listed here. But once you do find someone make it worth their while. If you live where it's legal buy dehydrated or synthetic urine. Head shops and the internet have them. BUT check you local laws as in quite a few states it's a felony to possess. Once you got clean piss it's time to use it.  


***Sidenote****:* some tests are administered to check if a patient is taking their prescribed meds. These tests are especially tricky to beat. The metabolites of the drugs they are looking for must be present. So finding someone who takes the same meds as you while extremely difficult is not impossible. The other option: freeze your own urine (and I recommend this anyway) with only your prescribed drugs present and nothing else. And no you cannot just add the drug to your clean piss. That isn't how drug tests work.  


5. Now on to **the fun part**. The el switcheroo. The ol' one two piss em up. I recommend if you're looking for jobs or your trying to beat some other test that you freeze your urine IF and WHEN you are clean. This way you have clean piss on hand. I've used piss that was up to 18 months old with no problems (must be frozen and thawed). Or get it from a friend. Now the best way to give a sample is probably a wizzinator. This a phallic object that you strap around your waist and holds the sample at the correct temp and everything. It will have you beating tests. This is especially decent if you're in a situation where someone is watching you piss. The urine (usually) needs to be at the correct temp. Once thawed (I do this overnight) the urine needs to be placed in a bottle. Check for 2 oz nalgene bottles they're the best imo. I use a hand warmer strapped to the bottle for an hour or 2 before hand this usually gets me in the range (90-100 degrees Fahrenheit). I typically strap this to my leg with an ACE bandage as some labs will ask you to empty pockets and purses. Then it's simple clean piss goes into sample cup and given to nurse/doctor whatever. I have never had a cup rejected for temp. Ever. Maybe I'm lucky, maybe its maybelline I dunno.  


6. **Panic mode.** So you didn't follow #5 and now a test is all up on you and you've got 48 hours to piss. This is typical in employment testing. You will be told that you're needed to provide a urine sample and you have 48 hrs to get to a lab and piss. Fear not though. There are things to do. First start drinking water. A good bit. Your gonna want to dilute your urine so its rejected and you have to come in and retest. Or it passed (common in the dipstick world) and you're good. I recommend water, along with Gatorade and some vitamin B12. The B12 will have your urine yellow and the water will dilute it hopefully enough that you pass. I have heard red-bull will do the same. A retest means time (time: it is your friend) to be able to gets drugs out of your system. This is easy for things like blow or opiates which only hang around 5 or so days max. You always demand a retest, some labs consider dilute urine to be a fail but it's always worth asking for a retest. The other thing I recommend is when they ask what meds you take you give them any and all legal drugs you take (think Ibuprofen/tylenol, etc.). It makes it easier to argue a false positive. Personally I think employment drug screening is a violation of privacy since it is always shared around the office and legal RX drugs can sometimes be seen. I really think very few jobs need drug testing.  


7. **Avoid urban myths.** I was always told cranberry juice or a drop of bleach will make you test negative. FALSE. Nothing you put into your body will remove drugs from your system. ""But it worked for me?!"" Well then you got fucking lucky. Likely it was dipstick test and you diluted your urine just enough to get under the cutoff. Or you just fucked up the dipstick themselves. Either way I vehemently oppose anyone who thinks this shit actually is a good thing to bank on. The only foolproof way to not have drugs in your piss is not to take drugs. Substitution when done well is the next best thing. I tell people to avoid detox drinks as 1. they sometimes contain alcohol and alcohol is on SOME tests and 2. they aren't a surefire thing.  


So there it is 7 things that have let me beat a fucking ton of drug tests. I know it's a strange thing to be proud of but hell I'm pretty proud of myself. Most times I get a bit of a rush out of beating em. Ironic that drug testing actually gives me a pseudo high. So if anyone has any questions about drug tests let me know, I love making sure peoples freedoms to use a substance safely aren't infringed upon.

 Felt fine. After a cple hours of my buddy texted for me to watch the UFC. Was going great. Before I left for his place I go home, was near sober and no awkward ""im so fucking high lets talk about gibberish till the birds chirp."" After got home I was on a mild mix of alcohol and stim,which I think is keeoing me from heading straght to bed. 

Went over to his for a good cple hours befefore callingit a night bout 230-3 am. Got a safe drive home from sober ride share.

now I think this is where the fuck up comes in. I have an un opened bag of 250mg etizlam power. I have a scale but with slightly shsky hands there is no way was gonna try and single out a 1mg dose to inuce sleep. Against all recommendations I choose to dip a dry toothpick into the powder. It looked like a patheticly small amount. Did one or two of those and went to bed. 

While aparntly I never made it to bed. woke up on the floor in my video game room. At that point i'm just assuming it is the day after saturday. Tried to get up, lost my balance and fell into the corner of the room. go up stairs to my room, do an inventory check for beonings, found everything I left with yesterday( Wallet, keys and my weed

. Was hard to walk, looked like a blind criple moving from object to object that would hold my weight. Made it to my room where I lost blance again and crashed over into a shelf I built, obliterating the thing.

worst part of all of this, I entirely slept through sunday and it was now Monday morning. wtf? I guess the toothpick in the pwder holds a lil more weight than what the naked eye can precieve. 

First time loosing track of a day..kinda scary, but at the same time relieving because as of right now it doesnt appear i've cause any physical ot emotional trauma to me or family. As all I did was sleep, never got up for anything

First of all I never would of thought that post would of blown up that much and I'm so grateful for all the upvotes. I'm really sorry if I didnt fully explain myself and my writing was kinda frantic. I didnt have my add medication till that night so I wrote that when my mind was going speed racer. I've been looking over the comments. Especially ones about how alot of said u sounded like me when u were my age. And how addiction still caught up. And I've really been thinking about it for hours now. And I've come to the conclusion I'm gonna stop my expirementation with drugs for a bit. I have a more important thing I wanna put most of my effort into and that's music. I was looking back at my page and seeing patterns on how the times I experimented with drugs. Yah it was fun trying new drugs or trying a new drug I just got for a little bit. But all those times I take those drugs I'm taking away from time I could use towards my music (I've promised myself not to do drugs while making music other than weed since I dont wanna use drugs like addis or acid as a crutch for music writing). 


    
      Thank u all for all your comments. Especially the people really just telling me how it be from there perspective. I dont wanna end up a drug addict like my mom was once( she has been clean though for a long time since after are birth. She is the best mom in the world and her addiction doesn't make me feel any less of her as mom. I just wanted to point that out) or end up like my real dad dead in a heroin den. Or my stepdad who quit smoking weed to get a bette job just to shove in are faces it's so easy to quit. Then precedes to start smoking anyways( and lemme say heavier than me. And he was in a 1 year tolerance break and I've been smoking 2 years straight) and snorting coke. I'm not saying that I dont want to stop experimenting forever. But more I've realized this just isnt the time anymore. 



     

     I'm 19. I wanna get out there and make music and hopefully change people's lives for the better like my favorite musician have for me. And I can't do that if I'm stuck in addiction or dead.... I'm still gonna smoke weed cause it's my medicine for all my ailments and I'm not getting on addis for my add or i dont even know what they give out for ibs pain if they even do. And I'm still everyone once in a gonna take some acid or shrooms cause they really help me see the beauty in life agian and has helped me a tremendous amount thru this quarantine. So thanks. Everyone. I'm telling all my friends as we speak that if I offer we like party or do something that is new or not something like acid or shrooms to cut me off. Idk...

We didn’t know this at the time but he started believing that tripping and smoking allowed him to talk to his ancestors and other spirits. He started getting obsessive with smoking, selling all his possessions for weed (were talking a middle class kid in a suburban area not the city or anything).

Anyways I’m not sure how he came to this conclusion, but eventually he decided he wanted to die.  So what did he do to try and kill himself? He walked over to our local police station and brandished a realistic gun to a cop that was leaving.  It was all caught on surveillance cameras.  The cop shot him literally 5  times in non lethal areas (luckily, he could have aimed for the head or chest) and an ambulance was called.  Luckily he survived this police encounter.  Afterwards he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and sent to a mental hospital for a year or so before being released to home confinement. His parents may not of even known but he tried very hard after he got home to start smoking ant tripping again, although even his old friends were hesitant to provide him with stuff because of what happened.  This is basically the end of the story my friends don’t talk to him much anymore so I don’t even know if he has stayed clean or if he’s off home confinement yet.

She has planned to do it with a friend at her home (so safe environnement).

One thing to know about her is that she had a very complicated childhood and suffers from something like depression. She is fine and a very happy girl most of the times but something very little can be the end of the world for her or sometimes it is very ""loud""? in her head and its difficult for her to calm down. But thats another topic. I just wanted to say that mentally she isn't too healthy even though it is getting better.

I have a bit of a problem because I'm **too** sensitive in general and little things about her affect me a lot. When she told me that she will try those drugs my stomach dropped and I literally wanted to vomit. Now one day later I still feel quite stressed and tremble a bit writing this. I don't know exactly why my body reacted like this but I think that I'm scared.

Anyways I already used weed many times and she too and that doesn't bother me since I know that it is not very harmful. But with these drugs I know nothing only that my parents multiple times told me stories about friends of them where their child took and never got back to normal and had severe damages even after even the first try ect.

I read a lot online about them too and theses articles really show serious side effects which doesn't help me at all. I have the feeling though that they turn it into worse than it actually is. She will be in a safe environnement, with a good friend and her friend will try the pills first with someone else so the chances that it is a bad mix is limited.

I tend to not be very rational on things that affect me so much emotionally. I think its bad to read more articles that make me even more scared. I guess that I just need real humans that tell me that the situation is not that bad and that most probably nothing will happen to her. And most importantly *why* I shouldn't worry because I need to unterstand things. Or which drugs is the least dangerous of them? She wanted that I try too but I have so much planned in my life and am afraid that it will make irreversible damages on me so I don't feel comfortable at all...

Marijuana is still illegal here, but plenty of people smoke it. The problem is its the same shit, no matter which side of town I go to, who or where I get it from, its always the same. There is no variety of weed here in New Zealand. Its all a skunk sativa based strain. 

I started smoking it when I was 14. I got super fucked up every time I smoked, sometimes I felt disorientated but I mostly enjoyed it. After about 3 months of smoking it, I smoked too much once time and got super paranoid. I was shaking and freaking out for no reason, my mates I was with convinced me that going for a walk would be a good idea (terrible fucking idea). I ended up puking my guts out in the middle of the road, it was so bad I was vomiting up food I ate 8 hours prior.

After that I smoked weed about 3 times, being extremely careful with how much I was smoking, but even one bong was now making me extremely paranoid. I gave up completely and the next time I smoked weed was when I was 16. Although I only did it about 6 times and I smoked a very little amount. When I was 17, I went with my stoner friend to his stoner friends house. They were all smoking bongs so I had one. It got me super fucked up and I ended up on the grass outside, luckily it was a warm day, but I felt extremely uncomfortable and paranoid and was concentrating on not vomiting, which fournately I did not do.

I started smoking weed again last year (19 then). I was smoking it on my own after I got home from work, which I enjoy more, as I'm more likely to get paranoid if I'm out. Also I had a busy job, so it was a very relaxing end to the day. Unfortunately a few weeks ago, I smoked a bong which I packed to the max and it happened again. I started feeling very uncomfortable and paranoid for no reason, I ended up in the bathroom and vomited the lovely dinner and a beer I'd just had. I was uncomfortable for about an hour, but then I had an amazing time for about 2 hours listening to music, so it was just some sort of come up nausea. I had had four coffees that day, so I contribute the caffeine to making me paranoid and sick.

Unfournately I can't smoke weed anymore. I tried smoking a pipe, but I felt feelings of paranoia and nausea coming on again. I hadn't had any caffeine that day either.

Now onto caffeine. I was a sugar addict when I was 14 and would often steal or buy (when I got money) energy drinks. They started making me crook so I quit and didn't have any caffeine at all until I was 18, when I started work and started drinking coffee. I'd have coffee on and off, but would try to stick to only having one on Friday. The day after having a coffee I'd always feel extremely exhausted, it was often a Saturday so I'd just push through it, usually I would pass out on the couch around 3-4pm due to caffeine withdrawals.

There were a few periods where I'd have a coffee everyday for about a week - two weeks and then I'd decide to quit. Usually I'd quit for a week and then I'd be tired for some reason and be straight back to the coffee. Caffeine just doesn't effect me well. One cup of coffee keeps be wired for about 12 hours and I always feel like shit the next day. After about 18 months of consuming coffee on and off, it started making me feel extremely nauseous. Paranoia wasn't really a thing, but the nausea was embarrassing as I'd be fighting the urge to vomit in awkward situations at times. Anyway, since convid 19 I've lost my job, so I've been able to take time to myself and quit caffeine.

Now the other drug I've tried is LSD. I've had two trips of dark Web acid at 150ug. I vomited on the come up of the first trip. Fasted the 2nd trip as I heard that prevents nausea, which luckily worked. Both trips I had feelings of paranoia, I wouldn't say I had bad trips, as I enjoyed most of it, but if I'd taking say 200ug I could have had a bad trip.

I've also had LSD multiply times at lower doses. 25ug and 50ug where common. I had 75ug once. 25ug I use to take before school and 50ug would be if I was going out or hanging with mates in the weekend. Note I wasn't smoking weed during the times I was doing LSD. 25 and 50 both caused nausea at times, usually just for an hour, but I never vomited. Even one time last year, I'd had a shit ton of coffee and 50ug and I had a good time. If I decided to do that this weekend I'd probably get paranoid and nauseous, seeing as coffee as just recently started effecting me badly.

I also went for a drive around the hills as a passenger and needed to get out and vomited, because I'd had two coffees and a red bull that day, I was so fucking nauseous and I usually don't get car sick.

Why can't I just enjoy some drugs? Weed makes me paranoid and nauseous, caffeine makes me feel sick as fuck and I wouldn't have more then 150ug of LSD as I'd probably have a bad trip. The only drug I can enjoy is alcohol. I really would like to be able to smoke weed, because I do see benefits when I smoke it, the paranoia is just making it impossible to enjoy.

I would also like to experiment with some drugs. I have good discipline, so addiction isn't an issue, although I wouldn't try anything that's poison. Any suggestions on anything that I might enjoy?

As I sit her withdrawing off GHB, I'm looking back at the relationship I've had with this drug and how much it has taken from me.

It was my decision to try it and it was ultimately my decision to start using it every day so no-one to blame but myself. Anyone who knows about GHB knows how notorious and dangerous it is.

I've lost everything. My health, my relationships, my mind, you name it. I'm certain to lose my job andy house too. I've been in two car wrecks in the space of a month and should be dead. I feel extremely ill and don't even know if I'm gonna live through this because of the damage it has done or because I don't trust myself not to want to put and end to this misery. GHB lowers your inhibitions so I've done insane things and I've tried every other drug under the sun now. I've been in and out of hospitals and A+E more times than I can tell you from collapsing in a heap in work and other places. I'm in trouble with the law and have to sort that out. The past year has been pretty much a blur and I'm disgusted with myself looking back at it.

I can't even begin to describe the withdrawal. It's absolutely cruel and pretty much like being tortured 24/7.  You can forget about sleeping. You are practically disabled and incapacitated. There's no way you can leave the room never mind the house. Twitching, jerking and tremors incessantly. You feel like you're going insane. Everything is amplified and you're in full on panic mode every second of the day. I'm fighting with every ounce of my strength to get through this. Trying to be very strategic with my use of other drugs to make it a little easier. I've used one single benzo last night to get the first sleep I've had in a few nights. I'm taking as little baclofen as I can and I used phenibut once. I'm a total mess and unable to feed myself or do anything for myself.

This lovely girl I started seeing has been researching it for a while and on our first date said, ""I wanna do mushrooms with you."" She's never tripped at all.
""Well actually.... Now that you mention it. I might..."" Then slyly pulled the large clear freezer bag of fungi.

Sunday rolls around and we decide to spend the morning at the lake. We both felt very comfortable and carefully ate a few caps, her taking about half of what I did, and waited for at least an hour. Nothing happens, we eat more... Start having some beer and swimming near the shore. 2 hours later. Nothing. We run out of beer. I am able to make it to the beer store when things turn a bit shroomy.
 The almost dark miasma that seems to wisp about was prevalent. Then the massive weight of time slowing down...I knew  it's setting it.
We still feel great, and make it back to the lake safely. 

We swim and start to feel them set in. Great beautiful day. Laughter. She says she'll be right back, to go pee (probably puke).

She left for a long time, I don't know how long, but I started looking for her quickly. I walked the different paths to the car, probably about 2 square acres of woods. No where to be found! Im calling her name loudly as I run back to the shore to get my keys, then run back to my car to get my phone (all while coming up on some creeper shrooms, oh and its like 95°F and East Texas humid).

I have one message from her saying her mom had found her at the lake, she knew we'd be there and was franctically searching for her. Her SISTER from Virginia had just been in a car wreck, and her and her mom were flying out immediately to be with her. That's the last thing I heard from her.
I hope her sister's ok. I hope she is too...

* Start: **1.65 g Maeng Da Enhanced (=laced with extract)**

* 2.5h: Disappointed; not much but mild stomach pain and nausea, which lasts for hours. **+1.5 g bali red** (high sedation, low euphoria)
* 3h: bali red is indeed great for sedation - might be a good candidate for replacing my benzos, which is why I got it! But disappointed, since I wanted an ""opioid"" day.
* 4.5h: Very disappointed now. **+1.5 g Sumatra Green**
* 5h: Decent ""compromise"" of euphoria &amp; sedation.
* Really awesome chilling in bed with soft music. But throughout the whole night, I get so ""euphoric"" that I jump up and do stuff, which stops the feeling.
* 10h: Take painkiller (Ibuprofen) early on to avoid hangover - success! Having a good day.

(Just rambling from here on)

Ok, I'm a little more experienced now and certain that my general opioid tolerance transfers to Kratom. So next time, I can take the full dose right from the start. 3rd time's the charm! Good to know that Bali Red does work as a benzo replacement as intended! Both times, good stuff started happening when Maeng Da Enhanced and Sumatra Green came together - coincidence?

Still appreciate tips how I can enjoy the euphoria &amp; keep chilling in bed without getting overexcited &amp; jump up :-)

A while ago, I posted in this [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ahyzet/research_on_psychedelics_awe_experiences_and/) asking if people wanted to participate in our research on psychedelic experiences.

We have now published a peer-reviewed article about this research in Psychopharmacology, a well-ranked academic journal, and I would like to share it with you:  [https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s00213-020-05568-y](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s00213-020-05568-y)

In short, what we found was that feelings of connectedness and vastness during significant  serotonergic psychedelic trips of the past five years are associated with current feelings of empathy and connectedness, and lower levels of exploitative-entitled narcissism.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Long version:

We hypothesised that for people who experienced awe and ego dissolution during significant serotonergic psychedelic experiences, this would have long lasting effects. In particular, that this would be associated with currently increased feelings of connectedness and affective empathic drive. This in turn would be associated with lower maladaptive narcissism specifically, such as entitlement and exploitativeness, since this type drives the negative relationship between empathy and trait narcissism (Hepper et al., 2014). We [pre-registered](https://osf.io/nmh74/) these hypotheses.

We concluded our data collection (N=414), and analysed our data. Our hypotheses were mostly borne out: Of those who had a significant psychedelic experience in the past 5 years, those scoring high on having experienced awe (in particular feelings of vastness and connectedness) during their trip, had corresponding higher levels of feelings of connectedness and empathy (in particular affective empathetic drive) \*now\*. Surprisingly (and counter our predictions), experiences of ego dissolution during trips did not have this effect.

Current greater feelings of connectedness and empathy in turn predicted lower scores on exploitative-entitled narcissism. (Note that empathy here=affective empathic drive, the vicarious experience of emotion, as opposed to cognitive empathy, which is perspective taking. Note also the difference between drive (=willingness) and ability)

We conclude that serotonergic psychedelic drugs may have clinical use for personality disorders, but that future research is needed to follow-up on this cross-sectional online survey.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,684646,public,confidence,self,Experiencing significant psychedelics trips is associated with higher empathy and lower narcissism years later,0,[],0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gywbn5/experiencing_significant_psychedelics_trips_is/,no_ads,0.0,1591638176.0,Psychedelics,450b9864-9d47-11e5-bb1d-0ef44579b8c1,Psychedelics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I tried literally everything at that age except for meth and heroin (bath salts, crack etc.. hard ass shit like that). 

On one occasion I was given a HUGE amount of Adderall for completely free. I went to sell some 15 year old some weed and he didn’t have any other container than the bottle which contained his prescribed adderall. He just empties out the whole thing, gives me all the pills, and puts the weed in. I didn’t charge him for the bud, obvs.

FFW to about a month later, it’s just before Christmas and my fam is out of town so I have the house to myself. I invited over a few friends and my girlfriend to party it up.

My girlfriend had never done adderall before so she only took 15 milligrams. My best friend at the time and I took around 90 mg each, but at some point we just stopped counting the pills. This same friend cut his hand somehow when attempting to shotgun a beer (yes I know, very stupid to mix these but I was naive). I told him to get a bandaid from the bathroom, and this mf isn’t in there 30 seconds before he’s yelling “OP, OP you gotta see this shit get in here!”

I went to investigate why he was calling me to the bathroom, and this motherfucker has the biggest smile on his face and his hands behind his back. I ask what he found, and he reveals to me an unopened 2-year-old bottle of prometh with codeine. Jackpot.

I had no idea what codeine would do to a person, and had never ingested it before. Between the 4 of us there, we drank the entire bottle. We were all just chilling in the living room when I realized I was beginning to hallucinate. I’d hear footsteps on the floor behind me, turn around to nobody there. At one point I was staring the base of a candle mantle (one that raises the candle off of the table about 4 inches) and realized there were spiders. Everywhere. They were climbing the base up to the top of the candle, and falling back down. I’d look away, and they’d disappear in my peripheral vision, but when looking directly at it, they’d reappear. Even with all this, it was still a great experience and I enjoyed it very much.

I had hallucinations like this when I did DPH, but never did I expect this to happen on codeine and adderall, then again, I did little to no research back then.

Just wanted to share my story 🤙🏼

I didnt have any good friends at that time so I thought ""why not, let's see how it is"" so I met with them every week.

One day someone offered me some weed, but it wasn't the good stuff. Not that I had a bad trip, but no matter how much I smoked, I just didnt feel anything. So I asked them if they had something else, they did. It was speed. And I liked it. I did it maybe once or twice a month, but stopped taking it after a few months. There was also a lot of problems which I didnt realize in the beginning. People beating each other up, rapists thinking they can just chill there with us and getting almost killed, an alcoholic gay nazi priest (who I am actually still friends with cause he's funny as hell)and like 13 year olds wanting to kill themselves. But the only important one to this story is some guy from a big gang (let's call him Ted) who wanted to hire me as his dealer. 

Time passed and I found new friends who didnt do drugs. I was clean, didnt even smoke cigarettes anymore, for 1 year. Then I met my current bf, who had a friend who knew some people that I knew from under the bridge. Sometimes we went to a pavillon in a park where we would smoke some weed and just have fun. After some time people invited people and it turned ugly really quick again. 

Around that time I had some money problems, so I asked Ted if he had some things to sell. So he gave me some ecstasy, weed and speed that I could sell. It went away pretty quickly. But I did the mistake of trying his ecstasy. I had never been that happy in my life.

I did it maybe once or twice a month, but after some time I used it more regularly. At one time even every second day. About 9 months ago I went over to another friends place. He was a heavy user, so I could trip as much as I wanted. I had my best trips at his place, including hallucinations, complete trance or just laughing 8 hours straight. It was so much fun.

But now I can't stop. I'm not really addicted to any drug in particular, just to being high. Not being myself anymore. I love the feeling of being happy, or laughing for no reason at all. Right now I'm  getting stoned every evening. Even if I promise myself to take a break I'm just like ""nah, that can wait"" even if I have shit for work to do.

I'm just not strong enough to do anything. When I lay in bed I think to myself ""shit, I need to do that"", but I just watch youtube instead. I know that I need to change my life, but I dont want to. I just want to have fun.

I know that if I quit I won't be happy anymore, and I'm scared I could turn suicidal again.

I’m turning 21 in just a few weeks. In the country I live in, drinking isn’t legal until you’re 21, but that has never stopped me. 

I grew up in a household with heavy drinkers. My father worked everyday for 12+ hours and came home every night and would drink really hard. There was a lot of times he was physically and mentally abusive towards me. I don’t want to get into specifics, but I was hit before and I grew up with a lot of mental abuse. 

My mom was a stereotypical housewife. She stayed home and sipped on wine every night and eventually was diagnosed with schizophrenia which helps explain some of her abuse. 

But anyways, I first got into drinking when I was 15 years old. As soon as I first experienced it, I loved it. I started stealing beers from my parents when they wouldn’t notice and slowly declined into harder alcohol. 

There was a point where I felt like I couldn’t leave the house and have regular social interactions without drinking. I would chug a small bottle of vodka mixed with water every time I had to talk to interact with other people. It just made me feel good. 

Well I don’t need to write a sob story. But it hasn’t gotten better. I’m 20 years old. I drink every night. And when I don’t, I fiend and search the house for more booze. I’m really just waiting until I turn 21 and I can buy my own bottles and go out in peace. 

It would be nice to buy an expensive bottle of scotch and go out to the farmlands by my house and finish up what I’ve started. But until then, I just have to keep living this life. Which is that of a sad, alcohol addicted, worthless man.

Opioid related problems
- Problems: Social media, CDC

Goal: With information aboout drugs, drug supliers, family problems -> construct knowledge graph.

- 3 Kinds of data we would like to intregate. I believe this was Reddit, News, and online data about drugs like CDC etc.
- Expect to conduct knowledge graphs
- The nodes will be the drugs, kinds of drugs, treatments. (as examples)

Example:
Arrest is an event, asociated with location, with kind of drug. 
What we are expecting to see: Timeview of the events. 
Say windows of 1 week, we may see different relationships.

- Suplementary data, lists of drgus.
- Check calissifiction of drugs, (CDC) maybe.


1) Go to reddit get an API. Search for r/drugs captura posts. Maybe capture 2 months of data. Break into weeks of data.
2) Once we choose the 8 weeks the professor will supply us with the news articles. Profssor will supply the lists and 2 news sets.
3) To show that the knoewledge graph is useful we would do some queries.
4) Do some graph analysis

Check out:
Network X python library. This can convert pandas df to graph.

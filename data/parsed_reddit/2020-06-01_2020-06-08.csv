I have massive fields of Papaverum Rhoeas near me. They grow like weeds, they're almost everywhere and look amazing. I decided to try them out. The literature is very slim on these, however folk medicine recommend them for sleep, so it's not a novel thing. The only comprehensive human study found was this: [https://www.hindawi.com/journals/crim/2015/321360/](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/crim/2015/321360/)

So what I did is I took **10 small pods** , the seeds were white, so not ripe yet, (\~80-90 grams), put them in a blender, then put them in boiling water and let it boil for 1 minute, let it cool down for 10 minutes and strain. Pretty simple. Tasted like green shit. 

I drank 1/3 (harm reduction purposes) and waited with a little bit of anxiety. I must say it hit in 20 minutes and the hit was different yet had similarities with Opium. You definitely recognise it as an opiate high, however, the first time I tried I felt a little bit anxious, dysphoria and a little nausea was there but I definitely felt sedated.

I drank another 1/3 of the brew and the second time things were much more pleasant, my anxiety was lower since I knew what I was dealing with and I could really enjoy it. 

As a bottom line, they do have sedative effects and are good for sleep, but no euphoria and state of mind is only slightly altered, I think they would be an equivalent of a good OTC sleep helper (mixture of valerian/passion flower/etc). 

Would definitely try again, as I'm curious to explore it further. I've seen some interesting topics here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/4py8i3/how\_to\_make\_opium\_from\_a\_papaver\_rhoeas\_or\_common/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/4py8i3/how_to_make_opium_from_a_papaver_rhoeas_or_common/) 

And this guy he made hash out of the pods and smoked it via water bong. Quite interesting. And yes, this works, it's not a placebo. Use it with care as there are no clinical studies of what impact it has on our organs.

I've been on house arrest for the past 3 months bc I was the driver in a series of armed robberies. we mugged people on the street and put a pellet gun that looks like a glock to people's heads. I hate that I got involved and I hated every second of it. I told myself it was for free money and weed but I think I did it to prove to myself that I'm capable of something like that. I've since learned it doesn't matter and I don't want to be capable of that. I hated every second of it and I hate that I went back the second day. 
I've been 3 months sober from weed but I have been hitting my suorin throughout. I had previously quit but had my friend get me one just bc I felt like I needed something. I took mushrooms once maybe 2 months ago, more to see if there's something I'm missing than to get fucked up. 
I've been depressed before, but not like this. never like this. going to work helps, talking to people helps. but I feel like a ghost. I feel dead all the time. my family will call me out to dinner and I walk out feeling just empty. I've never seriously considered suicide before, I know that's not a good option, I'm not ready to go and it wouldn't really solve anything. there should be light at the end of the tunnel but it's looking farther and farther away. I haven't gotten my actual sentence yet and I was hoping when I did it would be a smaller number than what I've already served but I got my court date this week for next month and was feeling alright maybe this can be over soon but my lawyer said they're just going to push it back again. I'm an honest to God good person and I don't know how or why I got involved in this. I used to go to church every week, got straight A's and was overall nice and good I swear. my friend talked me into it and after a little convincing I said fuck it. biggest mistake of my life. I never got out of the car so I really didn't do much other than drive but obv I was still involved. what pisses me off is I'm one of two that got arrested when there were five of us involved and yet I'm the one catching shit from all of them. when I got arrested I told the cops everything they already knew, bc they had us on camera. I didn't give away my friends names or anything like that. and yet I almost got jumped, people message me calling me snitch, and the other kid that got arrested said it's on sight. I don't really care about any of that idk if they'll ever find me but what worries me a little is this kid has a lot of friends that are hot about it. he's not gang affiliated but he damn near is w all his connections and shit. I know if anyone recognizes me in public once I'm free, somethings gonna happen. I can handle one person, but two, three, six? when they possibly have weapons? it's toast wtf can I do
idk that's not why I'm making this post tho. I'm less worried about all that than about my general fucking well being. I feel dead and the way I see it I have 3 options. I can ride this out, which is probably what's gonna happen, I can kill myself, which I won't do but who knows where I'll be in a month it's only gotten worse and worse so far, or I can cut this thing off and run away. I almost wanna do that but I know it probably won't go over well. I'll probably get caught, get more time, and it won't be worth it. even if I did get away, then what? I can't live in hiding forever and I don't imagine I can just go back home later on. if my plates ever got ran I'd immediately be taken back into custody. but honestly, what if I did? I'd probably get in my car then start driving down my hill and cut it right before I exit my lane so I could have a little head start, as I know they'd get alerted right away. they wouldn't know which way I went or where I'm going and I know a girl I could stay with that no one I know even knows about but then what? it's a bad idea I know, but what if man?

Open my bag looking for my headphones, and ive found a bottle of vodka and a 4 pack of redbull. Decided to down that as well, why not?

Hour later, mates calling me into the room. I can have a lil bit of coke, not a line but a hit. I go for it, and I'm feeling great. Talking to a guy, and guess what, hes got caps.

I spent the entire uber trip pretty much paralysed. I just couldn't think. I woke up the next day, no comedown, but on the way to my relatives place, i feel chest pain. Am I about to have a heart attack? I don't know. I'm not driving but what if my parents don't notice? I manage to survive, wake up today and the pain is still there.

In no particular order:

5: Synthetic canabiods
AKA: Spice, mamba, black mamba, legal high, K2, Zombie, zombie meth

Currently popular in the U.K- a synthetic canaboid nicknamed “spice” causes withdrawals worse than herion and was legal in all it’s forms up until 2016. It causes vomiting, seizures and terrifying hallucinations. Synthetic canabiods are a group of drugs invented accidentally in 2006 by a chemist and have since been deemed “unsafe for human consumption”

4: Desomophine

AKA: krokodil, croc, dihydrodesoxymorphine
A semi-synthetic opioid used as a sedative in the 40s and is 8-10 times stronger than the highly addictive painkiller morphine. It was popularised recreationally in russia in the 2010’s and can easily be made with over the counter pharmaceuticals and red phosphorus. This drug also contains battery acid and paint thinners. Oh and if your not put off already, it melts your skin and has a chance of giving you HIV

3. Glue huffing
AKA: glue sniffing, huffing

Pretty self explanatory: not got much to say other than my dad’s school mate murdered a priest when high on glue- truly diabolical 

2. Flaka
AKA: the zombie drug, Alpha-Pyrrolidinopentiophenone

Flakka is a dangerous drug that has many bad side effects, mostly including changes in behavior or mood. Even slight overdoses of Flakka can cause. elevated heart rate, extreme agitation, jerking muscle movements, delirious thoughts, hyperstimulation, hallucinations, and; often profound paranoia. Once a man high on flakka ate a homeless mans face off

1. scopolamine 
AKA: Devils breath
This drug is popular in columbia and causes instantaneous loss of control and anyone can be forced to do anything because the cannot resist agains it.

A few days ago I went out at night with a group of friends to a local park. I had ~2g of weed on me and a buddy had ~4g, both of us also had grinders, rolling papers, etc.. The park we were at is not necessarily a hot spot for drugs but it's kinda known that it does see it's fair share of them, ranging from weed to (rarely) MDMA, but nothing harder than that. 

We had passed around something like 3-5 joints around, everyone's stoned or drunk, listening to some music and joking around when we see a cop car make the turn to our location. My buddy, being way more experienced than me, throws his grinder, papers and stash into the trees when the cop car was passing behind a small blindspot, while I, stoned and half-paralyzed by fear, freeze and just keep my stuff in my jacket's inner pocket. We kill the music and wait. 

We're sitting on a picnic table and I have my back turned to the parking lot, and I can hear the cop car pulling into it, headlights straight on my back, the car turning off, doors opening and closing, and their footsteps on the grass getting closer. I had never encountered the police directly before, apart from at drunk driving check points (I don't drink).

They approach us and I'm sitting right next to the end of the table bench which meant they were standing inches away from me, while my buddy was on the other end. They then started talking to us in what seemed like a good-cop-bad-cop routine to me. 

Conversation goes something like ""Good night, young men and women"", ""Good night"", ""Having a pleasant night?"" to which my stoned ass replies ""Kinda cold but yes"" with no idea about how my eyes looked and if they could tell or not by looking at them. 

""Are you all from around here?"", which we were and said so, and then the bad cop asks about public gatherings, which at the moment, in my country, are limited to 10 people max because of the Covid-19 pandemic (we were 11 but honestly didn't even notice we were over the limit until they brought it up). One of my friends jokingly tells another one to go home so we would only be 10 and a muffled laughter ran through us and into the good cop. 

At this point there was a moment of silence, and it was just 2 cops looking straight at us and me just begging internally for everyone to be looking sober enough and knowing they would DEFINITELY feel my stuff in my jacket's pocket if they chose to pat me down. Still, I keep a regular look. 

The good cop then turns to the bad cop and says ""All clear?"" to which he says ""All clear."". They both say ""Good night"" to us, to which we reply the same, and as they're taking their leave the good cop says ""Don't do drugs. It's bad for you."" in a jokingly way. They get in the car and drive off. 

All my friends wait until the car disappears and just start talking and laughing their asses off about the whole thing, getting incredibly calm about it incredibly fast. I couldn't ease my mind for the rest of the night, though. We still smoked 2-3 more joints (I would take 2 puffs and pass them immediately) and then everyone went home. 

It's been 3 days now and I still can't help but getting a small freak-out jumpscare everytime the corner of my eye catches a car passing near me, even if it's not a police one. I can't shake off the thoughts of ""They parked next to our cars. They noted down my license plate and remember my car's appearance. They always know where I am because of that. They remember my face. They're keeping an eye on me now. I'm a suspect. They're watching me."". Cigarettes have been my only way of calming down and getting on with my days. 

My town has what's considered the average number of drug users without any serious cases, and when police do find someone smoking joints the usual approach is to simply tell them to put it out and throw it in the trash, or even stand next to them and saying they're gonna wait until the person finishes it to guarantee they don't hand it to anyone else (which could already be considered trafficking), and then confiscating the rest of their stash if they have any. 

I'm a 25 year-old university student, living in Portugal with a spotless record, apart from a 30€ parking ticket. Light drug possession has be de-criminalized in my country, however not de-penalized. 
I'm a semi-regular cannabis user and this was one of the very rare occasions that I did actually have weed on my possession. 
I didn't get searched, nor was I their ""focus"" throughout the whole conversation, and since no one was actively smoking anything they didn't take it too serious. 

Yet, I've been stuck at paranoia's realm gates ever since that night even though I have apparently no reason to worry and all my friends have pretty much forgotten about it already. 
My family is pretty easy-going but still not easy-going enough to not be hugely let down/pissed off if they found out I've already went further than just ""trying the funny cigars once"".
I had been planning to try LSD for the first time in the upcoming week but now I'm dead-scared of it because I'm almost sure I'll have a bad trip over this episode. 


TL; DR: police approached me and my friends while we had weed on us, nothing really serious happened and no records were taken, but I have been close to paranoid about it ever since.

-such compound would produce visuals, but not the mindset that’s telling you what to believe and what not to believe, therefore, you would perceive those visuals as the reality and you wouldn’t be able to tell apart the real reality and visuals-reality mix. And that sounds like a deliriant to me.

So some background info, I'm 19, male and extremely neurotic. I have opened up businesses, spent a bunch of money on them and then closed them in a week because I got bored of it. Yeah, it's bad. I also have severe OCD and PTSD, and get horrible intrusive thoughts constantly. I also have physical tics that destroy my body because of how raw I make it from repetitive movements I can't control. These tics have almost gotten me into a car accident before. And lastly I also have extremely unstable moods, I'll go from peak ego to severely depressed within 15 minutes. These mental health issues make my life unbearable normally. I don't know the exact terms, I'm not a mental health professional obviously but I believe this personality cluster is a pretty common one hence why I wanted to make this post. See I spent 19 years of my life going unmedicated as I was stupid and thought that ***medication was for weak people.*** On a daily basis I am so neurotic, uncontrolled and frankly psychotic that I just want to die. However, this all changed a few days ago. 

2 weeks ago I went to a doctor for the first time in my life to describe my mental health issues. I was first prescribed Adderall XR and it was fucking awful. I was even more neurotic and crazy however this time I was 10 times more amped up and couldn't sleep. So, after weaning off of it my doctor then convinced me to try 50 Mg of Zoloft. And oh my god I couldn't be happier with it. No anxiety, literally none. Normally there's a million thoughts flowing through my head every second however with this medication, I focus on one singular thing at a time. No more random spells of aggression and mood swings that make me go from on top of the world to wanting to die every 15 minutes. It's incredible. Even when faced with daunting/unfun tasks I still get them out of the way without feeling bad about it. 

This medication is INCREDIBLE. And while I know everybody reacts differently to it, I know my mental health conditions are so common that if you haven't tried this I can't help but recommend it. It's also very cheap, for 40 bucks a month I get to feel relief from mental hell. Oh yeah and I should also mention that weed isn't a good way to cope with these disorders if you relate to me and happen to self medicate that way. It only makes you feel good for a few hours and then it's straight back to hell. I should also mention that normally I am ADDICTED to weed and smoke it all day and night and eat a lot of edibles. Though on this medication? I haven't even had the urge to smoke once. 

I WILL SAY THERE are some cons with this medication:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The first 2 days you take it you'll be met with adjustment symptoms, like diarrhea, motion sickness, drowsiness. But I heavily recommend sticking it out because if you do there's a massive light at the end of hte tunnel.
2. I wouldn't recommend smoking weed or drinking alcohol on it. You can do whatever you want obviously but I tried smoking one day and drinking the next and I was really sick feeling and had to lay down. 
3.

Generally ive been very reckless taking cid and I know it but this has by far been the dumbest thing ive done with cid.

(Im not going to use real names for obvious reasons)

Pre-Game

So its the weekend and my friends pick me up to go smoke since my friend, lets call him Fred bought some wax. I was also with my friends Johnny, David and Ashley (David and Ashley are a couple) so we go to Davids house and start smoking some wax. Fred had extra money so he suggested we by some acid. We said fuck it and I texted some plugs and finally had one who could serve us. My friend wanted to buy a ten strip so we could all at least take 2 tabs and have one for later. This plug claimed his tabs were 300ug, but you can never really know the dosage of these things. He pulls up and its already late, about 9:30, he gives me the ten strip wrapped in foil. My friends and I are excited.
Finally we take our tabs

10:00 PM
(Everyone except Ashley took acid. She was going to be the sitter)

Initally we all take just one tab and anxiously wait for the cid to kick in

10:30 PM
Fred took an extra two tabs! I honestly didn't know why but he did. I said fuck it and took my other two tabs. Now our plan of only doing 300ug is out the window so David and Johnny take another tab. Looking back now I realized how fucking stupid we were :/

11:00 PM
Recap- Fred and I took 900ug and Johhny and David took 600ug, Ashley is trip sitting.
After about an hour we all start to feel it. We all laugh at each other and the mood was perfect. Every little joke we'd say made us burst out in laughter. Arguably  the best part of the entire trip.

12:00 PM

Im getting the best body high of gotten from acid, everything was bliss and my headspace was so clear. That was until David said we had to leave or else his Dad would get mad, thats tuff, we said our goodbyes and left. Fred was going to drop Johnny and I home.

 (LET ME BE CLEAR Driving whilst under the influence is very fucking dangerous and can get you in big fucking trouble!)

Anyways
We're in the car and Fred's going to drop off Johnny first since he lived closer. Fred was driving, Johnny was in the backseat, and I was in the passenger seat. The whole vibe inside the car was off, nobody was saying a thing and it felt very depressing. I tried to clear up the air by talking and asking if everyone was alright. But by the minute I was getting higher and more paranoid.
I started hallucinating blue and red lights in the side view mirror, in a panic I kept telling Fred that the police were chasing us. Fred asked me if I called the fucking cops, I said ""hell no fuck that shit."" I kept seeing lights but I had to tell myself they're not real, I quickly shut the fuck up because I didnt want anyone else to start panicking. Johnny got dropped off and we said bye. Fred and I started talking, I forgot what about exactly, but I remember that it was some heavy shit. The song Digital Bath started playing. Crazy good song, the music vibrated in my ears and I could feel the song influencing the visuals. Finally I got home and right before I stepped out of the car Fred said, ""so I guess this is it no more all of us"" (he was talking about our friend group) before I had anytime to react he left. I was like wtf and just got inside.

1:00 AM

Im tripping fucking tits as I watch youtube and listen to music. I dont remember what I was thinking about  but I do know that I wasn't in a bad state of mind despite looping about random things. So my friends and I are in a groupchat and out of nowhere Fred leaves the chat. We all text eachother and try to call him, we're all very worried about him. We ask eachother how we feel and I tell them im looping and my friend David said he was looping. (David later told me that he was looping and asking his girlfriend where we all are, he felt really bad as he thought he was driving his girl insane.) Johnny said he was fine.

2:00 AM - 4:00 AM

Tripping, seeing every little intricate pattern and design flowing in the carpet. It looks like everything in my vision was alive, I remember looking at the ceiling and seeing stars all shining down on me. Every little sound echoed with force and I vividly remember listening to the sound of my own laugh and it played back slower and slower sounding menacing. At this point the concept of time and space didnt exist I was simply energy flowing through reality. I vividly remember that I kept seeing the number 5 pop up in my youtube videos and in my surroundings, I began to loop that the number 5 was the meaning to life and everything was somehow connected to it. I kept forgetting and ultimately stopped looping! 

4:00 AM - 5:00 AM

I was finally coming down, but nowhere near being sober, I was watching psychedsubstance and his face was completely symmetrical it looked funny as hell. Then I remember laying down on my bed and my bed sheet became alive it was moving and breathing, it looked like a monster, I thought that was so cool! 

6:00AM 

I talked to Johhny on video call and he explained his trip to me, he said he just played mad max the whole time. He also explained that he kept looping in mad max, I then said that hes looping of the mad max and we both died of laughter. 

After that I was basically coming down the whole day, still slightly seeing visuals even at 7 PM 

TLDR;
Said fuck it and took 900ug, tripped tits and it was  not good but not bad either, just kinda eh


My thoughts

Definitely regret that my friends and I took acid that day, not because I had a bad trip, but because my friend group was never the same after that we all just seemed more distant :/
Obviously no one should take 900ug unless they truly feel they're ready and what I did could've easily been a nightmare trip. My friend Fred said he had a terrible  trip.

It had about 4 blue pills and when I went back to my room and looked at the pill ID's and Google'd them, I found out it was 10 mg amphetamine salts.


The person who had this was not prescribed it (otherwise it would've been in a prescription bottle). It astonishes me how someone carelessly dropped this shit on the floor. These pills can go for $20 a pill each on the street (depending on who you're selling it too).


Anyway, how in the fuck do you just drop this shit accidentally ? It's not like you can just buy goodies like these from the store. I'll use this blues on a rainy day. I enjoy it once in awhile, although not my drug of choice, but it was free !",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,684052,public,confidence,self,How can someone be careless enough to drop drugs on the floor in a public place ?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gyr0eh/how_can_someone_be_careless_enough_to_drop_drugs/,no_ads,0.0,1591615511.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This community is generally more accepting and tolerant of crazy ideas, so I though this would be the best place to post it. Sorry if this gets overly political. Here goes... 

With all that’s going on right now, it seems like everything we see in the internet is videos and stories of police officers assaulting people unnecessarily and the likes. 
Obviously one plausible reason for this is social media filtering, where because everyone is talking about a particular thing, that’s the only thing you’ll see. And obviously the more posts you click on relating to this particular thing, the more of it you’ll see-in this case, cases of police brutality and white supremacists. 

But I had another thought as to why we’re seeing so much of this civil unrest right now where seemingly everyone is being pitted against each other. Call me crazy, downvote me, I don’t care, I just wanted to get this thought out there. So my thought is this: 

What if Russia is meddling with the situation in the US right now to escalate the problem, creating bots on social media to polarize opinions, possibly even creating fake videos and the likes to show more police brutality than there actually is, with the intention of pitting the people against their government? They did this in the 2016 elections, so we already know this is possible. What if they are trying to create more polarization along party lines, creating more division in the United States between different parties-republicans and democrats, whites and blacks, the rich and the poor, the government and its people? 

The death of George Floyd created the perfect scenario for them to tamper with the American political situation. Many people were already unhappy with the government for quarantining people for longer than necessary because of the pandemic, and now George Floyd’s death further highlighted the government’s shortcomings. It would be easy to tamper with the situation, creating fake accounts with the sole purpose of further polarizing people’s opinions on the matter, making right leaning people lean further right and left leaning people lean further left. 

Russia has also allowed white supremacist organizations to grow and train people to fight, according to this link  [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/g5pqk4/german-neo-nazis-are-getting-explosives-training-at-a-white-supremacist-camp-in-russia)

, so it wouldn’t be a surprise if they were somehow using this as a way to sow discord in the United States.

I was thinking about all the weird shit I end up doing while on drugs and started to wonder what it's like for other people.

With weed/ketamine/DXM, I usually just end up throwing on a twitch stream and staring at my ceiling. On acid or shrooms I watch hours of sciencey youtube videos, vsauce is my all-time favorite. All relatively normal stuff.

On stims, though? Stims get weird. I'll spend 5-6 hours photoshopping families in stock photos to look as fucked up as possible without sacrificing realism. Elongating noses, lowering one eye, erasing eyebrows, widening foreheads. Sometimes I take out teeth or add bruises or a black eye. I go in and make sure it's as seamless and realistic as I can get it. Cloning skin textures, fixing hue/saturation, using overlays, separate layers with different blending modes. Sometimes I try to tell a story with it. I called my last creation ""the goblin lord and his battered slave boy."" I shared that one with my dad a while ago and all he responded with was ""why?"" And I didn't fucking know.

Now I sometimes work on this shit while sober because it's surprisingly fun. It's like art but without the hard part where you make something from nothing. I've gotten pretty good at using the program and have even been considering offering to retouch/colorize photos for people so I can feel like I'm actually doing something useful. Not sure if I'd be able to resist shrinking a hand or two though.

SECOND PARAGRAPH FOR TRIP REPORT

Male, under 25, 180lbs bw, ~11% bodyfat so not a lightweight

So, this was something somewhat surprising to me but it was easily the single most amazing and intense experience of my life. I think it would benefit my explanation if I started from the beginning, so: I began using drugs in november of this year with nos (excluding alcohol once or twice before). After that I tried weed, and it was very enjoyable to me. However, I limited my use as much as possible because I am concerned about its effect on brain development for people under 25 (like me). Anyway, I documented all of my drug use up to this point, never using more than once or twice a week. I first tried mushrooms around January, starting with 2g a few times, then 2.5g, then 3.5g (always Golden Teachers), always leaving 2 weeks between trips. Fast forward to April, my dealer has acid so I give it a shot with half a tab of what my dealer said was 100ug (tested with Earlich reagent). Much easier experience than shrooms for me. 
____
This week, I tried a single tested ~100ug tab at night (I should mention I've only had a trip sitter once before in all my experience, and didn't this time either). I got some cool effects and music was greatly enhanced, but the visuals were relatively mild for me compared to shrooms. I decided to vape a single cap of bud in my Dynavap, because weed tends to greatly enhance my trip ime. I laid down in my bed and began to seriously trip out, but still with only a moderate amount of visuals, probably comparable to 2g of shrooms. The full body euphoria was extremely intense however, more than I had ever felt on shrooms or anything else. I was enjoying my music but decided to completely turn of all lights in my room and take off my headphones, because it felt like the music was keeping me ""grounded"". As soon as I laid down in the dark with complete silence, I began to feel lost, and then I suddenly wasn't ""I"" anymore. It felt as if what I thought was ""I"" was just a part of the universe as a whole, observing itself. It has always seemed to me that organic lives' thoughts and actions are really just laws of physics playing themselves out similar to how a chemical reaction might, but it truly became apparent at that moment. It became obvious that aliens must exist through a similar sort of evolutionary process like we went to. This also reaffirmed my previous thinking that nothing we do is truly of free will, and is only the product of chemical reactions and electrical impulses, etc. that occurs in our brain. If time were wound back, everything would play out the same way. I've heard that you can experience ego death without any drugs being necessary and I've tried extensively with meditation before, so I think this could have helped me.

Also, I wanna mention that this experience also improved my work ethic and helped erase moderate social anxiety I had learned to cope with. No other experience on psychedelics has lastingly impacted me even close to this amount.

 I take other precautions before I blaze such as candles, oil defusers and air fresheners as well as an air purifier however I'm more interested in the fact if the air purifier has an effect against the odour at all.

also if you have any tips for hiding the smell of weed odour that would be great.

I just want to get it off my chest.
I was fifteen years old, and since I had smoked pot for the first time when I was twelve, I was completely in love with getting high in any way possible. I had been partying with a girl from school for a bit, and that night I had already been drinking a little bit, not enough to be drunk but just a little tipsy. 
This girl had some older guys come by, in their twenties, to drop off some weed. We went through the whole transaction and they invited us over. My friend said no, but I was hoping they’d have stuff other than weed to get me fucked up so I went on without her. 
They drove me to one of the guys’ house (who I’ll call Joe), and we went into his moms garage. Not a great vibe overall, but I ignored my gut instinct and kept hanging out with the guys. 
They had a small pile of maybe three or four little stick mods on the floor, and I asked if Joe if I could hit one. He was cool with it, and upon hitting it I didn’t feel the usual buzz in my head I associate with nicotine, instead feeling a light, floating feeling beginning towards the back of my brain, and a heaviness in my body. Again, I ignored my instinct and kept hitting it. 
Joe then informed me it was Ketamine. I didn’t mind, however I had never done any research on Ketamine, or knew what it would do to me. I slouched back against the wall and kept vaping, while my consciousnesses came to rest against the ceiling, peacefully floating and swaying above my physical form like a balloon. 
I can’t say how much time passed between floating above my body and realizing I could no longer move, but I can’t imagine it was very long. I was sitting up against the wall, my hand still holding onto the mod, resting against my chest. It was at this time Joe started to try and talk to me. 
I couldn’t get my mouth to cooperate, or any of my muscles, so I looked over at him through my half closed eyes. 
I don’t know if he saw that as an invitation. I don’t know if getting me so fucked up so he could take advantage of me was his plan all along. 
Anyways, I turn eighteen in less than a month.

My body weight is currently at 94kg’s, I’m 20 years old studying hence why these beautiful medications help me far beyond than what I could do on my own. And I take magnesium supplements, with omega fish oil three times daily and a cup of water mixed with all of the amminos. I’ll now jump to the point and stop with my ranting but However, I’ve been experiencing really just tired behaviours in the afternoons when I ween off or come off of my medication or feel like that I really want to interact with my family but I don’t want to at the same time. I still do and fight these negative side effects alone since my body has been ajusted towards it but also the long night walks help dramatically but the one thing that I find is that, getting to sleeps is so fu**ing difficult no matter what, mike my language

Does anyone here have any propositions or experiences that they can share? 
I’m currently take Dexedrine IR 40mg a day I total but split from morning too afternoon?

My docs also prescribed me Melatonin pills which are a miracle and do help but however it’s not a 100% guarantee miracle drug that actually helps with my insomnia all of the time. I apologise for the messy paragraphs, grammar and rant. I haven’t had my medication just yet but is 40mg a high dose do you reckon? Or should I consider to swapping to Vyvanse 70mg with my current behaviour issues that my doc knows and tolerance form 40mg.He also mentioned I have to take 1 A day? Cause my doc said that vyvanse is less abusive and smoother in a way compared to Dexedrine in general and I get my dexamfetamine bottles that come in 100 and vyvanse comes in 30 that requires 1 day? On top of that, I’ve herd people staying that Vyvanse doesn’t last as long as it offers on their site :/ I just want the more effective treatment to help me focus during my study coming up?

I'm sorry if this isn't allowed here, i'm just pretty desperate and don't know how to calm myself down. I also posted this on r/shrooms

So about a month and a half ago my girlfriend and I (19,F) had our first trips (1.8G) and it was amazing. I had a great time overall and was excited to do shrooms again. So we did end up taking more (2.0G) about a week later and I did end up having a minor bad trip. I was mainly just uncomfortable because of the setting. A month later we did it again (3.0G) and that was a major bad trip, I invited someone I shouldn't have and it completely freaked me out and threw off my emotions. Now the last one was exactly 4 days ago (2.0G) and it was the worst one I've had. I would explain it as unbearable, I felt like I couldn't breathe, couldn't think, and as if I was gonna go crazy and actually die. I admit I don't think I was in the right mindset at all to do shrooms the 4th time, and I truly regret it now.

The trip has passed and I thought I'd recovered from it but the day after I had already noticed I was super emotional. Now I feel super on edge and like i'm always scared about something. I get so panicked i feel like im gonna die. It's only been 4 days but its been horrible. I constantly think about things that worry me or make me sad. I get a feeling of overwhelming isolation/grief/fear. And I just can't get my mind on anything else no matter how hard I try. Is there anyone who's gone through the same thing? What advice can you give me? I feel super alone although my girlfriend has been with me the entire time and has been super supportive. It's to the point of me considering emergency mental health because I just don't know what else to do. Will this pass?

I have recently found out the anxiety is escalated by weed which is horrible because I am a frequent weed smoker and I've never experienced weed and extreme anxiety together.

Now, I got diclazepam to taper better but when I got it, I fucked the taper up for 3 days straight and now only have 11mg diclazepam left. Being that I’ve only used for 2 months, but in higher doses, would a week of tapering be fine?? Also keep in mind, I was already at a low dose before I decided to fuck the taper up..


Anyways, I might have lyrica if that does any good but I don’t want to count on that arriving. Am I in seizure territory after just fucking up a taper for 3 days? Can I get back on track dosing 1mg diclazepam (= to 10mg Valium), for a week and then just jump
From there? 


Like I said, hopefully I’ll have lyrica to help with WD’s. I’m not sure if it helps with the seizure threshold though. I’m not counting on my package to arrive either so this will most likely be the situation that happens. Any advice? And answers to the seizure part are greatly appreciated!

My close friend pulled out a bag of coke and offered me some. I have never tried it before and was nervous, but I was in the mindset that “hey, this is a group of people I feel safe with, I just got a job, I can give it try.” So I did.

Things went fine, cocaine isn’t for me. I’m glad I know that now, and all is good.... Until Monday (June 1st), when I receive an email from the drug testing company saying the first test I took care back as a “negative-dilute“ and that I was going to have to test again. Cue me freaking the fuck out. 

I scheduled my test for Thursday June 5th, and took it then. In between I didn’t drink alcohol and just drank lots of water and ate well. 

Basically I want to know, will I be okay? I feel like such an ass-hat for all of this happening, and am kicking myself so hard for being careless. I would love and advice or anecdotes from people who have been in a similar situation.

TLDR; I tried coke for the first time and then got drug tested 4ish days later.

I can’t quite figure out wtf this is lol so I’m just going to list every effect I’ve noticed: 

- after about 30m I felt my heart racing &amp; that ‘coming up soon’ feeling (which didn’t amount to a peak)

- pupils are constricted to fuck

- I feel really numb, like my hands/feet are kinda tingly 

- initially I felt really drowsy and worn out, kinda like coming up on shrooms but without the trippininess and upcoming euphoria.. then it mellowed out to a wobbly buzz feeling, like mellow electricity 

- I feel I couldn’t sleep rn but I don’t feel energised, nor have the desire to do anything productive, but my eyes feel OPEN yet my body feels light, and drained

- typical dry mouth, no appetite, dry eye feeling

- I’m noticing more sounds, I can hear little noises I don’t usually notice like the fabric of my clothes rubbing


The substance was white and powdery, but with a thick dry malleable feeling... kinda like speed paste but it wasn’t wet. It also tasted intensely bitter and made my gums a tiny bit numb but not as it would with coke 

To see if drying it a bit would make a difference, I hot plated it &amp; sniffed a lil bump and I felt again ‘mildly coming up’ energised for about 2mins then back to this weird numb, tingly feeling



The most noticeable feelings are A LOT of numbness, lack of effort-ness, awake dry eye feeling and a tiny bit chatty (but not euphoric).. it’s kind of like K, but not? 

My best guess would be some mix of K with speed, so I’m just wondering if this is a common mix? I’ve never bombed k before so idk if it feels any different that way, but I just kind of feel down and up simultaneously and it’s just really strange, soo just wondering if anyone knows what street speed is commonly cut with that could lead to these effects?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,683943,public,confidence,self,What drug have I taken?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gyihjh/what_drug_have_i_taken/,no_ads,0.0,1591586371.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But I’m at a loss right now and could use an outside source to help. Unless it’s above Reddit’s pay grade. 

Thank you to everyone that commented on my previous post. It just further justified my feelings. 

But things went from ok to worse. I broke down crying in the car on the highway and pulled over to a store to write this;

He hasn’t stopped. When I brought up a few weeks ago (around the time of my first post) to him my concern, he said “well I’m not up all night partying and I’m going to work. Stop worrying!”

Last week he didn’t go to work. He works for himself and always going for quotes and stuff. To the point that it ruins my day because I take him. But man I wish I was taking him. He’s do 2-5 quotes a day after pulling a full work day. 

Not. One. Quote. All Week. No. Work. Nada. 

Now he thinks someone has been coming into the house or on our property. In his Defense, he’s been saying that on and off for a year but now it’s obsessive. His tools have gone missing (maybe he misplaced them?) the vegetables were broken (animals?) his flowers in his garden snapped (animal?) a rock was turned over so that means someone stepped there. But he did show me a foot print in the soil two days ago so thought....maybe...?

So no he is going from window to window seeing if anyone is on our property. He is staying up until 4-5o’oclock in the morning going over the yard trying to catch someone trespassing. (We don’t make a lot but rent an old house in a very affluent area, so not ghetto) then sleeping until 9:30-10am. He has put boards with nails sticking out of it in the harden so if someone is going in at night, will step on them. Told him what happens if my niece is around??

He is now pulling all the smoke detectors out and finding thing that are glued to it. Thinks they are bugs. Cutting wires in the house. They are just the motherboards. 

He actually JUST called me saying that an alarm is going off a block over and he thinks he’s going to be arrested. And also mentioned that he now thinks his dealer is a cop. He’s really becoming unhinged

Which brings me to my next point. He told me if he is arrested to call his aunt. His aunt is like a mother to him. We were there two weeks ago and I asked him if she knew of his habit. He said no way. 

So, one question is, do I tell his aunt? Maybe not the drug of choice, but that he needs help and he is losing it? Is this an ok thing to do? Is it violating our relationship? How does one coup with a partner spiralling.... 

He doesn’t see how he is acting. He gets in my face, thinks I’m too loud and the neighbours hear me.

NOT ENCOURAGING ANYONE TO DO IT,

Okay. So, I made this recipe because there isn’t a lot of syrups contain either codeine or codeine with prometh. All I get to do is Dihydrocodeine was and it is not bad at the beginning. But nowadays it is, as it doesn’t feel the same and before because of tolerance.

I am coursed Chemistry in IB for the sole reason to learn from meds and think about new ways to get me high. And now that I graduated and all. I’m introducing you the best recipe ever done. It is just perfect, it’s effect is power. Power.


Let’s start.

*This recipe is meant for four people

MATERIALS: 

•Codeine Phosphate 30mg, 30 pills

•Benadryl 75mg

•Ethyl Alcohol (can be the one at the drugstore)
(If you rather not use alcohol you need to drink like 3/4 beers)

•Coffee filters, or any filter 

OPTIONAL

•Thermomether for better results.

FIRST PROCESS:

Decantation: Cold Water extraction. 

1. Divide your 30/34 pills into two piles, they must be the same quantity.

2. Put each pile into a bag, being you left with two bags with aprox. 15 pills each.

3. Now you are going to crush the bags until all the pills are crushed into dust. 

4. Next up, is filling two different glasses of water. And microwaving them until they hit 31°C/81°F (aprox. 200mL)

5. Once the water is hot, pour in each glass using the coffee filter one bag of the crushed pills. Remember one bag in one cup. Leaving us with a white, sour flavor “syrup” but without Paracetamol.

6. Get them to the refrigerator and let the two cups be, until they reach a temperature of 9ºC/50ºF. DON'T LET THEM freeze or you will loose codeine. 

7. Once they're cold you're now required to filter them in another cup, so filter both solutions into one cup. Stir well, and repeat the process if needed.

 
ROSTAVIS PREPARATION

1.Now that you have your own codeine cup into one cup, we are going to divide it again into two.

2.In my country Benadryl comes as syrup so I just pour syrup (50mL). If you have pills be sure to be popping 25mg.

3. Lastly, you are going to add one shot of alcohol. Exactly 12mL to the mixture.

Therefore, every 275mL is an 8oz Actavis. Raw syrup. And even worse taste, but it is worth the sacrifice.

Now for the taste I haven't figured it out much to make it better, only things you can now right now is stay with something sweet, such like dummies and all that

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you may know Promethazine is sometimes classified as a S3 and it isn’t easy to collect, although if you are lucky enough to get your hand on it, you’re lucky

Any way, that’s why I looked up for an alternative with almost its same effects and that what’s Benadryl.

How to roll a joint whilst walking or in heavy wind: 

This is originally a Moroccan technique I think, and how i first learnt. Put your weed (and tobacco if spliffing) into a line in your hand, place your paper over the top, hold your hands flat together like a sandwich and flip over, be quick to bring your hand into a gully and grab/pinch your paper with your free hand. With practise, you should be able to go straight to a rolled position with your hand pinching the whole build shut and protected from blowing away. A pro can cycle handsfree and roll at the same time

Perfectly rolled cones: 

Once you've aligned all the contents of your spliff/joint, packing more away from the roach, the trick to a perfect roll is when you start actually rolling up, do not let go of the roach. If you twist with one hand and don't let go, you naturally form a perfect cone. Your other hand helps guide the twist and sort out contents; simply pulling the paper taut at points in the twist is usually enough

Use a warm/hot knife for cutting hash: Pretty sure I dont need to explain this one

Fixing clumpy powders:

Quick way to fix clumping is to warm a plate in the microwave to just above body temperature, easy enough to hold. Put your coke or whatever on your warm plate. Now when you chop it up, it'll powder better

Ketamine for first timers: 

This is key to a lot of drugs, but I can't stress enough with K, is start of real small and work up. Like a flat pile 3mm long on a slim door key. Hit it too hard and you may scare yourself off a fun dissociative 

Fluffier ketamine:

If you're cooking up from the vial, add a bit of water to the solution; this seems to allow the solution to crystallize finer and the result is less sticky. If you've already got a bag of shards and some patience, you can rehydrate the crystals a little and then dehydrate and chop up. Fluffier ketamine really seems to allow better absorption, quicker/better highs, and the bag lasts so much longer! Go gently on the dehydration

XTC/Acid doesn't have brands:

I shouldn't have to explain this, but it's a thing. You can say that a batch is good, but that stamp and colour isn't a brand, anyone can make them. Dont trust a pill because you've seen its 'type' before. If you're gonna test your drugs, pills are the most notorious I've found for not really knowing what's in there

Recycled meth:

Okay, I dont really like meth, and I've never tried this, but I've learnt this to be a thing... meth doesn't break down in the body, so you piss it out. Meaning you can drink meth piss and get fucked up on it again. Not my cup of tea, but if Bear Grylls did drugs...

Snorting: 

Designate a nostril. If it's blocking up, unblock it, or wait till you can unblock it. It helps you manage your amount, and it's less bother sleeping or the next day. You dont need to close the other nostril, your aim is to get it to your nasal capillaries, not the back of your throat. Also, use your own straw

Doing shots for beginners:

Blow out all your air. Slam your shot, immediately after take a deep breath in through your nose, and blow out through your mouth. You're now a pro

Curing and drying makes the difference: 

If you're growing weed and or tobacco, curing really defines your product at the end. Patience again is essential. Weed usually wants min a month, tobacco 3 months till just smokeable but really warrants even longer. Slow dries without issues almost always are better products 

Making bombs: 

Powder up your MDMA or other drug, if not yet powdery, for faster absorption. Half a rolling paper so you have two equal sticky sides. Lick the glue and fold to one side so you have a triangular pocket to pour your powder into (I'm not gonna suggest measures because I used to be a beast. Keep below 0.1g probably). Fold open end and swallow with a drink

Making a drug-wrap:

Fold a small piece of paper into an equal triangle and remove excess side if any. With the folded side on the bottom, fold right side 1/3rd into the middle, and left side 1/3rd into the middle and tucked into the opening of the right side. Fold the top of the triangle down to complete the square, and then fold the whole wrap in half horizontally so that the top flap folds behind your folded corners

Get a fannypack/bumbag:

It's so convenient having all your drugs in a designated space if you're out partying. You'll lose less shit

Learn the recovery position:

At some point you may have a friend who's a bit too wasted and just needs to sleep it off. Put your mind at ease, learn the recovery position and implement it. You could save a life

Upper comedowns: 

Hydrate, eat a banana, put on a Pixar movie and get as comfy as possible. Rest. You can buy 5HTP serotonin replacements in lots of health stores now

Chew gum on uppers if you have problems gurning, or suck a lollipop to distract the mouth altogether. Frozen grapes always make me happy too

Comeups from downers:

Drowsiness is what we're able to fight here. A spoon of honey or a sweet tea can really help with Ketamine confusion; gets the senses going

Know your waiting times before redosing:

Dont drop again thinking ""this isn't working"" within 3-4 hours on mushrooms and acid, 2-3 hours for pills (X) MDMA 2CB/2CI... (these being the ones people most commonly FU)

When tripping, remember you're on drugs, but try not to resist the affects; resistance makes for a bad trip

Increasing your high: 

Mdma: music. Not sure why you wouldn't have music playing, but music literally stimulates MDMA, it's science

Weed: Mangos. Mango juice or smoothies are bitching anyway but also help improve your buzz. More science for ya! 

When picking weed, pistils are whitest fresh, and brown and curl the more cbd builds up (strains colour respectively, judge accordingly) giving you a rough idea of thc/cbd ratio

Mushrooms: Like alcohol, don't eat other stuff. If you wanna sober up, eat. Science! 

Whippits: stop blowing back up that balloon, you're here for NOS, not CO2. Your balloon full of carbon dioxide will black you out with angry science

There is only 2 confirmed covid cases where I’m from and I essentially quarantined for 2 months at work so don’t get upset over that. But I got a 3 hour nap in the truck then a 2 hour nap at home so I was fucking exhausted. I wake up to my buddy’s at my door with a line of yayo, a bottle and beer for me so I said fuck it I’m only here for 4 days then I’m off again why not degen it up.

So I bust out the ketamine give them a small-medium dose and I take a tiny one (they loved it) because I’m not trying to be all wonky meeting people. We hang for a bit and I say I had to go but I’ll meet up later, I had plans with my other friends. Do more ketamine and coke with this other friend and get dabbed tf out still feel alright just kinda tired. 

Then later that night we got a penthouse hotel and there’s like 30 of us there and I start going hard pounding drinks, mixing coke and ket but still feel normal then I take a fat fucking dab like .4 don’t finish it then I feel all woozy, and I start to hear my friends say go to bed man somewhat aggressively like they all wanted me out of the room, so I comply. While I’m in the room I hear them just belittling me and shitting on me like it was a conspiracy, like I mean every single one of my close friends just completing RAGGING on me. I was so convinced because they were having like full on conversations about me.

I was so sad, I haven’t seen no one for 2 months I wanted to jump out the window or leave and never come back. I was also thinking they thought I was fucked up because I brought this drug (ketamine) which none of them have tried, and got all geeked up on it.

(I forgot to add that earlier in the day we went to Harry Rosen and I bought a ferragamo belt. No idea why I was just fucked out of my tree lol. This comes in to play after.)

I eventually decide I need to say something about them talking shit so I take off the belt walk out the door and give some speech which I barely remember, but I was saying stuff like everyone fucking hates me, you guys all think I’m a douche cause I bought this belt, and that I got this hotel because I just wanted everyone to have fun cause I haven’t seen them in forever. And I walked up to one of my best buddies and had what he explained a insane look on my face with a huge smile, cheek to cheek my pupils were pinholed wide open saying you fucking hate me, you never liked me etc, same shit. And he had no clue what I was talking about. 

I go back in the room and breakdown crying and losing it eventually they finally have me convinced that It was all in my head cause they had no clue what the fuck I was talking about. I snap out of it and it’s like nothing happened. 

It seems like drug induced psychosis but I’m just worried because my uncle has schizophrenia brought on from drugs and my mom and sister are bpd and bipolar. I think this is my end of the drug scene atleast for the near future.


TLDR: mixed coke and ket bought a expensive belt for no reason heard voices went nuts thought I was either crazy or everyone hated me.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,683906,public,confidence,self,Schizophrenia or bad pychosis episode?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gyer5d/schizophrenia_or_bad_pychosis_episode/,no_ads,0.0,1591573812.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To get started I’ve done psychedelics like shrooms and acid and felt like I did pretty well on them and I could handle something else — and after seeing salvia around I was always enamored by the thought of some spiritual guidance, scoured the internet for it, watched some dumbass jump out of the window, and so I get some 10x and even some 20x in case I wanted something stronger after. Anyways, lock myself in the room while my parents are asleep and measure about .1g of the 10x, reading that this would be the regular dosage and isn’t too much. Put it in a bong, roll down the window and light the entire bowl. One side of my face felt like it was drooping off but no effects really after a few minutes. So about 15 minutes later I set myself a timer for 20 minutes and I load up about .2g this time and torch the whole bowl again and after releasing the smoke, I felt my vision closing up and fell backwards onto my bed. 

I was the king of the nation, but my time was running out. Revolutionaries were after me and had broken into my castle. I had no choice with the enemy banging on the door. I had to escape out of the window. I remember so vividly feeling clutching the brick wall with my knuckles and fingers scraping as I try to shimmy my way out of my window. I couldn’t hold on however. I must have fallen atleast a hundred feet as I crashed through the pavement and I was gone again. 

I felt like I was in a terrible nightmare that never ended, because now I was outside my house shaking my door handle trying to get in. I was absolutely frightened and ran ragged and my only thought was that I had to get back to my room to end the dream. Locked outside, and I felt like at this point I was in a lucid dream. How the fuck am I outside the house? Why is it locked? Why did my mind take me here? I had to end up shimmying through the dog door in my backyard to get back inside as I had no key and found my bedroom with the door still locked. This was when I was sure I was in my dream because the door is still locked so I never truly left. The door felt like it was shining an aura and I knew this was the moment of truth. I imagined my body still in my bed but when I unlocked the door, it was just my bedroom with the window open, just like I left it. 

I look at the timer I had left on my phone by my bedside and realized it’s been fifteen minutes after I took the hit, and was so relieved that it was over and I’m safe in my room. I’m not tripping, but I started to ache and realized the cuts all over my arms and legs. My ribs were bruised and all the pieces start to be put together and realized that me being outside was no dream at all. I look out the window, and maybe 15-20 feet below is my A/C unit was totally crushed and I can see my glasses on the ground next to it. I’m just shocked, and immediately realized how fucked I am with this. The next morning my parents are filing a police report and they have to get the AC fixed and they are livid. They asked me if I jumped out of the window or something to sneak out, but I told them how silly that was that I didn’t need to sneak out because they don’t care what I do really and I’ve always been a good kid. It upset me how much I upset my parents with this and how much they trusted me, and how I managed to fuck it up because I’m the one dude on drugs who jumps out window. Anyways, there goes most of my savings account, and I’m not sure how I’m going to explain to my parents *WHY* I jumped out a window. I feel like Salvia taught me a grave lesson on the vulnerability in life. Wish me luck with my parents. 

TL;DR: I jumped out of my window on salvia and destroyed my parent’s $3000 A/C unit. Please have a trip sitter with you if you take salvia.

I have such mixed emotions about me using and I'm not really sure where to go from here.

I was sober for about 5 months. I absolutely did not want to be sober, but I stuck with it and gritted my teeth. The whole time I dreaded being sober. I hated it. Every second I was writing in a notebook about how I can't wait to get high blah blah. I never worked on my recovery, I was just dryyyy asf. I got kicked out of a halfway house (for being an asshole pretty much) so I just sold all my Suboxone and bought heroin. A week later I came to a new recovery house (as of my probation orders.) Was clean for a month + maybe a week or two. I saw a friend and he gave me fentadope and a oxy that was most likely pressed. I didn't even ask for it he kinda just handed it to me and said it's what he had  leftover. So I did those for a couple days and it was quite lovely. The only thing I didn't like is that I didn't have a needle so I had to sniff em but whatever, still did the trick. I had my fun &amp; didn't continue right away after that time. I didn't feel bad or scared about it at all. I missed it &amp; couldn't wait for more, but I knew I couldn't do that.

 So I behaved myself for a couple more weeks. Memorial day I went to my mom's house. I had some drugs left there from before I got locked up; a little bit of meth, 4 bags of fent, two syringes and about 5mg of xanax. I knew I couldn't use them right then so I brought them back with me. I shot all the fentanyl in a few hours, then two days later I took the xanax. I guess I was dozing off sitting up in my bed when the house manager was checking rooms I obviously looked suspicious/high. I was asked to give a urine the following morning &amp; I complied, knew I was gonna come up dirty, let them know what happened. They were pretty gracious to me. I could be on the street or back in jail right now. I took my punishment seriously &amp; behaved myself up until last night. I guess I allowed myself to """"""forget"""""" what *just* happened. 

I had reason to believe I am in the clear from receiving another urine test soon so I decided to shoot the meth I had. I really never had an interest in trying meth before. Why did I do it then? Fuck if I know. There was absolutely no reason for it. Except cravings and simply not giving a shit. I was going to it sooner but I didn't feel totally comfortable about it so I waited. I was so nervous at first. I've never shot meth before so I was anxious asf. So yeah I guess I decided it was a good idea. I didn't do a lot, and I feel fairly normal right now. I'm kinda coming down. I'm defs not high anymore but I'm defs not sober 😓 I don't feel too bad but I know I feel different and I know I fucked up. 

I know I shouldn't have done it. I know what regulations I am breaking, I know what I am risking, I know what I did is not okay and I know that these people will not be so gracious to me this time. It isn't fair to my family, the owners or the other women who live here either. 

 But my head is so fucked up. I started coming down a little &amp; I realised how bad I fucked up, how there was no reason for this at all. It hit me that I really have no control over what I am doing, and I have no clue what I'm doing at all, no matter how much bullshit I tell myself. And honestly I am scared. Yes, I am scared of what consequences I might end up facing but overall I am scared of myself, and my insanely stupid thinking, my stupid rationalization, my fucking impulsivity... My carelessness. What the fuck am I actually doing??? 

I don't know what I want to do either. I want to keep getting high, I want to go get like six bundles and say ""fuck everything"" a not care about anything anymore. But I don't really have that choice. I really have to fucking get my shit together. I literally have no choice but to get my shit together.

How to roll a joint whilst walking or in heavy wind: 

This is originally a Moroccan technique I think, and how i first learnt. Put your weed (and tobacco if spliffing) into a line in your hand, place your paper over the top, hold your hands flat together like a sandwich and flip over, be quick to bring your hand into a gully and grab/pinch your paper with your free hand. With practise, you should be able to go straight to a rolled position with your hand pinching the whole build shut and protected from blowing away. 

Perfectly rolled cones: 

Once you've aligned all the contents of your spliff/joint, packing more away from the roach, the trick to a perfect roll is when you start actually rolling up, do not let go of the roach. If you twist with one hand and dont let go, you naturally form a perfect cone. Your other hand helps guide the twist and sort out contents; simply pulling the paper taut at points in the twist is usually enough

Use a warm/hot knife for cutting hash: Pretty sure I dont need to explain this one

Fixing clumpy powders:

Quick way to fix clumping is to warm a plate in the microwave to just above body temperature, easy enough to hold. Put your coke or whatever on your warm plate. Now when you chop it up, it'll powder better

Ketamine for first timers: 

This is key to a lot of drugs, but I can't stress enough with K, is start of real small and work up. Like a flat pile 3mm long on a slim door key. Hit it too hard and you may scare yourself off a fun dissociative 

Fluffier ketamine:

If you're cooking up from the vial, add a bit of water to the solution; this seems to allow the solution to crystallize finer and the result is less sticky. If you've already got a bag of shards and some patience, you can rehydrate the crystals a little and then dehydrate and chop up. Fluffier ketamine really seems to allow better absorption, quicker/better highs, and the bag lasts so much longer! Go gently on the dehydration

XTC/Acid doesn't have brands:

I shouldn't have to explain this, but it's a thing. You can say that a batch is good, but that stamp and colour isn't a brand, anyone can make them. Dont trust a pill because you've seen its 'type' before. If you're gonna test your drugs, pills are the most notorious I've found for not really knowing what's in there

Recycled meth:

Okay, I dont really like meth, and I've never tried this, but I've learnt this to be a thing... meth doesn't break down in the body, so you piss it out. Meaning you can drink meth piss and get fucked up on it again. Not my cup of tea, but if Bear Grylls did drugs...

Snorting: 

Designate a nostril. If it's blocking up, unblock it, or wait till you can unblock it. It helps you manage your amount, and it's less bother sleeping or the next day. You dont need to close the other nostril, your aim is to get it to your nasal capillaries, not the back of your throat. Also, use your own straw

Doing shots for beginners:

Blow out all your air. Slam your shot, immediately after take a deep breath in through your nose, and blow out through your mouth. You're now a pro

Curing and drying makes the difference: 

If you're growing weed and or tobacco, curing really defines your product at the end. Patience again is essential. Weed usually wants min a month, tobacco 3 months till just smokeable but really warrants even longer. Slow dries without issues almost always are better products 

Making bombs: 

Powder up your MDMA or other drug, if not yet powdery, for faster absorption. Half a rolling paper so you have two equal sticky sides. Lick the glue and fold to one side so you have a triangular pocket to pour your powder into (I'm not gonna suggest measures because I used to be a beast. Keep below 0.1g probably). Fold open end and swallow with a drink

Making a drug-wrap:

Fold a small piece of paper into an equal triangle and remove excess side if any. With the folded side on the bottom, fold right side 1/3rd into the middle, and left side 1/3rd into the middle and tucked into the opening of the right side. Fold the top of the triangle down to complete the square, and then fold the whole wrap in half horizontally so that the top flap folds behind your folded corners

Get a fannypack/bumbag:

It's so convenient having all your drugs in a designated space if you're out partying. You'll lose less shit

Learn the recovery position:

At some point you may have a friend who's a bit too wasted and just needs to sleep it off. Put your mind at ease, learn the recovery position and implement it. You could save a life

Upper comedowns: 

Hydrate, eat a banana, put on a Pixar movie and get as comfy as possible. Rest. You can buy 5HTP serotonin replacements in lots of health stores now

Chew gum on uppers if you have problems gurning, or suck a lollipop to distract the mouth altogether. Frozen grapes always make me happy too

Comeups from downers:

Drowsiness is what we're able to fight here. A spoon of honey or a sweet tea can really help with Ketamine confusion; gets the senses going

Know your waiting times before redosing:

Dont drop again thinking ""this isn't working"" within 3-4 hours on mushrooms and acid, 2-3 hours for pills (X) MDMA 2CB/2CI... (these being the ones people most commonly FU)

When tripping, remember you're on drugs, but try not to resist the affects; resistance makes for a bad trip

Increasing your high: 

Mdma: music. Not sure why you wouldn't have music playing, but music literally stimulates MDMA, it's science

Weed: Mangos. Mango juice or smoothies are bitching anyway but also help improve your buzz. More science for ya! 

When picking weed, pistils are whitest fresh, and brown and curl the more cbd builds up (strains colour respectively, judge accordingly) giving you a rough idea of thc/cbd ratio

Mushrooms: Like alcohol, don't eat other stuff. If you wanna sober up, eat. Science! 

Whippits: stop blowing back up that balloon, you're here for NOS, not CO2. Your balloon full of carbon dioxide will black you out with angry science

And always remember:

Safe and comfortable surroundings . Enjoy with mates you trust, a 'guru' if possible . No outside distractions. Good music . Plenty of drinking water to hand . Try not to climb up shit . Test your stimulants and downers . Know your plug . Don't drive intoxicated . Look after each other and dont push others beyond their limits . Give your body rest and watch your tolerance/habit . Be safe, and respect the risks that come with drugs . Enjoy responsibly

Yesterday, I lit up a j with some of my buddies thinking it's all gonna be chill and nice. This was new weed I'd never tried before, and as it turns out, we underestimated how much should go on a joint. It was really, really strong. At first it was alright and we kind of just melted into the couch, but after about half an hour, I started completely losing reality. I started talking to people that weren't there and I thought I could telepathically communicate with other people. I was hearing my bfs voice (he wasn't there) telling me that I need to come back. Then I heard a train going away and I felt I was transported to a beach with so many people around me talking to me. I haven't been this completely out of it in a long time.

Its noted that the combination of downers all together actually puts them in a state of energy and hypo-manic behaviors, with massively reduced need for sleep (but only during the times he takes this combination). Like they stay up all night but still dont crash yhe next day.

Why would the downers paradoxically make them an energetic insomniac and a hypo-manic?

I started smoking when I was 14 and didn’t stop until next summer (5 months). Getting high was great, it was normal like it was for everybody else. I stopped when I thought that it my smoking habit was too much and causing more harm than good in my life. 

I stopped  without relapsing. I was addicted so withdrawals was severe everlasting anxiety, headaches, social phobia which I have never experienced till then, strange paranoia and 3 panic attacks which all lasted for a month.

After a month I decided that I could start smoking again but keep it to only to special occasions. 

When I did get high getting high felt different, like worse. I can experience stuff like uncontrollable  fast  heart beat, to headaches/physical discomfort, to literally almost fainting(vision going white/cold sweat), to paranoia and to general anxiety. It varied time to time whenever I smoked, no matter what it was bad.

So what the fuck is happening to me. I imagine that underwent some psychological changes when I stopped or could it be something else. This still happens, I miss enjoying getting high, I’m the only mf that doesn’t smoke in my friend circle. 

Anybody else experience this/ know what the hell is going on, it’s been 4 years and I’m dying to know. I had no psychological issues before I started smoking.

Maybe these factors that apply to my life before and when I was smoking can help your answer: 

Psychological-
-(recently diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder after I quit smoking, recently diagnosed with ADHD this year. ) No past medication. Generally HAPPY Asf with one issue(girl problem)that I would let get to my head.

General life-
-outgoing until all this went down, started high school which was freaky. Kept a small circle of friends. Good grades, moderately happy family. Ig my outlook on life was mainly concentrated on relationships.

It’s basically dyslexia but colour based. The glasses should fix your reading problems and help with the many other problems that irlen syndrome can cause.

The situation I am in - Year and a half ago I acquired real pure MD. First few months took every three weeks. Always with multiple 250-300mg doses of NA-R-ALA for a day or two, Vit C and Magnesium L-Threonate to make sure I am not doing damage to the brain. Also, very modest dosing. 300-350mg max per session. 

Always positive afterglow and better life in general. Haven’t observed any bad sides except one - after not taking for 3-4 weeks after about an year of having the MD, suddenly I cant sleep peacefully. Wake up after 4-5 hours of sleep. This continues until I take again and the next 3 weeks I sleep like a baby again until again the same occurs. Already tried 3-4 times and now I am back to the same situation.

The feeling I get is the same but a bit weaker after I first decided to take 5-HTP after a roll “to help recovery”. The feeling of anxiety and nervousness, inability to sleep properly set in for whole two days. Tried 5-HTP again to verify this is the cause - again anxiety, social anxiety and nervousness that feels like my body is trembling a bit. Lasted about a day. 

Now, I feel as soon as Serotonin goes back up to normal , I get this same feeling I got from 5-HTP but in a more controlled manner. But it makes me unable to sleep properly. Still I function OK in society but this 4-5 hour of sleep max is making things hard.

I don’t want to take again just to go to sleep normally.
I ask you for suggestions what to do - wait until Serotonin receptors get down-regulated again ? Last time I waited for 1 month+ without proper sleep and it didnt help , so I just took to get back to normal. Can I take something to lower serotonin ?

I have tripped on lsd and mushrooms about 20 times in my life. I’ve only tripped 5 times since i have became anxious. 

First time was a gram of mushrooms and i was already anxious and it was discomforting. 

Second time was 1.5g of shrooms and i was 100% fine

Third time 2g of mushrooms and i was 100% fine 

Fourth time was 100ug of lsd and i was totally fine

Fifth time was 200ug of lsd and i smoked a joint as i was peaking and i was unbelievably overwhelmed and i was anxious i was going to be stuck like that and anxious that i couldn’t control my body and worried i would run around and do some whack shit and lose control over my body and sat still for 7 hours while i had an out of body experience

She is only an hour in and she is feeling nauseous; Is that normal? I didn’t have that. I think she chose a good environment she is just scared of the intensity of the peak. My peak was very intense and I have told her about it before (I was listening to a song called a little longing goes away by the books then in one part of the song my bed and walls started “melting” and my soul felt like it was vibrating out of my body and that was the most intense experience of the entire trip and my entire life) it was honestly life changing. I told her to just go with the flow of the trip and listen to calming music and just stay occupied. I’m just worried because I really care about her and I want her to have fun.

Now, since the 36mg was prescribed to me I had issues falling asleep so I was prescribed some benzos(gerodorm) at first, good enough but started losing efficiency pretty fast, it didnt help I was taking double the dose my doc recommended either(was doing this for the benzo high i got before going to sleep). Now, fast forward to Thursday, I visit my doc, he ups my concerta to 54 and also prescribes me Zopiclone to help with sleep because the new pills are stronger thus I need a stronger sleep aid. That night, I took 1 pill of Zopiclone alongside a beer, very big mistake. Why? Because I had 6 beers in the fridge and 30 pills of zopiclone. Now i have no idea how and why, but I blackedout soon after the first pill and woke up friday at around 6 pm with the biggest headache ever and with all 6 beers drunk as well as all the zopiclone pills missing, first i thought, hey maybe I hid them or I gave them away while spaced out? Nope I ate all of them, all 30. And I dont even know why I did that because there is no effect that I felt from those pills outside the blackout. Anyway, im safe after that but I was left very very depressed because of the withdrawal. I didnt take the new concerta pill in neither days so yesterday I decided after an intense googling session that it would be a good idea to swallow 3x54mg concerta pills to up my mood. Good overall experience, untill it came down and made me anxious as fuck making me unable to fall asleep, managed to in the end, even only if for 5 hours but hey, cant complain, did it myself. Now my question is, because more than sure my tolerance is through the roof right now, should I just take the 54mg today as usual or should I do a break? And, note that before rushing in and saying that I should contact my doctor and not ask strangers on the internet, that is not possible as my clinic refuses to give me my own doctors phone number even after I told them what happened with the zopiclone.

I know at this point im dependent and heading towards bad seas as I keep increasing everything.  The last 3 days just seem like one long fever dream of confusion and production. So I wanted to atleast jot down what I remember for anyone who's bored enough to read this lol.  (And damn sorry this is so long)


I've had a high tolerance for a very long time and have recently crushed my addy and try to take it orally as I dont like snorting it too much anymore. Tums also slowly became a more common thing to do so I can potinate it more ( which just throws my tolerance to stupid high levels over time)

Got my refill of 60 after I have been off for 2 days, which actually hit me hard on day 2. After I got home I pretty much figured I got nothing to do so might as well crush some powder, make music and chill. I dont even feel my 20mg anymore so I reached for another one shortly after. I had tums in my stomach for half and hour prior to get the most.  Repeat, and find another small thing to focus on. Buy 3am I figured I'll just keep going and find 42 different things to do to feel productive because I subconsciously feel bad about how I cant do any of that sober. 

Sun comes up, I'm writing lyrics after hours which felt like minutes,  and  did absolutely everything and nothing the whole night. So during the day I did minimum work with errands as depression has been a cloud over the head for the last 4 years. Try to drink, eat, recover etc. almost at this part of my life am more awake naturally, even without drugs, at 3 or 4 am than any other time.  

Sundown, day 2: My brain automatically feels trained to know it's time to get my artificial happyness and interest. Some pavlov stuff honestly. I figured the second night I'd say fuck it and take whatever I want, some reason I didnt care and just let myself cave into 4 or 5 pills, doing misc stuff, and I'm using my tuner that I had my new record player setup, wires, with the preamp.

I might just cut it off there because I havent had any addy for almost 24 hours and I'm still pumped and I know I'm not the most articulate person.  I can finish it if anyone actually wants to hear the rest.

TLDR: I just wanted to talk to someone or just feel noticed. This is just half of pretty boring writing but also wanted to let everyone know I love this community and I'm always open to talk. (btw if anyone was curious about my direction and fact of letting myself numb the receptors for natural happyness, I'm seeing some docs Monday:)  this is basically the final thing that tipped the iceberg for me to snap out of it and not watch myself fall down anymore

So Im getting high on speed(amp) cuz it motivates me to do stuff i wanna do. I realize im so horny so i look up hookers n the internet. Found one, so I decided drive to this city about 30 mins away from me(so stupid to drive high, especially when tweaking out).

I get there and its a straight bad vibe. I could smell the desperation from both of us in the room, a sad site. She didn't seem into it and i just wanted to leave , i ask if i could and she said 'you've paid now so you cant'. Queue the worst sex of my life for a lot of reasons im sure you can probably guess.

Anyway drove home super fast like i didnt give a fuck about the value of my life, speeding crazy and not slowing down when there was a steep turn, that kinda thing. I go home and carry snorting speed and taking sedatives to numb the pain.

&amp;#x200B;

what i did was reckless, i defied lockdown rules, drove when i was tweaking out and that  is totally reckless,irresponsible and wrong, so im sorry to anyone i potentially put  at risk. I have promised never to do that again

Since February of 2020 I microdosed quite a few times and had two decent trips in combinaton with weed, and honestly I cant believe the changes in many aspects of my life. During these trips I realized I made these unwanted ""parts"" of myself a restriction for my own potential, my own growth, my social circle, my behaviours and I did it for years. I didnt necessarily blame others for my shortcomings but I blamed my complacency on my upbringing and I never ever got in touch with myself to the point where I felt comfortable in my own skin or with my own personality. 

There are several ways in which acid has helped me on my journey of self discovery:

I have gotten exceptionally tidy because I learned that in order to thrive I need a clean safe space to call my own, and how I treat that space is a reflection of how I treat myself. My room is decorated exactly how I want it to be and the most messy it'll ever get is if I leave some clothes on the floor overnight or leave a plate on my desk for a few hours. Every item, clothing or furniture has its own place in my little world and its comforting to me. Keeping order around me means its easier to keep order inside me.

I realized why I am so exceptionally needing of security and belonging; I now know I need to strengthen the belief I have in myself and let myself be the anchor, instead of making other people my sole purpose in life. I picked up some tricks on how I work on this while watching The Midnight Gospel a few weeks ago, I highly reccommend it. What Ive been doing this far is to allow myself to truly reflect and realize my acconplishments and my good traits, to let myself know that Im on the right path and that I am able to carry my own strength. 

I now meet people with a newfound degree of compassion, empathy and with a desire to listen and learn instead of being the centre of attention. I have felt how individual humans are dying beacons on a plane permanently searching for meaning, not realizing and not knowing that our strings of consciousness unite us and means we collectively are searching for the same things, and that by strengthening these floating bonds we are grounding ourselves into our own existence. 

I have never been this close to being comfortable with my own sexuality. I havent had sex in 3 months and it feels absolutely amazing. This whole ordeal started more as an act of spite after a break up but as the weeks went by I learned that my urges for attention and validation needed to be adressed in a different manner. On monday I am traveling to meet a guy Ive been talking to for a while so thats where the streak ends but I can say with full confidence it'll be purely out of love and passion, not as a desperate cry for control or to fill a void. 

I find the most ironic thing to be that I went to a psychologist for two sessions for some potential diagnoses but she had to end my sessions as I hadnt been sober the last months before I was there (mdma on new years, some weed and one lsd microdose at that point) and in such a short time I feel like I am finally true to myself and that I couldnt have accomplished this with a psychologist alone anyway.

I need some advice and I know I can count on Reddit !
My doc just switched my prescription from 50mg tramadols to 200mg controlled release tablets (zytram XL in Canada)
I took 2 and it only maintains (barely) my withdrawal symptoms. I used to take 250mg one shot and then a couple more throughout the day to maintain a high I could feel. I think I could take up to maybe 500-600mg I’m guessing (maybe more) throughout the day with no seizures or nausea etc. 
Now I have no idea what to do to be safe with these slow release caps. If I take 3 slow release at once (600mg) will I be ok? I don’t think crushing them or putting them in water is taking away the slow release aspect of it because I tried with a 200mg tab and felt almost nothing. If I didn’t have bad side effects on 5-600mg with IR tabs will something bad happen if I take the slow release ?

I am a 30yr old male that’s never struggled with addiction but has definitely experimented with various drugs through the years. 
Up until last night I have tried shrooms about 6 times. Every experience has been positive, indoors and drinking wine. All beautiful, fun, blissful experiences like feeling cradled by pure love.

Last night my girlfriend and I decided to go out for some food and drinks but the night was cut short because she was on her period and just wanted to go home. This made me feel a little annoyed because I wanted to stay out some more. So we went home, started watching a show and I decided to eat a mushroom to liven up the Friday night. Again, the visuals and that feeling of bliss came over me and I was back in a fun, relaxed state of mind. I take another mushroom about 15mins later.

Time passes, I’m feeling good and we then decide to go to sleep. Still feeling happy but now disoriented, we head to bed. She turns off the bedroom light and I start getting into a very intense trip. Not being able to relax, I toss and turn and I start losing all control of my thoughts, I am “bouncing off the walls” and feeling uneasy. Then things get really strange.
 
The visuals are getting stronger and stronger, I lose grip on reality and who I am. I feel like I’m turning into different people. At one point I was a Mexican man (I even had the taste of tacos in my mouth), then a black guy, and then a gay black guy! Imagine how a gay black guy would act in movies, that’s how I felt. And I’m none of those three.

I start seeing these figures that are in some way telling me to throw up in order to get these mushrooms out of my system because the trip is about to get worst, like a warning almost. But I hate vomiting so I try everything I can not to. Still tossing and turning, my thoughts now turn very dark. I’m terrified to the point where I feel as if I had awakened some deep areas of my consciousness that should have never been awakened. I’m thinking maybe I had jumpstarted some schizophrenia , paranoias, or dementia in me and am now going to be stuck this way forever. In my head I start replaying conversations with different people in my life about how it was my fault that I went crazy because I took this large dose of mushroom. Have I completely lost my mind? Am I going to have to check into an insane asylum? I’ll never be able to work again, my friends and family will all be heartbroken and so disappointed in me! I’ll never be able to get out of this mental loop! I’ll never be the same again!

These thoughts become very intense and I’m panicking to the point where I wake my girlfriend up and tell her that I need to talk so that she could help calm me down. My head is in my palms and I just say, “something doesn’t feel right”, “I don’t know”. I feel like crying but I can’t. She tell me to just breath, relax and drink some water. 

I head to the bathroom so disorientated and start turning lights on along the way, (girlfriend gets annoyed because of this and it makes me feel shitier). I’m trying to induce vomiting but nothing is working. I don’t feel myself anymore and now feel completely insane. I’m scared shitless that I might end up like this forever and that I might need some medical attention. I’m having a mental breakdown.

I decide to lay on the couch because I’m comfortable there and start feeling a little better but still can’t relax. Then I get even more terrified because I start thinking that maybe im feeling this way because the world is ending, not physically but the entire human collective consciousness is coming to an end. I start making connections with everything happening in the world today, the full moon and it being the year 2020 that this might just be the end of human consciousness. As if it were judgment day and “aliens” or “entities have decided our time is up on this earth and its time to come home or put an end to all “thinking”. 

I try to shake those thoughts by thinking of other things and for some reason scrolling through my phone aimlessly helps calm me down. I begin feeling sleepy now and I am slowly starting to grasp my thoughts again. I’m calmer now and head back to my bedroom. I drink some more water, lay down in bed, hug my girlfriend and slowly drift back into a deep sleep. 

I woke up this morning in complete awe of what the hell happened last night, still a little uneasy. I feel back to normal now but I’m still trying to process why I felt that and if I should ever even do shrooms again because I would hate to ever feel that again. Shroom’s have came into my life around December and have become a new found love for me to the point where I learned how to successfully grow my own. It’s been such a positive experience so far but last night was just too much and has me questioning what it all means. 

Could it have been a bad mushroom? Or maybe me being annoyed earlier that set the base for a bad trip? I also did a lot MDMA a couple weeks back that I somehow still feel here and there, could low serotonin levels maybe caused this? I don’t know how I went from beautiful, blissful, psychedelic experiences to whatever last night was.

If anyone could please help me understand what could have happened or give me some insight into what maybe caused this “bad trip” I would seriously, greatly appreciate it!

Today I woke feeling normal, considering the circumstances. However after being awake for a few hours I jumped in the shower. I started feeling short of breath and feeling faint. This really spooked me.

I took 2g of shrooms and I guess I’m really sensitive to them or they are really strong but it was very intense.

I always wondered how a bad trip would be bad. But then I understood. It was literally torture. 10x worst then the worst thing I’ve previously experienced. Basically for 2 hours, I was extremely restless and uncomfortable, and my mind was in shambles. I couldn’t distract myself from anything. I was in a though loop of checking Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, to distract myself from the uncomfortableness but everytime I pulled up a vid or some to watch it made me more uncomfortable. No matter what I did, I felt like shit. It was a torturous trap, but what really made it hell was im not lying when I say 1 minute felt like 15 mins. Not exaggerating. I would have a whole existential thought regarding my whole life and only see a minute go by. It was so bad I literally was walking circles in my room banging my head on the wall. At this point in the trip everything in my room looked like one big cartoon swirl and my whole room was waving. Way more intense visuals then what I had on acid. The closed eyes visuals were so intense I was scared to even look at them, but now I wish I did.

I got past this for 2 hours. There were times throughout the trip I had very deep thoughts that I can hardly explain or recall. One point where I had almost an out of body experience.

The new perspective on life that I had that night can’t even really be explained but it was very magical.

People aren’t lying when they say mushrooms guide you. Slowly and slowly as I calmed down, specifically when I started msging someone on reddit, my trip slowly started turning good.

By the end of it I was balling my eyes out with the feeling of more love my what I have and the people I know then I have ever had in my life.

I regretted all the stupid things I’ve done in my life that pushed away the people that really mattered, and the drugs I did to cope with my lack of happiness.

I wanted nothing more then to just live. I just wanted to be normal again and hug my family. 

I sincerely think shrooms have changed my life for the better. Even tho I had a horror of a trip I’m glad I went through it. Only thing I wish is that I brought back everything with me as there was many hectic things that happened that I’m struggling to fully recall.

She has experience with all types of substances, studies medicine and she has no reason to be dishonest. Has not had any type of benzo/opiate/stimulant in months prior. In recent weeks only a couple glasses of wine, insignificant amount of weed and her first experience with mushrooms.

She is diagnosed with Borderline, PTSD and Antisocial personality disorder but doesn't medicate against either. Over-counter acid reflux/motion sickness pills PRN, that's it.

I am an experienced user of mdma, but I have never tried taking a pill before. Today I purchased two pills from a friend and wanted to enjoy the night with my buddies.

I took the first pull hours ago. Since I didn't feel anything, I opted for the second one half an hour ago. Still no significant effect. I can tell that there is some effect, since peeing is difficult as usual, but other than that I am not feeling the euphoric experience I have tried so many times before with crystals.

My question:
Do pills usually take longer before kicking in? Usually I will mix the crystals in water and wait for an hour or so.

I am currently undertaking a research project to ascertain the street value of what I would call diverted medications, i.e. drugs that are legitimately utilised within the medical field, but which can/are sold illicitly.  My research project is attempting to follow the Portugese model, to treat alll drug usage as a purely medical issue, by providing it under the supervision of medical professionals, addicts can then be assured of purity, safety and in turn, hopefully optimize harm reduction and by extension, break the market for the pushers, and also reduce crimes committed by those under the influence of said addictions.

Oramorph, for example, is often used for pallitative care, and severe pain management where other analgesics have proven to be ineffectual in managing breakthrough of pain.

Oramorph Oral Solution 10 mg/5 ml: 100 ml bottle, what would be the street value of that  in UK/US/AUS?

Morphine sulfate tablets, 10 mg (Zomorph) what would be the street value of that in UK/US/AUS?

My thinking is this: treat the war on drugs as nothing more than a business, and economics.

I used to do almost extensive research regarding them due to the all around interest I took in obtaining drug knowledge.

(Don't take this the wrong way. I'm fully aware that I don't know everything, though I find the topic unusually fascinating)

I'm extremely careful over getting real, legitimately tested acid, and aware over the necessary preparations for the drug.

A friend of mine occasionally trips out on it, and sells the drug whenever he needs the money for something essential.

He very recently made a deal with me that for my first time, he'll either cut a 200ug tab into 4 tiny pieces (equating to 50ug each), OR he may cut a 150ug one into half that way I'd have two 75ug doses.

Although I felt confident about my decision, I have a few questions wondering if my frequent obsessions may ruin the trip.

To begin with, I was planning on accomplishing some of my goals before doing it so that I wouldn't feel so awful about slacking off.
Unfortunately, the quarantine hindered my chance to get my shit together.

Considering a lot of people are currently in the same boat,  I've been calming down over my procrastination and made the decision to try LSD before accomplishing anything to use the quarantine's limitations to my benefit.

Regardless of feeling a lot better over slacking off due to the circumstances, wouldn't LSD oftentimes shove this kind if thing in somebody's face? Or wouldn't most people enjoy the moment too much to care?

Also, aren't people MORE LIKELY to care too much on LSD or shrooms?

This kind of thing probably depends on the person or other factors, though I assumed it wouldn't hurt to ask.

Also, lately my mood has been shifting between feeling quite happy/perfectly fine and extremely curious, 

and obsessing over specific fears of mine regarding adequacy and self-worth.

If I worry about my competence level in specific areas, could this trip literally tell me how stupid I am while shoving it down my throat?

I already started to feel effects 5 minutes later, after 10 minutes I layed down because I felt heavy and disoriented.

A friend who was with me gave me water, I spilled it over her bed. I got another glass and spilled it again. At this point I began to feel more and more unwell and decided to go outside.

I wandered outside for a short while and wanted to return. I walked to the house but was unable to find the doorbell sign. I began to panick thinking maybe she put it of to get rid of me. My phone wasn't in my pocket anymore so I was unable to call so I rang a random bell and was let inside.

At this point, I began to forget what exactly I was doing. I asked were *insert name* was and was asked where I lived. I told him my adress(a city next to berlin) and he showed me the way to get there on his phone. I asked how I should get there without a phone, and he said he could help me by calling the police.

I panicked again said no thanks and went outside. This is when ego dissolusion set in. I was walking through the city terrified and not knowing what to do.

I asked a random woman who and where I was and told here I needed help but was unable to communicate the problem. I thought I had somehow died or was in a alternate reality and wanted to get the fuck out. She stared at me asking me questions but it lead to nothing. The last thing she said was ""Are you on a bad trip or something?""

I panicked again wondering how she could now something I had forgot up to this point.

I walked around, the visuals were insane. I started to fade out of reality, everytime I was nearly ""gone"" I felt this incredible euophoria, and I thought that Math was the underlying aswer to everything.

I thought I had to die to forever be in this comfortable space of nothingness, and tried to get run over by a car which luckily didn't work because of me walking to slow and being afraid of the loud sounds they made.

I kept walking and saw a van parking. I stopped moving and the car stopped too, I started to walk again and the car started too. This went on for a bit untill I ran away in terror.

After my memory cleared up, I had no idea were I was and how to get back. I didn't have my jacket or phone, and was near some train station. I saw a group of three walking in front of me and wanted to ask them were I wanted to go, but couldn't remember the street name. Some girl said ""Wtf this is like a bad horror movie, let's go"" and a friend of here came back(obviously on MDMA) came back and asked for a cigarette.

I walked around aimlessly and met them again, this time I was able to ask for the way. The MDMA guy told me ""It's ok I was deducted once too"" at this time I realised maybe my phone and jacket really was stolen, even though I couldn't remember.

The walk back was pretty short(I was told 2min, felt like 15).

When I was there, once again I couldn't find the fucking doorbell. That's when I realised I was next to the house I wanted to go.

So I went to the correct adress and rang the bell. Nothing. I began to panick and through my fists against the wall a few time, crying and screaming.

I screamed the name of my friend on the street and at some point I was let in. My phone and jacket were still there, it was now 2AM.

this week i havent took any and probably will let my brain heal itself a little bit.

LSD and other lysergamides, helped my a lot to become a better person. They also were my first love, no other high was even comparable to the things I learned through psychedelics.

However, like so many, I overdid it with psychedelics, empathogens, dissociatives etc. and got a mild case of HPPD (symptoms) in the first half of 2018. It scared the living shit out of me, haven't revisited psychs (aside from a few low dose mushroom trips in late 2019) since then.

Symptoms largely subsided since then, but the underlying fear of HPPD still persists to this day. I would love to revisit lysergamides and tryptamines someday again.

Is it more likely for HPPD symptoms to emerge again for anyone who already had them in the past?
I would greatly decrease my dosages and frequency and increase awareness, but a little underlying fear still persists.

Has anyone with subsided HPPD symptoms revisited psychedelics and detail some experiences and tips?

After 1 month I tapered down to 0.7mg of the subsolv brand (had no problem with this big taper) which i have been stable on for 5 months. So: I have been on it for a total of 6 months.

My plan is to taper to 0.35mg and see if I am stable. This would be a 50% taper. If this is successful would I be able to attempt jumping off? Unless it would be smarter to fuller taper??

I want to get off of it it gives me headaches, makes me nauseous, I feel trapped and wake up every morning with restless legs and mild withdraw.

 I’m not living in an area with possibility of relapse. Im not really worried about that, I have a counselor at my suboxone clinic, I see a psychiatrist once a week, I got to a NA meeting once a week, and have a wonderful support system with my friends, boyfriend, and family.

I am completely set with non habit forming comfort medications (promethazine, clonidine, aleve, marijuana). 

What will the timeline of jumping off take? How long will I have to deal with this?

Should I lower from 0.35mg before jumping off?

I know I was lonely, anxious, maybe a little sad. But I still don’t know what ultimately pushed me to do drugs. I guess I trusted the wrong people back then because I felt I had no one to trust. But that is the past, that was 4 years ago, so frankly, the “Why” doesn’t matter anymore.

For backstory, I started weed at 14, I wasn’t initially hooked, I didn’t think about it all that often, I didn’t really care for it to be honest. It was just something I did on occasion with my “friends” when we were bored and had some money. Summer of freshman year I drank, A LOT. Whole bottles of whiskey, vodka, tequila, box wine, bottled wine. I didn’t realize it in the moment, but I was only hurting myself mentally and physically, slowly but surely. I still never felt the NEED to do it. It was still something I just did for “fun”.

Fast forward a year, I’m arrested and sentenced to 1 year probation at 15. I was smart enough to know smoking weed wouldn’t be an option because of drug tests from my P.O. But for some odd reason I decided to use pills for “fun” while bored on probation. Not knowing that pills would show up too. I was a pill popper, for months, adderall, vyvanse, clonazepam, oxytocin. But even then, I felt I never needed it. It was purely for “fun”. 

After probation ended, the following 2 years of school (junior, senior year) were just a blur. Weed on the daily, alcohol whenever I could get it, pills if neither of those were available. The occasional but semi-frequent tab if acid... It took me almost 4 years to realize I had a problem. And maybe it wasn’t always a problem. But with lack of self discipline, I MADE it a problem.

Countless brain fried weed nights and acid trips, countless black out drunk nights that I don’t remember, more pills than I can imagine, a suicide attempt and a handful of failed sobriety attempts and here I am. 7am on a Saturday. I drank last night, I work in a few hours. I feel off, I feel wrong, I feel ashamed, dirty, deceived, mad, upset. I know I have a problem I HAVE KNOWN THIS FOR TOO LONG. But still, every time I think of weed, alcohol, it makes me happy. It makes me happy because I only remember the good times when I was on drugs, never the bad. I don’t remember the nights I’ve been so fried, feeling like shit. The nights I said “This is it, you’re done, no more drugs” I only remember the calm before the storm, before it was a problem, before I realized it was a problem, I don’t know. Its like I forget I HAVE to get sober like how someone would forget their homework, or their earbuds. I put such little weight on sobriety, it just slips my mind like that. Then I’m left to the mind of a stoner, a druggie, and alcoholic. 

I know I have it in me to become and stay sober, I know I have a sober mindset within me. But its a matter of choice and sacrifice. Wether I want to go through the struggle. I can keep struggling everyday of my life with drugs, or struggle A LOT, just for a bit, to then be able to enjoy a more fulfilling life whilst sober.

His grandson about 25yo then came and asked me for some - I said no as I didn't have enough and fiance needed them as he hates smoking. 

Let's called old guy A and grandson Z.

So I get a knock on the door about 45 mins later - fiance answers.  ""[fiance] what the fuck did you put in that cake you gave to Z?"" Z's grown ass girlfriend is sitting there in an accusatory tone like he's been given heroin lmao, his MOTHER is sat there too like 😡

Bear in mind I explicitly said I wasn't giving him any, so A has obviously given him half.

Well apparently Z passed out with a bottle in his hand, went pale, 'green' and then spent an hour in a toilet greening out to fuck.  Apparently he cut his face a little on the way down and went to hospital too (he is fine lol).  The fact he was holding a glass bottle makes me suspect he was drunk too lol. 

His gf was really sat there like we poisoned him haha it took me ages to realise who she was talking about.  She was totally defused when I explained I even told him not to eat it and just sort of went ""oh fair enough"" and left hahaha.  

Wish A hadn't shared it,  Z DOESN'T EVEN SMOKE WEED NEVER MIND A CHUNK OF SUPER STRONG BROWNIE.  ONLY lucky thing is that Z had actually asked for a full one when I gave it to A and I said no.

Tried to sober down with all the tricks I looked up. Snacks, lots of water, cold shower.. nada. I was high for the entire day and only felt somewhat normal the next day. But even after that, I didn't really feel right for a long time after this experience.

I can only describe it as a breakdown of reality. The world became very abstract..flat.

It's like getting a glimpse of the source code behind life and it scared me out of my mind.

Nothing felt real.

I had to pour water on my body at some point so I could hold onto wetness. I couldn't listen to music or watch YouTube because I felt I was being sucked into their space.

Reality was flat and everything was values and dimensions.

To be clear I didn't hallucinate. Visually everything stayed the same but my cognition of the things I felt made it seem less real. 

The best analogy is like seeing a photograph of a location, and knowing that though the picture looks life like it's not real in the screen...that is you can't enter it.

I felt that way about reality, up to an extent. Like the World was a 3D photograph and I was simply moving through it.

It was real bad guys. The worst is thinking it'll go on forever, I even tried to sleep but would start thinking about too many things in the darks.

At a certain point I started to understand how our brains accessed information like memory and language.

I was freakishly aware of the subconscious processes our brains go through.

At some point I had to just remind myself to breath. I was losing grip on reality and had to think about memories to remember the things I valued.

I finally understood how people get psychotic breaks and why governments are worried about psychoactive drugs. 

The panic can be unbearable when you think of the trip not passing and my heart was racing.

I had to repeat who I wanted to be to myself and I kept thinking ""I choose love. I choose curiosity.""

The feeling passed after a few hours and though I still felt the memory of abstraction I started to become more immersed in the photograph of reality.

I still don't know what I took, but I'm not taking it again.

What I've taken from it is that some drugs can be very dangerous for the unprepared, its not something to play with.

- Always know with certainty what you're taking.
- Always stay calm and believe you can handle the experience. Don't panic.
- Our perception of reality is very fragile and very narrow. 

That narrowness allows us to focus on the day to day rather than the second by second and keeps us from madness.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,683604,public,confidence,self,Had the worst trip ever yesterday,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gxo5hv/had_the_worst_trip_ever_yesterday/,no_ads,0.0,1591465980.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have found amphetemines to be slightly better although not good. 

Alcohol believe it or not actually makes me feel much better but its not socially acceptable and being halfcut to feel awake is certainly a road to ruin. Had two hours sleep, couple of beers and mood improved headache gone and energy levels up.

I was thinking modafinil or something similar. Just want to not have lethargy after two hours sleep. A focused brain and no horrible nausea, anxiety and  concentration levels at an acceptable level.

Combined with not being able to feel your face and being stimmed out of your head, it’s the icing on top of the cake. But please be careful.

I got addicted to cocaine when I was 17 years old and did 1g+ a day for around 2-3 years. I was constantly snorting lines, and constantly gumming it. Fast forward to now (I’m 20 and 1 and a half years clean) and my entire top and bottom rows of teeth has developed holes on the front, back, and bottom. To put it in perspective, 28 of my 32 teeth have multiple cavities, mainly right on the gum line. Quitting cocaine was tough on its own, but the irreparable damage that gumming did to my gums and teeth is already done. My front teeth have been semi-fixed after about $8000 in dental work, but that’s just from fixing the worst and most visible cavities. To fully repair my mouth I’m looking at about $20,000 in dental costs and at this point I don’t even know if it’s worth it. It killed my self-esteem, and I’m just now finally learning how to smile with my teeth.

So I’m 19 now and i’ve been doing psychedelics since I was 16. Just acid and shrooms. When I was 17, I had 2 experiences I can’t really understand to this day. 

I had done LSD multiple times before this occasion and one good day I decided I would like to take an LSD trip. I pick up the tabs from a good friend who i’ve always bought my psychedelics from. I had never tested my tabs in the past and they all felt very clean so I expected this time around to be the same. I decided to trip alone which I have done before and never had a problem. I bought 2 tabs and they were just white blotter papers. I took one and waited, didn’t notice any bitter taste on the tab. It kicked in about an hour after taking it if I can remember correctly. Up to this point, I had tripped multiple time but never took more than one tab. I noticed very quickly the high intensity of my trip. I was extremely overstimulated and it felt as if the aura of the room changed with my overall emotion. If i felt slightly cold the room would turn blue and dark and then i turned on my heater and there was an orange tone to the room. All of it felt much much stronger than anything I had ever experienced and felt different and more synthetic in a way. Eventually it got to the point where i was very overstimulated and I decided it would be best if i tried to close my eyes and turn off the light to try to calm down. It was working very well for a little while, but then I heard something in the distance. The sonic theme song playing very quickly. At the peak of the chorus of the song a long pixilated digital snake type thing came at me in sync with the sonic theme song from the corner of my room. It smashed in my face and i was blinded by flashing neon lights and digital flashing pixilated images all being synced to the sonic theme song. I snapped myself out of that somehow and literally just thought to myself wtffffff. I then tried to sleep and starting thinking about the movie IT and visualized Pennywise eating my head. Somehow by the grace of God i fell asleep and woke up the next day feeling dead asf.

Fast forward to my lunch table at school. I tell my friends about this experience and they are also very experienced with psychedelics. They tell me I just had a bad trip and there was no way it could’ve been laced to with anything. I tried to explain to them i was hallucinating things i’ve never seen on acid but they didn’t seem to think anything otherwise, so I believed them and convinced myself I had just had a bad trip. 

Fast forward to months and months later because i took a psychedelic break after this bad trip experience. I had a good friend who wanted to do LSD together for the first time. We planned our trip and i hit up my same dealer and he gave me 2 tabs and i told her i had a 3rd tab saved from my last trip just incase we didn’t trip hard enough and wanted to. So we both took a tab of the new acid and it felt completely normal. We were having a great time and everything was perfect. A couple hours into our trip once it was late we decided of course decided to split the last tab. We did that, and then decided to take some dabs. (Ive never not smoked weed or wax on a trip so that doesn’t really have much to do with it i don’t think). Immediately I could tell a difference in the trip. It felt more synthetic again and the room was extremely cartoony and i was seeing designs and decorations that weren’t really there and the plain walls were making rainbow like colors it was crazy. The whole damn room literally looked like an entire cartoon with cartoon designs being flashed all over the walls. I remember at one point my friend said this isn’t what acid usually feels like. I agreed but we tried to keep moving. We tried to listen to some music but it just made us felt anxious. We watched moana and it literally kinda felt like a horror movie no cap. Eventually we were both so overstimulated and our hearts were racing and we wanted to sleep but we couldn’t. We held hands until we fell into a half sleep and came out of it. Also the visuals were also extremely geometric. It was pretty strange. That trip ended up being good but in the end it was very intense and extremely uncomfortable. Still to this day I’m not really sure. Ive tripped acid multiple times since then and never had that same experience from that batch. It was crazy and something i had never seen in my life hallucination wise.

Summary: I took presumably some sort of fake acid and had a scary time, told my friends and they convinced me i had a bad trip and it wasn’t laced and i believed them and took the same batch with a friend at another time and had a pretty similar experience to the first",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,683564,public,confidence,self,Did I do nbombe rather than LSD?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gxlspt/did_i_do_nbombe_rather_than_lsd/,no_ads,0.0,1591453506.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Legally because of the record the law can do nothing. Small claims court won't take this. I have a witness messaging him telling him I owe him that amount of money, but he is trying to lie and manipulate me that I owe him 20 pounds.
This man is so insane that he is lying he has a job when he turned around and said the job centre struck him off because he is insane.
The only thing I could think to resort to is to post the evidence on his Facebook for all to see, but because I snapped and demanded my money back he has blocked me (apparently only people that cater to your laziness and be lovely about it get their money back 😂)

I dont like taking pills to help me sleep cause my family suffers with addictive personalities and I'm worried pills would be a slippery slope for me. Another reason I liked to smoke before bed is because it would keep my nightmares away (one reason it was hard for me to get a full night's rest, I would be stuck in repeat nightmare and if I did manage to wake up I wouldn't want to fall back asleep) When I smoke weed I don't dream, so I dont have those nightmares. Also when I smoked I never suffered from sleep paralysis (another reason I dont like to fall asleep ever since I woke up and couldn't move in the middle of the night with my face almost fully in my pillow, making it feel like I was suffocating myself) I know this post is getting kinda long but I can no longer smoke so I'm wondering if anyone else has any of these problems and how they deal with them.

More often at 17 at then quite a lot at 18 but still a lot of breaks. Always low tolerance.

Most of the time I had anxiety while smoking but it was just my normal state amplified.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I dont even get anxious anymore, maybe sometimes but sometimes I feel even less anxiosu while high than I would sober. Normally its just the same.

&amp;#x200B;

I have ADHD and bipolar and im not on meds but weed really makes my head calm and works almost as good as adderrall. Not quite but good enough allowing me to focus.

Main thing is weed to me is incredibly psychedelic. And having adhd my thoughts are racing all the time, and when I smoke depending on strain my thoughts race more but it makes the fog go away.

&amp;#x200B;

Weed gives me a different perspective about my problems, goals, life. Feels like I am looking life throught different lens thats not possible when sober. I think really negative thoughts too and weed helps a lot with that and makes me solve issues like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I abused drugs before, mainly benzos because they calmed my thoughts and made me feel good/numb. I been clean for a while now only using occasionally, I have no cravings.

&amp;#x200B;

When I have weed i have no cravings to other drugs and no need at all to get any. Maybe sometimes I might drink a beer or two or take adhd pills, not abusing every once in a while.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts? Has weed helped with your life? I feel like it helps a lot with my depression and anxiety im still not sure. But feel like positives really outweight negatives with it.. 

Also allows me to eat more which I struggle with and im trying to work out so weed helps with that.

'

I would only smoke every night, maybe 2 times a day sometimes. You think its a good idea to try?

Because when I smoke I only buy small amounts i have never tried to actually use it as a tool and use it every day and see how it helps really.

I ate too much cannibutter and had a trip not too un-similar to shrooms.(Ive only tried shrooms once.)

I had ""visuals"" but as real seeming as lsd or shrooms, I was aware everything I was visualizing was just my imagination.  anyway I saw a cartoon representation of my soul fighting and struggling to come into this world. There was a tunnel straight upwards and void bellow. I kept climbing and struggling but after every once i crossed, there was another hurdle and I was aware that if I stopped my struggle I would be pulled back down into nothingness. I somehow finally made it out and was suddenly stuck in place in a grey void. I tried to move and call out but I was trapped. I was trying to flail to see if there was literally anything else but there wasn't. I have never ""felt"" such unimaginable dread and terror than right then. I put felt in quotations because it was more like a feeling of empathy. I knew I was just laying in my bed. After that my soul started screaming and the entire grey place turned into this kafkaesque patter of screaming faces. Somehow that fell away and I was left again in a black void staring upwards trying to communicate again and justify or confirm my own existence. but there was just this slate grey cube. The cube eventually turned into two of my mom's face next to each-other. I was screaming and wondering if i was alive but my mom's face just stared through me. After that I kinda came out of these visualizations. It was truly a weird experience. I feel like I got the diet version of an actual bad trip. What do you guys make of this?

So. I smoked basically all day every day all through college. So like almost 5 years of being high nonstop. It was my first thing to do in the morning and my last thing to do at night. Eventually my tolerance was so high I barely felt anything no matter how much I smoked and when I WAS sober I would be anxious and restless and achy. Which smoking more weed did not relieve (it almost made it worse). 

Clearly this was not healthy lmao. 

So I’ve been taking a lot of breaks and learning to use weed in moderation. First, I went cold turkey from it for a couple of months. It was awful the first week or so, but by two months I hardly ever thought about it anymore. 

So with my tolerance reset, I bought a G and it lasted me like a whole week with my one-hitter and once again weed felt fucking great. 

However, I noticed that if I kept smoking every day, it stopped feeling good and started feeling bad again. So I took another break. 3-4 weeks later, another G of bud. Smoked it for like a week, took another break, etc etc...

I have fallen into an impromptu rhythm based entirely on how the smoking makes me feel. I can smoke every day for like a week or two weeks and have fun, but once it starts not being fun, I stop. I don’t have any particular length of time in mind for my breaks, but naturally I go about a month before I truly crave weed again and buy a little (never more than 2 grams). 

I’m pretty content with this? It’s so much more enjoyable than constant smoking was. That first hit when I haven’t had any in over a month is magical. 

Learning moderation with weed took a long time and it’s an ongoing process, but I truly feel that I have a much healthier relationship with it now than I did in college.

put it with less than a spoonful of butter on a candle (long story),

waited about 5-ish minutes. the butter bubbled a bit but i let it cool and it didn't bubble completely. Th butter looked darker and smelled strongly of hash.

mixed it with yogurt and it tasted much like hash

Backstory is that I have a younger cousin, he is 15 and I am 26. We were super close growing up and he was like a little brother to me until like 5 years back my crazy aunt (his mom) basically disbanded from the family. 

Well recently I found him on social media and we started chatting and catching up. I noticed he posted pics of him with weed to his Instagram so was like oh shit, he’s a little stoner! He mentioned weed to me in one of his messages and I am very open minded and easy going so I basically just told him to be careful and have fun and he can always ask me for advice or talk to me if he thinks he’s in trouble. I want him to be honest with me because my aunt is a psycho totalitarian parent who is borderline abusive towards him and he needs stable supportive family. 

Well fast forward today, he FaceTimes me out of nowhere and I can tell he’s kind of fucked up. He tells me about how he is tripping balls on acid. I asked him if he was safe and feeling okay and he said yes. Long story short I saw some kids in the background that appeared doing lines of some sort of substance. He also had an Instagram post where he commented “high off that perk” so i also think he’s messed with opiates. 

I’m not drug naive and I’ve done every drug in the book but I was 19/20 and he JUST turned 15.
I have no idea how to handle this situation. I feel like everyone experiments in their teens but I just worry about him because I know his background and how awful his home life and he reminds me of friends I had back in high school who are dead now.

I was thinking about it whilst at a friends earlier, we're outside 4 of us and they all started smoking and I didn't because i've quit.

I remember thinking ""i'm not going to just stop hanging around with people because i've quit smoking, i'll just not smoke"". But I also remember thinking i'm not going through pshyical withdrawls randomly all the time like imagine if I walk past someone in the street smoking I can't help stuff like that.

Then we went inside and they were smoking like right next to me because the room is small and there isn't many places to be so, people were literally next to my face smoking cigs and I felt okayish but now later on some 10-12 hours later I am sweating a little, i'm moody, it feels like withdrawls. I'm tempted and it's annoying that I won't be able to sleep properly but i've given in about a zillion times and it never feels good so i've actually come a long way but.

It feels as if I can't be around smokers, ever. That or just deal with being pshyically annoyed randomly alot. Emotionally annoyed I can deal with, i've had that my whole life. But actually sweating and feeling sick in the stomach and not being able to sleep, craving drugs -- I cba with this shit.

I know that nicotine can play mind games on you to *convince* you that taking nicotine is actually a good thing, it becomes justifiable well if i've learned anything from that little voice it's that just because you can justify something doesn't make it the right thing to do and that is a strong statement to make justice is justice but that's how nicotine works. You could be in a hospital bed with only hours to live and nicotine will convince you that having a cig right now is a good idea, you only have a couple hours to live why not?

Couldn't be further from your own voice in my opinion, a very hard thing to comprehend.

My friends and I went camping in a really nice remote spot on a lake, and took shrooms the first day and molly the second.  We all dosed 150mg, and a ~30mg re-dose.  While I was on molly, I felt amazing.  I loved my friends, and I felt a deep sense of love for myself.  This stood out to me more, as I usually have fairly low self-esteem.  I even said to my friends, “Man I feel so good about myself.  I’m such great person to be around.  I’m just so happy to be me, ya know?”  This sounds kind of narcissistic, but in reality I just hadn’t felt real love for myself for as long as I can remember and I wanted to express this.  I felt like the person I’d always aspired to be.  I was funny, caring, and knew exactly what to say at the right time. 

It’s been two days and this feeling has stuck with me.  Of course I’m not as extroverted as I was while on molly, but I feel almost as good about myself.

**Serious:**

* fluoxetine oral + amitriptyline oral
&gt; fluoxetine oral and amitriptyline oral both increase affecting serotonin levels in the blood. Too much serotonin is a potentially life-threatening situation. Severe signs and symptoms include high blood pressure and increased heart rate that lead to shock.

* fluoxetine oral + propranolol oral

&amp;#x200B;

My father has a long list of health problems over the past 20 or so years. Mostly these are pain related, as when he was younger he broke a lot of things and had a few concussions. He's had surgery on his neck, foot and also has a spinal stimulator though that has not exactly done a whole lot for him. He also used to have a drug abuse problem, and for the past year or so he's been on suboxone. I know that you can't drink alcohol or take a lot of different drugs when on suboxone. From the start of the year though, he started taking ambien to help him sleep at night. From what I gather from Google, you're not supposed to take ambien and suboxone though. Whenever he would take it, he would act really weird. Say incoherent things, just stand around, put things in the microwave he shouldn't, eat A LOT, try to leave at like 10 PM to go to work, etc. I would always have to get him to go to bed, which sometimes was really difficult. After each time I'd tell him to please stop taking the ambien and he would apologize and stop for a little while. But he's done this again and again about 4-5 times now. A month ago though, he got more ambien and took some like really early (4PM\~ish) and started acting weird again. This time though, he would forget that he took some and would take more and more, in a cycle, and I didn't realize this was happening until like 1 AM and I took them away. He ended up getting really mad and was still completely out of it, before finally I was able to get him to sleep at like 3 AM. Again, he apologizes, says he doesn't remember, and says he'll stop. Now just the other day, he takes some again, this time though, my mom holds onto them so she can give him only the amount he needs to sleep. What happens though is that he kept trying to get more and more, looking for the pill bottle and getting upset but then acting dumb cuz he again, just completely out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I THINK he hasn't been taking them. But.... he still act... not normal? He just doesn't look right. Not necessarily incoherent, but just does weird things that he wouldn't do normally. I'm not sure if he has managed to get more, and is taking smaller dosages just to get high or what's going on. I should mention he takes a lot of different drugs for many reasons. He multiple things for blood pressure, stuff for cholesterol, suboxone, testosterone, stuff for shingles. Takes benadryl to help him sleep. He also takes 'natural' things like fish oil, l-theanine, GABA, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

So does anyone have thoughts on what's going on? Is he getting high? I know he's a life long addict... Or is just his age? A combination? I'm not sure and I'm just really worried about him...",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,683471,public,confidence,self,My 64 Year Old Father Takes Many Different Drugs and Has Recently Starting Acting..

It was a passion and I wanted to try different substances without hurting myself.


And one of the things I researched was how long certain substances will be detectable in your system for.


Overtime I kinda just learned, weed is typically detectable for 3 weeks to a month, things like Xanax is 2 weeks - 3 weeks, coke 1-3 days, mdma 2-4 days, etc.


But doing a little looking again, sites are now reporting way shorter detection periods. Healthline is even saying weed is only detectable for 3 days for occasional users. But as far as I know, that’s bullshit. No one I know, including myself, that was tested even 2 weeks after passed.


In high school I smoked a total of 5 times. And in the two times I had been tested, I showed up positive as long as 3 weeks after I smoked.


I remember reading the reason was because tests could detect motabolites, not just thc, yada yada.


The only reason I can think of, as to why sites are reporting shorter detection windows, is if tests themselves changed. If they aren’t as sensitive as before or something.

Then 2 hours go buy and there are no visuals, im sweating? So i go out to smoke a cigarette, and that's when i start feeling it. 

It wasnt like any acid trip i'd had prior, i felt numb- almost like my entire body was lagging. The colors were popping, and the moon was pulsating. 

So after fucking lagging in warzone bc my internet was acting completely aids, i decide to go to bed. Stayed up for a little bit, but not all night. I was sweating like crazy, and the numbness was intensifying. No visuals. Colors were popping out more intensly. 

I woke up, i have the rejuvenated feeling of acid, but my head hurts tbh.

 I'm seating in the waiting room. And they say the weight is 5 mins! I'm so nervous that my temp my be over 100 or quick fix may not even work!. I have it in my bra and it is burning so much lmao! Right now I'm the only one here! Okay so I got called back into the room and she did the paper work and got the test cup ready for me to use. She didn't tell me to take anything out my pockets or remove anything 🙌. Always so she hands me my cup and told me to head in the bathroom. When I pulled the quick fix out it read over 100!! I was so nervous! So I'm like this is do or die! I can't pour this in the cup without having it cool off! I even tired to open the cap and move it around to get cool air flow and even rest the bottle on the cold sink part of toilet! Lmao anyways! Now the lady outside is telling me to HURRY UP I NEED TO GET IT BEFORE THE TEMPERATURE IS TO COLD.  lm like shit! Lmao so I'm like oh duhh the cup has a temperature reading on it! So I poured the quick fix inside the cup and I got a reading of 97-98!!!! It was under 100 finally and was green and not a blue dot! So when I saw that I got out the bathroom and gave it to her. She checked the temperature and just poured it in the test tube and told me it be 1 to 2 days before I get news if I passed! I even asked her before I left lmfao if I passed! So I did my part with the temperature! Now just need quick fix to do its job! So I get this job! Praying 🙏 I will keep u update!!! 

Btw: heated the quick fix 15 mins before my appointment! So make one it be better for you! And I even put the hand warmer in the microwave too! 😂😂😂 Not for 10 secs but like 3 or 4 lmao and wrap two of them on the quick fix bottle.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,683441,public,confidence,self,Otw to take my drug test I hope quick fix works.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gxa43b/otw_to_take_my_drug_test_i_hope_quick_fix_works/,no_ads,0.0,1591410651.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm currently in a weird situation right now. I'm attending rehab because my parents threw me out a couple of months ago because of my drug problem (which in my opinion was quite manageable though noticeable because I didn't really know what to do with myself). I started the rehab because I didn't know what else to do. I can't live on the streets and I can't just leave my parents with the image of me being a drug addict. 
I've actually formed some form of drug abstinence decision for cannabis and cocaine, but I still want to do other drugs in moderate amounts and recently decided to plan for a trip on 2cb and ketamine (because no urine tests for those) while still being here to find out if I even wanna stay here or if all of this doesn't make sense. To really decide whether I wanna show my parents and the world what a great clean sober fuck I can be and so on or if I wanna make my own decisions and get the fuck out of there ASAP. Both of those paths may make sense, ask me if you want. 

Anyways. Now here comes the thing where it gets a bit tricky. I for my part thought it would be the best to trip alone. Though there's that girl I've met here who has to make some similar decisions because she's also here for someone else but for her it's even more clear that she's gonna continue to take drugs, the reason being her never having fallen on her face with her use and never having felt the actual pain of addiction, that being said I think she other than me has an addiction problem(cannabis, amphetamine and mdma). 
We've talked about tripping together already, of course. Now I don't wanna say it's a good idea, especially because she might be suicidal, has borderline and is depressed, but I don't know if she will understand by herself that life can be beautiful or if a trip might help her understand. Talking didn't really help so far and I really like her enough to really wanting to show her what life really can be so I need to know if I should trip with her or if I should trip alone because I'm scared the trip might even make it worse for her.

I think the therapists might not get to her during the time of the rehab but I myself am not a therapist, so I don't know if it even makes sense to start anything in that direction but the problem is that she already decided for herself that she's gonna get her drugs of choice if everything continues as it does, though I don't know whether she's just playing or not.

In a couple of days I'm planning to take 10mg 2CB with my girlfriend. We've both only taken 2CB once before separately and we both have experience with other psychs. 

I'm thinking of taking only 10mg because I've heard that at low doses 2CB can feel similar to MDMA whereas, at high doses it becomes a lot more psychedelic and I think right now, I'd prefer more of an MDMA-like experience.

Also, if the weather is nice, we're planning to take it at the park in the evening and then when it starts to get dark, we'll make our way back to my house. By the time we'd get to my house, both of my parents will most likely be asleep so I most likely wouldn't have to talk to them. I've heard that 2CB can be quite clear headed and easy to control so I was wondering how difficult would it be for me to talk to my parents if I have to? (I've spoken to my parents on LSD before and it was okay).

I was wondering what people think of this idea?

&amp;#x200B;

i began using periodically. drugs were a solution to every problem. sad? pop a few pills. bored? drink some cough syrup. lonely? smoke. no drugs? steal. even after every mediocre experience, i kept on going back. drugs seemed like a miracle to me, a perfect planned escape from the life i’d put up with for so long. i didn’t care how i used or what i used and most of the time i used shitty and “soft” drugs. it was all or nothing. sometimes i‘d get impulsive and try to OD (i was suicidal at the time), or purposely harm myself by not using harm reduction. it became a habit for me to get high every so often, and if i missed a time, i would get extremely depressed and start using other unhealthy coping mechanisms instead. although i never showed it, drugs were always on my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

i ended up going to a treatment facility almost 3 months after i started using drugs (i was also there for multiple other reasons as well). i was sober 3-4 months before deciding to relapse impulsively. it was not long before i started realizing i missed the good ol’ days of substance abuse and i returned once again. 

&amp;#x200B;

no matter what your drug life has been and what it is now, you almost have no telling of how far it’s going to take you and what path it’ll take you on. always use harm reduction and try to plan ahead for all kinds of situations, you’ll never know where you’ll find yourself.

So I created this account to share stories about the experiences I had. They're not all that special but I just wanted to put them somewhere, as my first post explains and maybe get some comments/feedback on some things. Since there will be stories about different drugs, I thought this sub might be the best choice.

Now this wasn't \_precisely\_ my first time consuming a drug i.e. non-legal psychoactive substance. There had been some very rare weed consumption before, including one time at an ex-girlfriend's birthday where her dad brought a big bag of weed and told ""us kids to do something with that"", following which we built a bong out of a plastic bottle and - me knowing nothing about how bongs work - I ripped it way too hard and fell asleep under the table. (She was obviously angry with me when I came to again.) Of course, I also consumed alcohol, nicotine and caffeine before which are definitely drugs, but I wouldn't need to create an anonymous Reddit account to share those stories, would I?

So here begins the story. That evening several years ago I was out to have a drink with my best friend and a few more people. As a country kid there was not much more to do on weekends than hopping on my bike and rideing it 10k to the next city to have a drink and a smoke at an old and famous metal bar. Now at this point I had already got to know the psytrance scene and seen people taking drugs and I think I might just have been eager to try something too. After 3AM and a few drinks, when the bar closed, we decided to continue searching for stimulation as we decided the evening hadn't ended yet. So we looked up what parties were going (there's just a handful of clubs in that city) and ended up at a HipHop event. Now, that is usually not my preferred genre at all, so it's a bit strange that we ended up there. But we were desperate and it was a student party, so we just went with it. The party also got a lot better when we met an acquaintance from earlier who was known to sell drugs. My friend and I decided to buy some speed paste from him, costing for something like a gram for 20 currency. (Maybe we also just bought half a gram, I'm not sure anymore.)",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,683389,public,confidence,self,Spontaneously taking Speed with my best friend (first drug experience),0,[],0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gx5085/spontaneously_taking_speed_with_my_best_friend/,no_ads,0.0,1591394086.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also is it adviced to wait a longer time after come down for the next hit or smoke as soon as comedown sets in for a better next hit.

We need to eradicate it through education. Tell people to do their own research so that they can spend 9 hours reading papers, wikis, forum posts, trip reports, every morsel of information needs to be sucked up like a hoover.

We got taught /all/ of this in school at an early age believe it or not because they could see what was happening to this planet and what we needed to know and what we didn't (still bitter over my Classics grade though!) (UK public school: not what you think America). 

Knowledge of real life situations obviously came after and so did the chem, pharmacology, complete abuse and misuse of drugs; #1; to go as far as I fuckin' could and #2; to give me the experience to become a drug counsellor in the future (hence Psychology in uni, not pharmacology + my grades were crappy; I went to Mexico to get fucked up like 2 weeks before my exams started instead of revising: this is /not/ funny or cool or whatever you're thinking. It was really irresponsible and I'm embarrassed looking back on it. 

I ended up going to an ex-poly (those in UK know these are the worst uni's sorry colleges in UK (they don't deserve the title uni). However while there I saw just how much drugs people would do if it were free or if they'd paid for it. 

Obviously the freebie customers came back after a few days and they paid full price, the paying customers took longer. So at the center of this is the idea that if you get something for free and don't have a lot to give in return, people will go nuts on it regardless but if you've already paid then that's yours, you took a lot out to help your mind (I dealt MD, weed, mcat and psyches in uni (everyone had mcat don't judge me! )) 

So the moral, the TL:DR: ""Learn to deal with overdoses right this second, we /are/ at war and respect your fellow human being regardless of race, creed, belief or even hatred. Take the hate with a grain of salt because they couldn't possibly understand the power to these compounds, how they could heal society from within and also how they could destroy it if improperly used or *cough* identified (psychedelics should not be class A or schedule 1 drugs).

At least McKenna said one good quote which was completely and utterly misread by 95% of the people that heard it: ""Turn on. Tune in. Drop out."" AKA: try acid, see the world for what it is, understand that this ""blasphemous"" knowledge will never be listened to by ""normal folks"". He's absolutely correct on that last one.

The only people that understand psychedelics are those that have tried them before, there is no in between.

These are also the people that later on will either sink or swim so learn to swim, for me, for you, for your friends, family, randoms in trouble, randoms that have had too much to drink, randoms that drop pills in girls drinks (the epitomy of life).

If no one else is teaching you what I have and can in the future, then there's something completely wrong with current society. Everyone is so fragile, afraid to hear the truth: ""the US government is collapsing under it's own weight, so they're using modern slave labour camps (jail) to increase their GDP and using drug laws to create villains in society"".

Oh but wait; that Oxy is pharmaceutically produced, it must be good for me; no, it's just posh heroin. Same with Adderall: posh speed. In EU we never even needed to bother with Adderall, we have enough base around to keep an army marching for months!

Pharmaceutical companies are your friend and the gov is the enemy; wrong again. The gov is just terrified of Trump, big pharma, big branding and global bankers, which all feed into; yep, the illicit drug industry.

Now I'm not saying that's a bad thing, in fact in EU it's great, cheap 87% pure Mdma, speed for a fiver/g, no meth, the Silk Road flows straight through to London so it's cracking H along the way and the Polish and Germans have absolutely mastered making meth, MD, speed, LSD, all the 2C's and Tryptamines, RC stims, benzos, cannabinoids and dissos.
They banned MXE though. The greatest slight to the public since the Thalidomide crisis. It was also a global ban so is absolutely unavailable. The one thing that could have saved us from the opioid epidemic, the economic collapse of the planet, the hunger crisis, (maybe not the weather) but nearly everything can be solved by a bit of love and kindness, which MXE gave in spades. You say ""yeah but wees is legal at least"" ; weed is a fly on the windshield of the potential for good MXE has. I mean.. there's no damage done by it, except the liver but alcohol is far, far worse. If you do too much, you hole and are unable to do anything... at all! The level just below that is almost psychedelia and I've had some incredible insights from it.

The last time I had real MXE was about 2 years ago. It was the last happy day I had and when ""Perfect Day"" comes on; my mind shutters through the memories of that day...because I remembered it, not 6 months after my accident (which caused temporary full blown amnesia) I still remember that day like yesterday.

Fuck weed, it's a tool of politicians to shut you up, find MXE and make a difference. I'm expecting GB requests BTW. It needs to make a comeback to set the world straight again.

""Never before have so many been so grateful to so few""
~ Winston Churchill

You think he'd have put up with this bullshit?! He did more blow than Thompson. That's what made them great leaders: passion, energy and a direct opponent. So who is our opponent? 

Lethargy - MXE helps with this as with nearly every other psychological issue (except if it's an actual problem like epilepse or cerebral palsy), it'd certainly make their days more fun though! It changes your mindset to happy, optimistic, it gives you drive, ambition, helps you sleep or if you're an insomniac: helps with the crushing pain of insomnia. It's also relatively cheap at 30e per gram kwhich will last 5-7 days. It got me through withdrawal with minimal issues at least 15-20 times. It helps every little problem so the big ones aren't so tough. It makes those issues the primary issues.

Simply put: it's Soma (if you don't know what this is, I suggest you read more Huxley). If you do know what Soma is then you'll know exactly how bold of a statement this is. 
It was portrayed as something that held one back and the psychedelics were the good ones, but a quote from the beginning says it all:

""Slightly stimulating, slightly hallucinogenic, slightly sedating and slightly euphoric"" - ***Aldous Huxley - Brave New World***

It will change the world for the better and it /really/ needs a change ASAP.

PS: This is me sober, for the first time in years. I'm going to get into some HC drug use now though, If you don't mind?!
Oh and ***MXE stopped all withdrawals. Instantly. ***

Hi! I am an 18 yr old mtf girl, I started taking 2mg of progynova two days ago and I also smoke weed a lot, now as much as I know weed does not pose any health risks to me while on eostrogen I have noticed that several chemicals in it are Cytochrome p450 enzyme inhibitors which I also now that estradiol valerate( progynova) is broken down by this enzyme. I cannot find any information on the effects of thc/cbd or any other flavonoid/terpene on the processing and effectiveness of hrt through the liver. So I just wanted to ask anyone with any knowledge regarding this/ any experiences mixing the two!!(logically using them together would decrease the amount of stuff broken down which is bad becuase the eostrogen is only usable after the cytochrome enzymes remove the valeric acid chain and convert it to estrodial) the half life of eostrodial valerate is 12-20 hours, so If i smoke weed in the 12-20 hours after taking these pills will it prevent the breakdown of the progynova? Many thanks A.J

Your brain IS changing if you are below 25 years old.

You are getting older, you are experiencing the things you once did differently, that is part of the process of getting older.

It is impossible to differentiate between ""brain changes"" due to advancing age and from drug usage unless certain imaging machines are utilized.

Even then! There is most likely nothing to compare the control to.

This is the last post I’ll make on this
Also I refer to this as a funeral but it’s friends and family gathering as only limited people could attend the real funeral

As it is people are coming to terms with a much loved friends death, he was genuinely respected and loved by everyone, he’s gone before his time which is truly sad. Not one of us will forget him. RIP bro ❤️

But anyway my addict friend was not invited as he is not well liked at the moment by some and was not very close to the friend (also we know the prick will turn up high). Despite this he still turns up. Not in psychosis but still very intoxicated. I know heroin addicts and while they lie and steal at least they still have some human decency, because I honestly cannot believe the disrespect he showed us. He turns up after the sermon very high, so immediately tell him to fuck off as I’m not in the mood for this and he proceeded to begin to talk family and friends who are attending the funeral. He begins to speak to the mother, who is grieving for her dead son. He is laughing and makes jokes about her son and makes remarks about his girlfriend.

Honestly shocked at his behaviour, how can meth make someone such a dickhead, surely he knew what he was saying was wrong and he would of never done this when I first met him. Has meth done some permanent psychological damage or something ? At this point it is made clear he needs to leave and I practically drag him away from the funeral as people are clearly debating whether to stab him or not 

I did not realise till after everything was done because I left but he actually had police after him, who approach the funeral looking for him and as people here don’t get on with the police and we weren’t social distancing it all kicked off, ruining the only send off my friend will ever get. In the most petty way. His family must of been devastated. Also fuck the police for escalating the situation, honestly breaks my heart the way things went down and I really feel for his close friends who didn’t get to attend the genuine funeral .

We walk under this bridge and I’m yelling at him what the fuck is wrong with you, I throw him against the wall. I am normally a very chilled out guy but I’ve had enough. Then out of nowhere he hits me and as I say while these days I am chilled out, I’m not just going to allow myself to get violated by this addict.So I just beat him up, I assume the meth allowed him to keep getting up as he didn’t go down easy. please don’t argue morals or tell me how I could of handled it because I don’t care. We’ve tried to help and the way he acted at my friends send off I will never forgive and I will have no sympathy when people “get even” with him for his behaviour at the funeral, honestly don’t care if they kill him and I know it’s harsh but I forget, I don’t forgive and he crossed a line.

Sorry for going a little of topic for the r/drugs subreddit but as I have written previous entries about this i thought I should show people the twat I have been trying to help for who he really is and who I really am because I know a good person would of dealt with him better.

It’s good of course, I’m just wondering if I’m alone here. Is this something that happens with age? 

Anyway I’m going to list the drugs/class of drugs  I now avoid/can’t do and these various reasons. 

Stimulants - the only stimulant I have experience with is cocaine. Every time I endure, I spend the next week with a heavy chest and high anxiety. The crash is awful horrifying. The high is underwhelming and it is very expensive, not worth the anxiety so I avoid. I can’t imagine the crash/comedown of something like meth so I don’t even both with stimulants anymore. 

Benzodiazepines - I’ve run my course with these drugs, experienced awful withdrawals and now have somewhat a kindling effect every time I take them again. I also have this lovely idea of how benzos should be, perfect calmness. However every time I take them now, I just get depressed and keep redosing till get to that calm state in till I eventually black out. 

Alcohol - hangxiety. Most of what I have to say on this. Other than that, it makes me tired and depressed and I get none of the euphoria I used to experience. 

Dissociatives - I was a massive fan of ketamine for a long time. I abused the hell out of it and used 1-2 grams every couple days for a couple months. I’ve had breaks but since then my tolerance has taken away most of the desirable effects. Would love to try something like pcp but I reckon the cross tolerance would probably ruin that too. 

Opiates - found codeine uncomfortable. I’ve done oxy a few times and don’t understand the hype. I’ve felt nice on percs but it’s not the blissful feeling people seem to take about. Also quite expensive so haven’t found them worth it since trying a couple times. 

Just going to throw this one out while it’s on my mind. 
Pregabalin -  I’m prescribed daily and need it for my anxiety so tolerance doesn’t allow for recreational use. I did have a couple of nice experiences pre-prescription though. 

I can’t think of any others right now but wack it in the comments if you can. I wouldn’t be suprised if I forgot a big class as my brains pretty mush due to ssri withdrawal at the moment. 

As I wrote this ^ I remembered the weed/psychedelics. Duh. Anyhow, they are easy to explain. 

Weed - extreme anxiety. Tried various things like mixing with cbd but I can never shake the anxiety. This has been difficult as I live in the UK so it’s illegal. Used to love it but it flipped on me one day and I believe daily use had completely flipped my brain chemistry for the worse. If you want me to explain that further, wack it in the comments. 

Psychedelics - this ones a shame because I find the visuals fascinating, I just can’t control the anxiety unfortunately. I’ve never experienced any euphoria from psychedelics, just anxiety. I really wish I was someone who enjoyed this class of drugs. Luckily I’ve been able to enjoy the visuals a few times when I was addicted to benzodiazepines.

I smoked weed everyday, 3+ grams a day, for almost 10 years, then quit due to anxiety. 

I now drink 6/12 bud light platinum which is 6%abv daily. I no longer get anxiety or panic attacks. I no longer feel as if I am dying daily. 

My question to you is,is switching demons okay? Or should I just go cold turkey and quit entirely. 

I have a son turning 1 year July 11th and I am turning 24 tomorrow, June 5th. I feel as if I am addicted to being not sober, but I can't seem to go longer than a week without getting drunk. But, when I was smoking weed, I literally felt like I couldn't go a few hours without smoking. Everytime I smoked, I had an anxiety attack, but I somehow someway liked the anxiety.

My best friend just came out to me that they’re totally dependent on coke.

We started together with casually snorting about 3 years ago, and in my case it was just an every now and then thing, making a line or two in bars or raves, although later on I did do it on my own at home but the urge for coke somehow died out and I’ve been clean for 2 years or so.

They, on the other hand, have been doing 1g/day+ for over a year now without a break and say they can’t stop.
The realisation of the harm it does is clear and they want to get off of it sooner than later.

They’re asking for help and I’m totally lost as to what I can help with.
My case is obviously not the same, as I never went anywhere near the volumes they’re doing.

Also, the partner doesn’t know, nobody at work knows and it’s supposed to stay this way.

From a person who did recreational drugs to a person who feels euphoria all day long and doesn't need these drugs anymore

Hi, guys, I want to share a personal (real) story that happens to me, and maybe it changes to science, and I revealed here something new.

All started when I was depressed and wanted to change my life.

I started with gratitude and positive affirmation.

But I didn't do it for 10 minutes a day as everyone does. I did it in a very exaggerating way all day 6 hours and more.

I write a list every day of 200 things to be grateful for. and the more I write, and the more I feel thankful, the more things to come that make me feel grateful.

And after I say loud positive affirmations for hours'' I am happy'' I am the king many times

before I sleep, I imagined all the right things happen today and say thank you 100 times.

It could be thank you. I have eyes I can see! Many people can't see

thanks, God, for having eyes! Thank god thanks thank god (x100 times)

within 15 days+ doing it I have intense euphoria throughout all day like Mdma or cocaine

I am not joking.

My days are just full-blown euphoria and good feelings.

Exactly like MDMA and even more.

When I see my grattitude list of hundreds of things to be grateful for i have full blown euphoria.

And I started from a depressed kid who can't be happy. now happiness is my natural state.

I really have strong, intense euphoria equal to MDMA level.

Hi there, I’m trying to do an extraction from “ABV”, cannabis plant matter that has been heated enough to decarboxylate THCa but not enough to combust the plant matter. I’d like to figure out the best way to isolate (decarboxylated) THC from the other components and plant matter with the proper solvent(s) and procedures. I have access to (relatively) sophisticated laboratory equipment and lab grade solvents.

My initial thought is, of course, nonpolars are the solvent to use, and I have no qualms about using solvents most would balk at like benzene, acetone, toluene, etc. But how to separate plant fats? 

Obviously chromatography is the best answer, but god do I hate running columns. I don’t think an A/B would work(?): THC shouldn’t form a salt. Does any solvent have a reasonably big difference in the Keq value with THC in comparison to the K value of it with fats? Acetone?

Maybe precipitation? Something that will increase the partition coefficient enough to effectively do a liquid-liquid extraction?

One night, after taking 4 hits of invader zim LSD tabs, I decided to break out the DMT and take it to another level. I was extremely experienced with LSD but relatively new to DMT and had only done it a few times before this, by itself.  


I also had about 8 beers, 10g of kratom and 2g of phenibut that night, so I was pretty messed up.  


I was peaking on the LSD and then loaded up a bong with 30mg of DMT (weed sandwich), a pipe with 30mg of DMT (weed sandwich) and then 20mg into a meth pipe. I was absolutely tripping at that point, but again, wanted to take this shit to a new level.  


I take the first hit out of the bong. Things start feeling weird, my vision starts vibrating and my body starts looking like I gained 200lbs and lost 2 feet in height. I was stumpy and fat.  


I take the 2nd hit out of the pipe. Shit starts popping off at this point. I start hallucinating vividly. I glance over towards my closet which was filled with clothes and random other shit - which has now been replaced by a dancing cactus with flailing arms, covered in esoteric christmas lights. I glance towards my RGB gaming keyboard which was set to a rainbow color shifting pattern. The keys were no longer english but some insane alien language. That's weird, I thought.  


I was having a hard time focusing and reaching my goal of that 3rd hit. I was alone and had nobody to help me. I pick up the meth pipe with the remaining DMT, I smoke it and my entire reality just melted away. I looked to my left, where I had a sexy woman poster in a bikini on my wall. I start blasting off at this point. I was staring at this poster, really just looking at her breasts, and suddenly her breasts started multiplying. 2 became 4, then 8... then 12. I was shocked. How could this happen? I suddenly became extremely horny, then a second later I completely forgot what horny means, what sexuality is, what sex itself is. I became even more shocked and worried - as a man this was hard to comprehend.  


I closed my eyes and was at ""level 2"" as McKenna described it. The ""chrysanthemum"" or the waiting room in his words. Seconds later a roaring rush of cackling energy invaded my ears and I started to feel as if I was falling through the earth at a great speed. Butterflies in my stomach. I SMASHED through this wall/doorway.   


Next thing I know the hallucinations suddenly stopped. My closed eyes observed blackness again. I was suddenly struck with that eerie feeling that you are no longer alone... that someone is watching you. Out of the corners of my vision these small fractals, like Tetris blocks, started flying into the center of my vision from every angle forming this strange face that I will never forget. In retrospect I believe I encountered the entity of Heyoka. When his face fully formed he started telepathically saying to me, repeatedly, ""I told you so! hahahaha. I told you so! hehehehe).   


I was so amazed and stunned I didn't know how to react. After what was probably 20 seconds of communicating with him I started flying backwards at great speed. I was shocked. I said out loud several times ""HOLY FUCKING SHIT"".  


I was flying backwards through this insane universe of hallucinations. I opened my eyes but could no longer SEE anything. I was looking at life through these glass bricks which distorted and bended light which were covered in flames (best way I can describe it). I gave up trying to see things and closed my eyes again.  


I was greeted by another entity. It never spoke to me, but it looked exactly like an Aztec god. In an Aztec god art-like pose it was surrounded by what looked like the Aztec calendar. Hundreds of foreign alien symbols. It's one of the most beautiful things I've ever witnessed. After a minute, this faded and was replaced by this shining marble like 3d cube which was carved out of random alphanumeric characters which were constantly shifting and the block was rotating.  


I open my eyes again and still cannot see anything. My vision was blanketed with rainbows of color and symbols. I started coming down shortly after that. I kept thinking and saying out loud to myself, again, ""HOLY FUCKING SHIT"". It's the only thing I could think of into rationalized thought at that moment.  


Suddenly, as I was coming down, I realized that I was listening to music. Tool - Third Eye to be precise, and the realization that I could hear music again was comforting as I slowly came back down over the course of the next 5-10 min.  


Then I just enjoyed the rest of the LSD trip. I will never forget that experience and it will stick for me for life.

PART 1:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gvmqzh/what\_are\_the\_dumbest\_things\_youve\_done\_while\_high/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gvmqzh/what_are_the_dumbest_things_youve_done_while_high/)   


These stories are probably less funny, more fucked up and embarrassing.  


When I was living in Berkeley, CA I went to a party, played the monopoly drinking game w/ tequila and got super drunk. Then a buddy gave me these pills. I can't remember what they were but they were some sort of downer or muscle relaxant. I was riding my bike and on the way home I decided to go to a store and steal some liquor. I got away with it, but when I went outside someone had stolen my bike. Fuck it, I just started walking home but was so fucked up I only made it half way before I decided to just lay down on the sidewalk of a VERY busy street and passed out. I woke up at 6am. Luckily nobody fucked with me, and I just finished walking home. (There are lots of druggies and burnt out hippies in Berkeley, this was probably relatively normal for the locals)  


Me and a buddy in highschool decided to sneak out at night, borrow (aka steal) his mom's car, drive from Tucson to Phoenix (\~2hr drive) in the middle of the night to go to a party and also deliver some coke to his friend up there. We got there, partied for a few hours, then decided to drive home. We got in the car and he was like ""dude I only have a 1/4 tank of gas"".... neither of us had money. We tried to siphon gas from a few cars in the neighborhood but completely failed. We just started driving anyways... maybe we'd make it... we ran out of gas about half way there, had to pull over to this trucker gas station and we started begging for change from random strangers at 5am. This random trucker ended up giving us $5 and we made it home before our parents woke up.  


Back when I used to still live with my mom I took something like 20mg of etizolam. I was a huge piece of shit back then and a fiend, so I decided to try to steal something from my mom to buy more drugs. I got paranoid that she would come back home early so I shoved a chair up against the front door to blockade it (the only way to get in). I gave up on stealing and just blacked out on the couch. Next thing I know I was woken up by 4 police officers (my mom understandably freaked out and thought I was trying to kill myself or something). They gave me a choice: go to the hospital or go to jail. Obviously I went to the hospital but they didn't do shit, they knew I was just high. I went home that day with a $3000 bill for an emergency room visit. Dumb.  


When I was in highschool I used to hang out with this homeless guy James. Me and some friends would smoke crack, meth and heroin with him in a tunnel underneath a street and listen to his crazy stories for hours. He sold newspapers on street corners for money, so one day I decided to help him sell papers for a cut of the profit. I was out there for a few hours. Dozens of people who knew me would see me and yell out shit like ""wtf are you doing?"". I sold 2 papers and made like $1. Looking back, it was incredibly embarrassing.  


I was growing mushrooms in my apartment. I wasn't a huge dealer, I just sold to friends and ate them myself. I got really drunk one night and forgot the mason jars full of shrooms and tons of little drug baggies on my coffee table. I was woken up by a loud BANG BANG BANG knocking at my door - you know, how the cops knock. I got up, ""who's there?"" - ""It's the \_\_\_\_\_ Police Department"". I completely forgot about the drugs in plain view of people standing at my door. I opened the door in nothing but my boxers. They were looking for some chick who had a warrant who lived in the apartment a few months prior. Luckily they left and didn't see the drugs. I could have gone to jail that day for a long time for manufacturing with intent to distribute a schedule 1 drug.  


I STILL feel really bad about this one... I was in highschool and really drunk and high on weed and coke. I invited this girl over, we hooked up. Then, laying there I asked her to be my girlfriend - even though I honestly wasn't really attracted to her at all. She said yes, then a few seconds later I literally said ""I didn't really mean that, I'm drunk"". She literally started crying and just ran out the door half naked. Fuck man, I've done a lot of fucked up shit but I hope she's ok now. Probably hates men.  


I have even more stories, there may be a part 3 if requested.

For medicinal purposes, life saving reasons, is the best reason. Next would be for scientific research purposes, in discovering ways to improve the welfare of living beings, as well as understanding reality, consciousness, and in general, the scientific understanding of the brain and cognitive structures / psychology. Next would be for personal spiritual growth, experiencing different states of consciousness, expanding perspective, to learn about the mind, and better it. Next for social fun, enjoyment, a good time, so to say. Next, to escape from reality, escape from the normal state of consciousness, which is one of suffering. And the worst reason to be doing or trying drugs is to fit in with the masses, to be cool, or like someone else, for popularity, social pressure, or for status contrary to one’s own beliefs. So there is a range of intentions when doing drugs which can be used as a reference in whether you are doing them for the right reasons, the first three I would say it would be positive, and the rest negative, thus I would encourage drug use if someone had honest intentions of the first reasons, and discourage it for the other reasons, based on its potential benefit to the individual and others.

This is a hierarchy of what is a good reason to a bad reason, relating to individual welfare, societal wellbeing, insight, wisdom, and inner peace. As always, the moral realist perspective holds, in that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions, based upon the axiom that morality necessarily entails the suffering and satisfaction of life, and the movement away from complete utter suffering for all beings across time would constitute the “good”. Thus, here we refer to the use of drugs being “right” when the net wellbeing of the situation is optimal to the progression of the individuals who indulge. This isn’t necessarily a utilitarian account of pleasure, as I believe suffering, as a rule, will always outweigh the pleasure, but rather, it is in looking for a morally neutral, or in a better case, a wellbeing optimal position, in which the use will instantiate.

Over the last two and a half months I’ve used Ketamine heavily. For a few months last year I was abusing DXM on its own on a daily basis. I imagine I’ve been I noticed some “warning signs” since a week or two ago - the effects of the drug started to feel different (and bad). I suffered a few incidences of somewhat mild psychosis, and for some reason I began feeling far more “confused” than I’m accustomed to while using dissos. I have been using ket *alone*, ie. not mixing with anything (besides nicotine or my occasional shroom trip) - so no stimulants/benzos/alcohol/etc. 

I think I’ve been using around a gram per day for a few weeks. I developed quite a large tolerance - plus the cross-tolerance from DXM (both NMDA antagonists). I feel like I’ve been using Ket to “escape” the psychological pain I’ve suffered over the last year - I’ve suffered some real tragedy and it has been super hard to deal with. And then to make things worse, just as I began to turn my life around (getting a new job, apartment, etc.) COVID hit, I lost my good job and have been free-falling psychologically ever since. 

Besides Ket feeling “different” from how it used to feel, I’ve now been left with a lingering “weirdness” in my brain. Beginning several days ago I started feeling like I was never coming all the way “back” from a dose. I’ve been left with feelings of being heavily distracted, impaired coordination, and difficulty multitasking. My pupils have been heavily constricted for the last 3 day’s despite backing way off - I’ve used less in the last 3 days combined than I had been using daily over the past few weeks. 

I’m not really sure what to do, or what help I should seek. Well, one obvious thing is to abstain entirely from Ket use for an extended period of time, so that’s in the cards for me at least. I don’t seem to be having any physical withdrawal symptoms. I’ve noticed very minor improvement in my mental impairment. I’m not suffering any delusions, psychosis, etc. but still experiencing the lack of coordination, trouble focusing etc. My vision seems to have improved some (though I’m not sure what’s with my pupils). My emotions seem to be coming back to a small degree (and that’s hard to deal with). 

I’m exceedingly anxious. I’m afraid of what I’ve done to myself. Has anyone else ever experienced this with short term heavy disso use? How did you improve your recovery? Did your mental faculties eventually return to a nominal level? How long did you experience the negative effects of the overuse?

So i arrived and was like kinda scared that I was going to get caught and then she lit the joint and we did like share the joint half-half. Then I felt like very relaxed but it only lasted for the first 3 to 4 minutes and I was just walking with her in a dark street with some street lights and I focused at a streetlight like 50 meters in front of me. But then after a minute i started realizing that it didn’t come closer no matter how fast I walked and that i was being sucked into the street lantern like I was in a dream. Then I ‘woke up’ and said to her:”wow this is crazy weed bro I am tripppin’ crazy hard“ and shit like that. But then the madness started: I was constantly sucked in and out of reality, I couldn’t think straight, when I started walking around in circles it felt like my legs were about 5 times heavier and I saw myself walking on the ground but my legs where so heavy that I couldn’t see them anymore, so I saw myself walking but my body was numb... and then I biked back home and it felt like I was doing everything in slow motion and everything was like repeating itself like my vision and sound was recorded and played over and over again. Then when I came home my mouth was so dry that it hurted so I drank allot, then I tried listening to music but it didn’t work bc I was tripping so hard that the sound was like sometimes very loud and other times the music faded softly away...

It's still in phase 3 clinical trials so if this medicine is shown safe and effective in improving the core symptoms of autism than the FDA will approve it to treat to autism, This gets my hopes up that there's finally a medication that treats the social impairments of autism.

Id say im (mentally) addicted to it at this point, like I cant get to sleep at all, if I dont smoke it and I get really stressed out and nasty to deal with.

My mums only condition with letting me smoke is that I have to do it outside, which i dont mind. It seems like I dont bother any of my neighbours with it until tonight. I was out there smoking and my neighbour popped his head out of his window (For context, I have two people living next door to me and they are both body builder types and Im a 5""7 9 stone skinny dude)  And my neighbour say ""Can you smell that"" I play dumb, had already stubbed it out, he stares me down and after a while says ""It smells like weed"" He could clearly see through my bullshit but I didnt waver. He continues prying for a little bit before giving up, remarking that he cant sleep. I should also admit that i have pretty bad anxiety (Waiting for the connection to weed in the comments for that one) So me standing and saying so what if i am is pretty out of the question

So yeah, my conundrum is where do i go from here? Ive tried going for a walk when i smoke but my mother aint having any of that. I could just wait until later but these guys dont turn everything off until 3 am minimum.

So I dont remember the actually times so I'm just going to use the T+ 000 minutes thing but a little bit of backstory. I had been taking dph alot during this time  (I do not anymore) and I was very bored on this ride and i was sitting in the middle of the bus i sat by a few friends but not that many. ok on to the story

T+ -005 I was sitting by the window with my friend as I counted out 30x 25mg pills or 750mg  and I sat there looking out the window for a little bit contemplating taking then

T+ 000 I consumed the 750mg with a can of monster and sat in my chair for a little bit and just looked out the window

T+ 010 I walked to the back of the bus to go talk to my friends I sat on the floor and chatted with my friends for a bit maybe like 40 minutes

T+ 050 I started to feel the effects when I was walking back to my seat and i felt my body start to get heavy and my vision felt slightly fuzzy but easily manageable, I also now realise the lack of judgement because I dosed more with another 15 pills or 375mg and now I was at 1125mg total

T+ 080 I was chilling in my seat talking to my friends but I could hear my words slurring and feel my mind go away my limbs felt heavy and I didnt really want to move I just felt pinned down at this point my friend I was sitting next too got up to go talk to our friends in the back of the bus.

T+ 100 at this point i was just sitting in my seat by myself (because my friend stayed at the back of the bus for most the night) not talking to anybody and I was just feeling the heaviness and the very slow feeling

T+ 130 at this point I was tripping hard I looked down and saw clear spiders crawling over my legs I tried hitting them but I couldn't catch them I tried talking to my friend who was still in the back of the bus at this point I also looked out the window and saw a bi plane like a very old school bi plane like Wright brother style plane and I thought it was so cool as it disappeared in the trees.

T+ 180 now this is the part where the blackouts start. I remember my friend moving to sit next to me they asked me if I was ok and I responded yes because I didnt remember anything from the past 50 minutes and didnt realise anything I did.

T+ 250 my friend sat next to me and asked my if I was ok again and  I said yea of course why wouldnt I be because I do not remember anything 

T+ 320 my friend came over to sit next to me again except I was on the floor this time I couldn't remember why but didnt think anything of it she asked me if I was ok and I just said omg yes!! and I didnt think about it anymore

T+ 400 my friend came over for the last time  and asked if I was ok and this point I was getting very annoyed and pissed off because I just wanted to enjoy my trip which was lasting alot longer than normal but I responded by saying yes please stop and I sat back down and tried looking out the window and a few minutes later a bunch of my friends were asking if I was ok and they were really worried but I didnt really care becaus of the dph

T+ 600 at this point I was coming down and just woke up from a black out my friend came over one more time and she asked if I was ok for the last time and I was much more clear headed now and said yea I am thanks for asking and realised everyone was asleep so I decided to fall asleep

T+ next day I woke up and my friends asked again if i was ok i just said yes and asked if they were asking me last night they said yea and I asked why. They said that I was talking about how the were riding on a plane even tho we were on a bus and that the view from the top of the earth was amazing. The also said they kept asking me because I apparently was freaking out about all the spiders and talking to people who werent there  like talking to the window or to an empty seat. They also said i was sitting on the floor in front of my seat rolling back and forth and I was speaking gibberish and rubbing the floor and saying that I'm trying to kill the spiders even tho there were none there. They also said that I was freaking out about my friends pocket charger because it was a giant venomous spider and that point I realised that I had blacked out multiple times that night and they were all worried because most of them didnt know that I had consumed dph but the at this time they were still very concerned but they realised now I was ok and I was stupid and dumb

I now no longer do dph and i find it very stupid and dumb even though I used to do it very often but yeah at this high of a dose I was very powerfully hallucinating like real delirious hallucinations and was slurring words and talking gibberish saying random words and over all sounded not ok

Edit: I forgot to mention it but everything I was looking at was like waving and moving back and forth like a shrooms come up and the mental space was crazy as I was thinking I was just trying to enjoy this trip that was like 3 or 4 hours but went almost 12 hours but I was having multiple panic attacks and freaking out",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,683195,public,confidence,self,DPH Trip Report. - A bus ride to remember,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gwrv8w/dph_trip_report_a_bus_ride_to_remember/,no_ads,0.0,1591338671.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 6 weeks ago I had half a pill of MDMA that caused a really bad comedown for me. It was my first time trying ecstasy. It caused anxiety and insomnia as well as other mental health problems that I have now mostly recovered from 6 weeks later.

This experience has really put me off ever experimenting with most other illegal drugs. The only drug that I'm still somewhat interested in trying is psilocybin mushrooms.

If I am going to try shrooms in the future, I'm going to wait many months to make sure a long time has passed since my MDMA comedown, and I will take a small dose on my first time (or maybe every time).

How risky would trying shrooms be given my MDMA comedown experience?

Then all of a sudden I couldnt breathe right. The only way i can describe it is like i had on a teeshirt that was wayyy too tight around my neck. I kept getting lost in thought and then all of a sudden would take a breath like i just came up from being under water.

My thoughts were wild... going from ""look at my dog, he hates me, I'm positive he's about to attack me"" (my dog is a blue nose pit and was sleeping with his head on my legs peacefully like always) to telling my boyfriend that all he cares about is his phone and that we have absolutely no connection (He was on his phone reading about bad trips and how to help me through it.)  and by the 4th hour i was crying and telling him that I was certain i wasnt going to make it out of this and that i was sorry and to please tell my dad i love him....

I eventually fell asleep for about 4 hours and when i woke up... I was STILL trippin! it wasnt as strong but definitely still felt the effects.... and it was making me cry. about. every. fucking. thing. ever.

- Brain processes information a lot slower
- Feeling fatigue, a lot stronger than normally
- Can't speak properly - main one that actually gets on my nerves the most. What I mean by that is when I'm trying to speak, I lose words. It is very hard to construct sentences! Very hard! I get lost in what I'm saying. Best I can do is about 2/3 words and then my brain just mix itself. I have to think hard on what to say and then try to speak it out. But then I get lost after few words.

From what I've Googled it is very much *Dysarthria* . However, when I'm sober I'm all good! Completely fine, only when I have some Charlie I don't even drink that much with it no more. Maybe 2/3cans most!

Hi, guys, I want to share a personal (real) story that happens to me, and maybe it changes to science, and I revealed here something new.

&amp;#x200B;

All started when I was depressed and wanted to change my life.

I started with gratitude and positive affirmation.

&amp;#x200B;

But I didn't do it for 10 minutes a day as everyone does. I did it in a very exaggerating way all day 6 hours and more.

&amp;#x200B;

I write a list every day of 200 things to be grateful for. and the more I write, and the more I feel thankful, the more things to come that make me feel grateful.

And after I say loud positive affirmations for hours'' I am happy'' I am the king many times

before I sleep, I imagined all the right things happen today and say thank you 100 times.

It could be thank you. I have eyes I can see! Many people can't see

thanks, God, for having eyes! Thank god thanks thank god (x100 times)

&amp;#x200B;

within 15 days+ doing it I have intense euphoria throughout all day like Mdma or cocaine

I am not joking.

My days are just full-blown euphoria and good feelings.

Exactly like MDMA and even more.

When I see my grattitude list of hundreds of things to be grateful for i have full blown euphoria.

&amp;#x200B;

And I started from a depressed kid who can't be happy. now happiness is my natural state.

I really have strong, intense euphoria equal to MDMA level.

I used to be a major coke head, but luckily stopped at 16. Now I'm almost 20 and got curious... So ofc bought 0.5g. And 10g flower to get me through the comedown.

All in all a pretty good bender, however now that I've been sober for a while I'm feeling very depressed. I know that this is normal and also expected it, the thing I didn't expect was that I decided to spend 3000 on sex toys while fucked. I don't have that money, I used money I inherited from my dad(which I never touch in relation to unimportant purchases usually) and I also choose to get all 7 packages shipped directly to my door, instead of to a nearby shop. This is bad because 1) I live with my mom and 2) the delivery dates are all set during the one week this summer my mom will be home.

I know that this doesn't sound too bad I guess, but I'm just feeling so ashamed of myself. It's not even like I need any toys, I guess I just wanted them cause the coke made me horny but unable to finish if you get me. I feel absolutely disgusting like who does that. And I'm panicking constantly because what happens if my mom is at home and opens a package? It's not even remotely 'mild' toys, so I don't even wanna think about the reaction. I tried canceling all of my orders, but they had already been shipped so it was too late. Honestly at a fucking loss, did not expect this to happen at all.

I've been a daily weed smoker mainly for the past years, but this tears it enough that I think I need to be sober for a while.

I walked day and night,   near the drop-in centers.

 -coming down off fentanyl and meth at the same time was the most suffering I've ever gone through. Itching and picking at my sores until they turned into deep wounds. It wasn't until day 15 of without drugs that I started to believe there was  light at the end of the tunnel.-

 Talking to the homeless living there, I realized one thing, everyone that wanted help was ""looking"" for work. So I told myself I will go and finish my education. I know where the path on drugs leads and I will not continue on like this as long as I'm Living.  

  I went to every damned social services center in my city. There was but 1 that could give me any sort of help. They directed me to an academic center for troubled youth. It was only there, that I had a one on one  meeting the principal. He asked me why I was there, I told him ""I want to finish school""
He smiled at me he said ""I don't hear that enough""
He pulled up my academic records seen I had a good history. And offered me THE OLIVE BRANCH.  

My principal, Mr.Petingula said that I would slowly be introduced back into school. He referred me to a temporary housing for youth. And gradually I became a school student again. I finished grade 10 and 11 in 10 months. 

Next school year comes. Im in grade 12. Clean and sober. Feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment unlike ever before.

I achieved the highest grades in the school. I devoted all of my will power to school. At this point I'm living with my grandma. Things with family are just starting to get better. And randomly I get a letter in the mail from the local university, it says they want me in open studies. 
-I thought to myself that 11 months ago I never would have imagined I'd be in this position. 

So In 8 more months I finished highschool, with the 7th highest grades in the city. I've been attending the university. And I found my calling with scienctific maths. Specifically nuclear physics. All of my schooling is paid for by the university. I received bursaries of up to 20k for all sorts of different things. 

I registered for Applied Mathematics, and put the course on hold to find a job and move out of my grandma's. 

1 year later:

 I have work experience. I got promoted at work, I am now level 2 pay Grade. I am paying for my own apartment.  

I went back school to make a name for myself. 
I ended up taking 2 courses instead. Applied Mathematics and Nuclear Physics. I've been studying like a mad man. Just recently I decided I'm going for a PhD. 

Thats is how I treated the last 5 years. 

The crazy thing is, when I was a homeless junkie. I knew I would do something great. I just never knew how or when it would unfold.

It made me feel relaxed and I could easily eat half the fridge, but as I was smoking more and more the high got worse. Nowadays I get extremely anxious when high on it. 5/10

Alcohol: First time at the age of 15. Makes me socialize much more and feel a bit drowsy. Can't avoid puking at the very high amounts :D. 6/10

LSD: First time at 17. The first two hours of the high were very enjoyable because of all the visuals I got from it. As the hours were passing the more anxious, angry and isolated I was becoming. Won't go in to details. For some a very good drug but for me the worst drug. 1/10

Speed aka Amphetamine: First time at 17. Kicks in pretty fast and gives a slight rush and a long lasting energy. Very good drug to socialize and work. Had a complete loss of apetite and couldn't sleep. 6/10

Mdma: First time at 18. Insane rush of happiness and love. Good to socialize. Never wanted the high to end. Complete loss of apetite and had lucid dreams while sleeping every time. Makes you fall in and out of conciousness at the very high doses. The day after was the worst for me. Please stick to the 3 month rule and take suplements! 9/10

Xanax: First time at 15. Kicked in faster than I expected. Made me feel completely relaxed and carefree. Had extreme munchies and the sleep was beautiful. Overall still nothing special or it's just not my type :). 6/10

Valium: First time at 15. Lost a bit of anxiety and that's it. Not my type. 2/10

Tramadol: First time at 16. Yes.. A weak opiate but I put it on the list just to inform people about it. Gave me a slight rush of euphoria at the first two hours but later on was just feeling extremely relaxed and sleepy. Could't avoid puking and had no apetite for the next whole day. To get the best out of it make sure to take doses every half an hour and not all at once. 4/10

Tapentadol: First time at 19. Kicks in very fast and gives a cute rush of calmness and a warm feeling. Got me nodding at the third pill.The best starts when u mix a benzo to it but I highly unrecommend it because of the risks. One of my favourite drugs. 10/10

Cocaine: First time at 18. Kicked in fast. Had my tongue numb. Almost no euphoria but had insane energy. The high wore off pretty quickly and couldn't resist taking more and more.

Is it dangerous to have my pupils dilated basically for a week straight? I feel like the dilated pupils are the result of SSRIs side effects being boosted by speed..

i normally pay like $7-8/oz from my vendor for their cheapest strain, but i decided to experiment and see what the fuss was about so i bought red maeng da at twice the price ($15/oz)

Hope someone has advice.

Nowadays my anxiety is really bad to the point I don’t even wanna talk to my family or see friends.
Its hard to go to the store and eye contact is terrible, I overthink a lot.

When I watch videos where people are talking each other I start analyzing why would they say that and other bullshit. I dont know where this started, but I ask myself why did he say that word, why is he talking in that way.. stupid shit.


Before my anxiety this bad but I think its because of my drug abuse. I was addicted to benzos at 16, smoked weed here and there, drinking..

At 17 started experimenting with other drugs, just trying everything and all kinds of pills.

Got my own place when I turned 18 and everything went downhill. Couldn’t stay sober for more than 3 days. Just using whatever. 


Im becoming really awkard because I overthink everything and it turns to anxiety. I been sober for the most part for like 2-3 months, only occasionally using something but I did smoke weed for some time.



I am mostly happier and dont really have cravings.. but my anxiety is really bad and I don’t know what to do about it. 

I try to excersise as often I can, but even going to the gym gives me anxiety. Feeling really hopeless about it and feel like just saying fuck it and using drugs again.


Even chatting to people online to people I don’t even know gives me some anxiety which I never had.

I just overthink everything I say and they say and analyze everything.

It shouldn't be a problem right? But ever since, I can't even enjoy a beer...

I have this weird dizzy and anxiety inducing feeling in my head right after drinking. It's like I'm buzzed but my mind is not anymore, I'm not sure if that makes sense but when I focus on the diziness it's like I can feel the emptiness in my head and it makes the anxiety skyrocket.

I cried myself to sleep for weeks thinking I was going psychotic/schizophrenic. After that my depersonalisation persisted but my then girlfriend reassured me I wasn’t going crazy and by keeping myself distracted, the fear disappeared but the DP continued. Overall between then and February I get my anxiety slowly getting worse and worse. Then in February, I stupidly took 4/5 tokes of hash and in the days after that i experiences severe anxiety/ worsened depersonalisation. Then my fear of schizophrenia came back. I spoke to my therapist and she advised I enquire about SSRI’s which I am currently 10 weeks into and they have helped with the chronic worry. However, this is what I’m currently experiencing:

- extremely hyper aware
- constant fear of being psychotic
- constant googling 
- negative in general 
- still experiencing depersoanlisation

Just figured you guys would be well informed about typical stimulant effects.

So I’ve been taking 27mg extended release methylphenidate every day for about a year without any problems. The time release on that one is really good, so it’s constantly dispersing small amounts of the stimulant over an 8-10 hour period.

I recently switched to the 20mg “long acting” methylphenidate which I guess has a very different time release mechanism. You basically get a full 10mg all at once, then the rest of it a few hours later. 

Recently I started having this problem where around 4-5 hours after I take my meds, I start feeling really awful. Pupils are crazy dilated, I get the chills, I almost feel like I’m on MDMA. The weird thing is though, I don’t feel overstimulated like I normally do if I overdo it on Ritalin. I don’t remember if this started right as I switched over, but I switched two weeks ago and it’s definitely gotten worse over the last three days.

Could this be from the methylphenidate or could something else be going on? The hypochondriac part of me is worried about serotonin syndrome because I’m also taking Prozac daily. Seems weird that I’d have effects this strong when my body is well acclimated to methylphenidate at this point.

Reddit was truly a place where people understood me when no one else would.   


I haven't touched drugs at all for nearly a year now. Recently I got a plug who was able to supply me with Xanax. I have been using again for nearly 2 months but never more than 2mg a day, and only for my social anxiety. (I used to abuse Xanax around 15mg daily for a couple of months before stopping).

I now have a stable high paying job, which my father was able to arrange for me. I really like it there and my life was finally starting to make sense and I felt happy again. Recently my parents told me to take a blood test randomly, to make sure I wasn't on anything. 

They told me that if anything is found, I will be kicked out of the house and they'll make sure my boss fires me. My only option would be to go to rehab for 3 months.

I'm not going to do that.

They just had to ruin it. 

I guess this is just my last rant. On my way to stock up on a cocktail of drugs and alcohol and have one last night of fun before I take a really long sleep.

I feel bad for my family but I can't cope with this anymore. I can't go to rehab. I can't lose my job. I can't lose my girlfriend. 

I guess I was not made strong enough to cope with this life. 

I know people who had a much tougher life and got through it, but I guess that's just not who I am.

As a person who had been abusing fentanyl and meth for years, I can say being 100% honest is the only way you will recover. You have already started by browsing on here looking for perspective. 
Everyone uses for different reasons, just get real with yourself. Start questioning your actions and intentions. You must understand what influences your choices. Is it your environment?  An escape from reality? Is it the need for attention?
Once you have found the variable, you can take control of it. 

 I overdosed after smoking too much fentanyl, in an alley. A fellow homeless man walking by seen my body on the pavement, pale and life less. Thankfully, he went to get help. The Man gave me back my life.

After the incident. I wanted to get off the streets.  So I started taking action. Step by step. As I progressed on, I developed a sense of direction. With that sense of direction, came purpose. 

At the end of the day you make the decisions, ONLY YOU CAN SAVE YOURSELF.

Got up to go get water and as I enter the kitchen I feel I’m going to faint and down I go. I was able to brace my fall with my arms. I was lucid the whole time but I got tunnel vision and “was-wa-wa”’s. My arms tensed up in a weird pose and my whole body shook for ten seconds until I was able to stand up.

The pain I feel is greater than a dental fracture. A woman I talked to who had a dental fracture too said that it's worse than giving birth. Imagine giving birth everyday for more than two months. I'm amazed I'm not dead.

Magic mushrooms, LSD, these two are readily available to me and can give me a quick fix.

Also, I spoke about being diagnosed with mood congruent psychotic feature but my EEGs and MRI turned out completely normal. My problem might actually be supernatural as my first neuropsychiatrist had suggested, and I'll have to see some exorcists.

Conventional western meds have been known to worsen psychosis anyway. I think I'd rather just take psychedelics and then if my ""psychosis"" gets worse, then I'll go have that treated.

Because let's face it: psychiatry is ineffective. Only 40%-60% get better, but it will 100% take weeks to take effect and 100% will make you feel worse before you feel better, and you will 100% become dependent on the meds.

Additionally, can I take paracetamol before taking these meds? I am diagnosed with migraine too. IKR? I'm a walking, seething mass of pain. I'd kill myself now but I still quite like my life despite it. I have so much to live for, so many lofty dreams and aspirations, and today, on my 26th birthday, I found I am well-loved by many.

1:19: full body high. Almost like a vibration that never ends. Teeth are becoming numb. Words on the phone are starting to sway a bit. There’s also a slight rainbow tint on some things. It’s hard to describe. Imagine a white piece of paper and on that paper you see the faintest light spectrum shining. It’s almost unnoticeable. 

1:24: going to smoke some dabs

1:26: decided to take a bite of left over hamburger helper before smoking. That was good. 

1:28: I realize this dose is extremely different than the rest. While it was only 1 tab it seems to be consuming my god damn soul as I type this. It feels 3x stronger then any other tab I’d taken from this batch.  Slightly concerning. I thought they were all equal. 

1:32: despite realizing I’m in the deep end I decide to trudge forward. Smoking hit after hit. Viberations increasing. Thoughts flood my mind. Words are shaking on the screen. While typing this. I hope this becomes an insightful trip

1:36: almost puked. This shit is gettin gg intense 

1:38: still puffing the vape like it was a cigar 

1:41: time for the 8th smoke break this far

1:42: it feels as though my entire head and body  is covered by this thing I can’t see. It’s like a warm embrace. Doesn’t have to be a bad thing.

1:50: visuals are increasing. Limited thought process. Food and drink taste odd. Feeling more sexually charged than normal 

152: This is unnerving. My mind feels like it’s filled past it’s point. A continuous pressure inside

1:55 I’m very very high. Holyshit . Oh haha wow. Words are full blown dancing everything is shaking strong visuals 

2:00: smoke break?

2:01: I feel my mind freezing. Not cold but flooded. Overdrawn. Overloaded

2:05 playing music, teeth feel entirely numb. Dragging effect to everything. Like real lag

2:08: very tense  Sexual and physical 

2:12 peace with life

2:16: I wonder if anyone will actually read this

2:21everything is flashing fun but scary 
Heart racing. 

2::27Music makes me feel at peace teeth are chattering like I was cold

2:32:smoke dabs. Time to push on deeper time is irrelevant 

2:35: rush of euphoria

2:40: smoke break/ this world is so much bigger than us. Find love and meaning in the moment. It won’t be found anywhere else.

2:43: “day dreaming” by Radiohead 

2:48: uneasy rush. Really intense

3:00: gonna try to make sexy time

3:10: op found blood on his penis and legs. Op is changed. OP is traumatized 

3:39: op services himself

3:45: nearing the peak. Or what if the peak is already gone. I truly hope it wasn’t spent in terror. 

3:57: smoked dabs blast off

4:03: walk outside into the fresh country air. Rush

4:14: the trees outside are breathing and changing slight colors. It’s beautiful. 

4:25: faced with some cold hard realizations I didn’t want to deal with but needed to

4:36: the start of the comedown. Effects are weakening but still very much there. Feeling like I could eat a buffet. Feeling nothing but absolute peace in every way possible. 

4:45: food is so damn divine

4:50: Strong visuals persist but I feel there’s less weight on me somehow. It feels bliss

5:05: Losing interest in the whole “study”  idea of mine lol/ vibing to Mac DeMarco

5:15: thinking of all the hell ive put my father through. Maybe it’s time to forgive him for the past

5:30: coming down even more. Still higher than balls but able to articulate. This was and is a beautiful trip. 

5:39: smoking dabs, time to gently float down

5:42: did not gently float down. Gently got deadfucked up and thrown back in the deep end

6:00: Starting to feel extremely exhausted. It’s been a long night. No regrets though. Maybe I should play some fallout new Vegas... yea I’m gonna play fallout.

6:10: step mom gets trapped in dryer. What a classic 

6:32: got side tracked by my meme page on fb

6:41: sobering up. Still foggy but we’re getting there.

6:45: I read everything I’ve type out so far. I’m genuinely blown away. This is why I did this. I’d forget so much of it all already. The feeling the magic. You can’t recall these different parts of the trip because they can only be described in the moment. That’s why no one can describe an acid trip to a T. You forget the minor details. The minor details is what makes it’s so damn beautiful. It’s like your soul is on a roller coaster ride. It’s always shifting. 

7:02: coming down quickly. Almost over now. There’s a sense of happiness and slight sadness knowing it’s coming to an end. It was a life altering experience. The trip may be nearing its end but this peace I’ve found will last a long time. 

7:44: almost back to normal minus the mind fucking fog still present haha. I’m gonna have to sleep that part off.

I dont know, just feel like getting my experience out there for my own sake. 

I abuse alcohol. It makes me feel like shit and after a particularly bad night that I was conscious for, I dont think I could stomach it if I tried. 

Ive tripped two times, rolled once, and candy flipped once. 

Rolling is fucking awesome but I find the waiting to be tedious. Its worth it, but I dont want it to consume my time. 

I loved tripping but honestly? I found I didnt get a lot out of it. Well I sort of did, I struggle with self harm and looking at my scars was awful and mentally taxing as hell. It got me my longest clean streak in a while though, so Im grateful for that short period. 

And candy flipping was actually really neat. I did it on a night of thunderstorms, and I fucking hate(d) and feared storms. But I went for a walk around my block while peaking, put headphones in, blocked out the sound, and saw the clouds. Lightening is beautiful when its distant and youre dry and cant hear the storms. 

And honestly? I feel fried. 

I know doing them have helped me though, Im introverted and self conscious but Im more open and honest and am trying things Ive always wanted to but havent because of fear.

So why do crack which is all rush and no legs and is extremely fiendish; when you have iv coke which from the people I talked to is much better than smoking crack. 

Maybe people don’t wanna inject but then I don’t get why they don’t just go do hexen which is legal or mdpv; both of these drugs have rush that rivals or beats out crack(based on subjective reports). Alongside with the rush they also acc have a really good high albeit short.

I was shaking and my speech was impaired. I stayed at the park for a little while 40 min tops but decided to leave bc there were people there and I was very paranoid. I went back home and my trip sitters decided to micro-dose so that they would have fun as well. Through the whole trip I was completely it of this world but not in a beautiful holistic way. I couldn’t recognize anything, my vision made everything look alien which is the point to the trip but it was truly scary. 

I decided that I didn’t want the visuals to go away bc 12 hours had past so I took 2 other tabs(230ug) and man that was a mistake. I was awake all night and I couldn’t stop hearing voices. I didn’t see my hand in from of my face. I went bling for a minute and it was scary af. I was screaming and crying and laughing. I thought I was falling into madness. I was convinced had Schizophrenia and that I was going to be locked up in an asylum. At 6 am when my bf went to work I was extremely sleep fed deprived and still hearing voices in my head. I broke down in tears and hated everything. I had to go to work as well but everything was still affecting me.

At work I was confused and constantly moving erratically. It was awful not being able to control myself. I had dropped before plenty of times but idk I think this was very dangerous for me.

When I smoke and eat now I just eat regularly, I don’t even get the munchies anymore. But I’ve lost that 15 pounds and then some and cannot get the weight back at all.

Our plan was basically to fuck all day and smoke some more.

Like 4h into the trip (100 uq) I took a huuuuge bong hit. Btw smoking weed on acid is kinda new for me cause I couldn't smoke the last year. I smoked the last 4 years before that year like everyday. In my no smoking year I took a lot of shrooms and acid cause that was the only drug I could use and I really fell in love with them. So basically I took acid every weekend for the last couple of months.

Now back to the story. After my bong hit I felt kinda uncomfortable and wired so I layed in my bed and chilled. I had a pretty stressful week so I thought I might need to relax and listen to some music.

Suddenly I felt like something hit me in my brain like a hammer, it wasn't painfull I was just disoriented as fuck. Like when you are 14 and smoked to much weed for the first time but times 10. At the same time the visuals got really really really intense. I couldn't see my gf or my room cause everything went rainbow colors. And when I moved my head I could feel it moving but my vision didn't move. Like reality was completely broken.

It got worse and worse and i couldn't remember anything like how I got there  and why I feel so wired.
At one point I couldn't even talk. I just panicked and wanted it to stop. My gf who was on acid to tried to calm me down and we tried to fuck which made it even worse I acted like a fuckin monkey which just discovered his dick and the orgasm was fuckin nuts I just thought I died and got lost in the darkness of the universe than I remembered that I had closed my eyes 😅 

After that I had multiple breakthroughs about my life and every time I figured something out like I shouldn't  smoke weed every day or just take acid to pass the the time I finally got better and felt like my brain has started to work normal again like the acid would only let me go if I figure that out. So after 6 hours of pure hell I finally got better and now I am doing a acid break for 2 or 3 months. After that I was really happy and glad I didn't went nuts

Highly recommended for beginners or anxious and fearful people.**

Biology student here.

There are impressive news, which may open up ways to actively induce good trips and positive ego deaths.

Check it out, weeks ago this paper was published, where *Mason et. al*  researched the different neurotransmitters correlating with ""positive  or negative ego dissolution experiences"" on serotonergic psychedelics.

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-0718-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-020-0718-8)

The researchers found that lower glutamate (the main excitatory  neurotransmitter) in the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are correlated with good trips, while higher levels of glutamate are  correlated with bad trips.

This  has serious practical implications - higher glutamate excitation is  naturally countered by the brain via GABA release (the main inhibitory neurotransmitter). More GABA in the medial prefrontal cortex and  hippocampus should consistently be able to induce good trips.

**This is a big deal.**

**Using glutamate-inhibitory or GABAergic substances, herbs and supplements may  be a highly effective method of actively inducing good trips and  positive ego deaths.**

Lavender oil is GABAergic and is a crazy strong anti-anxiety supplement  (comparable to benzos in anxiolytic effect size), with no serious side effects and no addiction potential.  
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612440/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612440/)

Anecdotally, I can report that every single time I combine psychedelics and lavender oil (80mg softgels) there is no anxiety or fear left and all my  tripping friends have a great time.

L-theanine is also GABAergic and a mild anxiolytic. Anecdotally, every single trip  combined with high doses of L-theanine was very positive.  
[https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/72/8/507/1919604](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/72/8/507/1919604)

At last, obviously, GABA is GABAergic. But there's controversy around if any supplemented GABA actually reaches the brain.

Meditation also reduces activity in brain areas known to cause bad trips.

Caffeine actually increases glutamate activity, so high doses of caffeine may  actually be involved in causing some people's bad trips.

Of course, all these things may only decrease the chance of having a bad  trip. Do not worry that the nature of psychedelics will be changed with  this: Horror trips will still happen; there will still be negative  experiences to learn from. But especially for beginners and  anxiety-prone people, using lavender oil and l-theanine may prove to be a  great tool for decreasing anxiety and fear.

10/10 recommendation for using l-theanine and lavender oil in combination with shrooms, LSD and DMT.

First some background: I personally have a really bad self image. I hate myself for a lot of reasons, some actual things like I think I’m ugly or I feel like a failure, and some are things that just aren’t possible like I annoy everyone and I am just the absolute worst human alive. This is kind of a shitty way to explain it but I know someone will understand. I have recently been trying really hard to change my personal opinion about myself and I’m trying to counter these negative thoughts. Like when I get really down about my appearance I remind myself that there are 9 billion people on this earth and at least 1 person out there has seen me and thought I was the prettiest girl they’d ever seen. Or if I think I’m just the most annoying person ever and I think everyone hates me, I will remind myself that I have people who will message me just to ask how things are going. And if I’m quiet at work to avoid annoying others, people go out of their way to talk to me. Okay so enough background, I apologize I just felt like this needed to be primed in order to come to my question. 

So I know people have said that after they tripped on Acid/LSD/Shrooms they kind of had a change in perspective in life. They became clearer with reality, opened up about so many things. I was watching a documentary and this man had mentioned that if you take a psychedelic and you go in with a certain mindset like “I am going to paint this amazing picture” or something then you can get it done and really connect with yourself. So I was wandering since I am already working towards that positive mindset about myself and I am curious to try psychedelics do you think that it is possible for me to go into the trip trying to reword the way I think about myself in relation to the world to where I think more positively and stop being so harsh and negative? 

Counter to that is it possible that even if I take psychedelics with the total mindset that I want to love myself more and things like that, that my deep rooted hatred could actually counter my trip and make me dislike myself even more?

Additionally am I overthinking these trips? I’ve never done any psychedelics. I want to but I’m scared of bad after affects like the possibility of Acid Flashbacks and what not. Is tripping on Acid really as incredible of an experience as people and documentaries have mentioned. I can’t even begin to imagine! 

I apologize for the long post, I just felt like that was probably the best place to finally reach out and ask these questions! Please you can just comment or even message me, I really want to discuss this overall because I am incredibly curious! Also I apologize for bad grammar and sentence structure.

It opened my eyes to many things and it helped to release fears of mine. I think because of the dissociative effects it can give you a “third person perspective” on your life and things you worry about. When I wasn’t high from it a day later, I had some weed and I was getting stoned and I was like I could go for another bowl/cones, after like 6 bowls/cones I’ve had. Before I was afraid of being way too high but I’m not feeling paranoid or scared about how high I get now, which is kind of a good thing? Let me know but I think it’s good in some parts and bad in some others. I want to try dxm with weed and see what it’s like, according to my m8 he said doing them together is like a whole different drug, and it feels super good. 
That’s basically it, I think I’m just going though a more curious phase about the limits of being high. That sounds like I’m taking some other harder drugs but I will never touch meth and heroin that is the most terrible thing that has effected people in multiple ways. My friend she is in and out of juvenile detention at 15 because of them harder drugs. It’s not an easy path to take.

But it's always there. Meth did not do that. Also, meth caused more of a euphoria similar to microdosing LSD. Mind you, I only took the street meth in 'therapeutic doses' and mostly orally.

My idea was that by combining Vyvanse, Clonazepam and a slither of LSD, I might end up with a coctail that would produce similar results to meth. I've already tried Clonazepam with Vyvanse and it takes care of the anxiety part pretty well. All those drugs have a long have life too so maybe they would be synergistic.

I am not giving you, the reader, the privilege of knowing the intent of the heinous act which my blacked out self committed. I struggle to find it meaning behind it. The whole ordeal has negatively effected my mental health up until recently - I realized something in this world. In order to be successful, to have purpose, to truly be alive, you have to own your actions and defend them to the fullest extent of what you are able to comprehend.

It’s the day of a highly anticipated UFC fight, and I find myself on the third day of uncontrolled indulgence. Let’s say it’s around 11 am. One of my frat brothers is helping me bag out some coke so we can sell it at the day party (darty) while also helping ourselves throughout the day. Arriving at the darty with bags of coke and ammonia inhalants, I was beyond stimulated. Shotgunning beers left and right, making a complete mess, and disrespecting my brothers home, I decide to black out with the help of a pathetic looking green hulk that has been in my wallet for too long. After taking the xanax, I only remember bits and pieces. Many, many tragic and cringe events happened that night, but I won’t bore you with that, you’re wondering what the fuck is a xanax poop. 

Fast forward to close to the fight, we’re watching it at a split house with multiple different people in it. I’m asking my friends “lets go home its so late”, and they’re just like “the fight starts in an hour what do you mean”. I thought it was atleast 2am when it was infact 8pm. Well, after I’m telling everyone retarded conspiracies and other incoherent bullshit, I walk upstairs of the house to use the bathroom. Unfortunately the bathroom was on the first floor, so instead of being a civilized human I walk into someone’s room and sit on his couch. The lights are off and I’m just sitting there. Then for some reason the evil inside of me took over. I was told that I broke a few discs, including Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Arc. I steal the rubber joystick off of an Xbox controller, an expensive watch that I immediately put on my wrist, and ripped through this poor man’s wallet. I guess I remembered why I came upstairs, and proceeded remove my pants to defecate on the carpet. 

The next morning, I wake up in my boxers on the floor of my dorm on a mattress pad (?) and my roommates proceed to tell me of the night I had. Remembering what had unfolded, my mind was flooded with remorse and guilt and embarrassment.

I've had a handful of experiences with acid, but I prefer and have had more experiences with shrooms.

My first trip over three and a half years ago was a half 8th. Since then, I've had many different experiences ranging up to 12g (dried). I'm not posting in depth trip reports in this post, but hitting on a phenomenon I've experienced twice.

The first time was on the 12 gram trip. I had worked myself up in increments of 5, 7, 9 and then 12. The trip itself was incredibly challenging to (obviously) say the least. I was doing all of the counter productive things like trying to 'hold myself together', fetal position, even a superman like pose trying to grasp onto the very fabric of reality. At a certain point, on a dose that high, you have to come to terms, accept you're going to die and ""let go"". So after much trauma, I did just that; laid down in my bed and let go both metaphysically and literally. I pissed the bed.

The second experience was with my girlfriend at the time and was actually the first trip I had following the 12g experience. We both took 5g (dried). It was her first time on a dose that high. While going through an incredibly profound experience (one of the most profound I've had) with another human being and also specifically on some level of the male - female dynamic on one of the deepest telepathic levels (obviously not something to attempt to articulate here), she was feeling the intense anxiety that can come with your first experience of 'letting go' like this. She didn't think she was going to survive or pull through, I convinced her otherwise. This lead to us wrapped together in an embrace that merged us into one being. As we relaxed into the embrace, we both simultaneously let go (both metaphysically and literally again) and pissed ourselves on the spot.

Both of these experiences were over two years ago. Since then (recently) I've worked myself back up to 5g (dried). I plan on taking 7g on a solo backpacking trip in the mountains soon and intend to fully let go, whatever that entails. Even though I've been on higher doses, this is uncharted territory for me, both because of the place I'm at mentally and emotionally in my life is as different as it could have ever been and I am going to be doing the 'McKenna Method' which I have never done before. I've always had external stimuli.

I'm really not concerned with the stigma of pissing oneself. I'm going to be camping for two weeks in the mountains when I do this and I would like not to have to sleep in a pissed in sleeping bag for the remainder of my time after my experience.

Wondering if there's anyone out there who's had similar experiences and/or insights into the phenomenon. Also insights into how to deal with the issue of wanting to fully let go, but not worry about pissing my sleeping bag or anywhere else I plan to trip in the future.

We didn’t measure or anything we just made them with leftover cannabutter.

So it started slow and I was just really high and giggly but I was talking to my friend and suddenly it looked like a mirror was in between us and instead of my friend there it was a reflection of me. 

Then all the sudden it seemed like everything was frozen except for me. And I thought everything that was going on was happening in my head and everything was still frozen in real life. (I have no idea if that makes any sense lol) Then I felt like I was just in a loop of trying to tell my friend I was having a bad trip. 

My friend finally convinced me to lay down and try to relax but every time I was starting to relax and fall asleep I was imaging that I was in the process of dying and I had to fight to stay alive and awake. It really felt like a bad acid trip 

By this time I convinced myself that I was having a seizure because of how much I was shaking and I thought everything going on around me was all in my head.

I would take 2 and feel really good and I would do that everyday for a week until I would get Xanax again. Soon after a while after I would take them I would throw up constantly! Like over and over.

IF all goes well this thread will end as a example for visitors alike NOT like you(yes you that is reading this) Everyone one i have met ALL are ""one with god"" connected to each other. then there is me. 

Last night remember having a dream, not anything ""that"" special when suddendly the mood changes and right next to me appear a Toad, yes dark green color and says: Go and ""take"" me now. 

I open my eyes and get what time and what day is now. and think ""not today but tomorrow was first possible day to Trip/roll""what have you"". then close my eyes and Still ""there"" toad divides in maybe four(4) different slices and does this kinda ""salute"" when one is on the knees and w both hands wave èm from up to down.(you know this im sure) and ""tells me"" lets me know that wasnt about NOW but that this was the invitation.. 

I have been ""a bit too carefull"" walking on glass, while preparing to do this, Mainkyk cause ALL/everyone of my ""trip""/ceremony have told that same thing.. im not anything like youre.. 

&amp;#x200B;

So im thinkin about the possibility that this will be my ""ticket to home"" So i ""dont have to"" but i do think about that person that needs to collect my body from the ground. 

\-Throwback to -14 when at my birthday i took my second ayahuasca tea Alone, and was experience deep state of dying. I was Lying on my back and felt vomit burst from my head/mouth etc then i fall to the ground when my wife opened to door(04:45am) GOIN TO WORK and wanted to see how i was and to wish me happy birthday morning.. only to find my all covered in vomit makin odd noise and she was a bit confused. (this has to remain her worst nightmare, thus i have to make sure that If im not coming back, all is taken care of) this is also the reason i cant just ""have some randon (sitter/shaman) there. 

SideNote:

Have crossed the line few times already. but youll get the wrong idea if i write about them.. as you know youre different and thus take such words dirrerently than i meant so. 

Yeah heres the cards that fate has dealt me: 2g GoldFlake Toad Venom (Bufo Alvarius) 5-MeO-DMT 

plan 1:

 5x 220ug LSD

plan 2:

 5g magickMushrooms

plan 3:

nn\_DMT

plan 4:

Kemine 1g

&amp;#x200B;

Before u feel the need to say things like ""pray to god"" we have spoken great many times. and been told nothing but lies. everytime. 

And one time ""they"" contacted me from another dimension and asked me to join hem. Explained that this Universe is dying, but then  God came and asked me to stay. Why would you pray and listen to some one that ONLY tells you lies? 

What am I looking to find time time?

\-Well im quote sure that all will happen with a strong sense of ""this is real, and true, this is not just hallucinationm, not my imagination"" just like with nn\_dmt then later get to realise that all info i was given was false ALL info. 

So im looking to come back one huge experience with me and soon to be disapointed by the knowledge that yet again i have gained info that will turn out to be wrong..

Like when people ""knew"" that earth is the center of the universe.. 

\-I mean when last time took ayahuasca aliens came and forced me to decide ""how is all life gonna end here on earth"".. if this was true then.. well my name will echoe nicely in your minds..

just so i dont get too bored i orederd two grams #3Heroin to mess around.. my dosage is always the same. I get +40 smoking times from one gram. one gram lasts 4 days, give or take..

then yesterday night i decided to eat quite a nice amount of candy, also taking into account my forced tolerance break, and thinking wow i am going to be so high tonight! 
when the edible kicked in, i didnt feel pain at first but as it got more stronger, thats where the mouth pain begin. i had intense cotton mouth, and felt as though all my extraction sites were on fire. i had the worst pain spreading from the part of my jaw where the tooth was, all the way to my ear. my face was swelling, and very sensitive. 
this is probably where i messed up, i got online and looked up edibles in relation to post wisdom teeth removal. i saw 1 reddit post that said do not combine since the intense dryness can lead to a dry socket..although im sure the wound was closed up, all my symptoms pointed to that. 
laying in bed i felt my swollen cheeks and jaw press onto my bottom teeth, and i swear it felt as thought my nerves were being messed with, and i could not stop shaking. it was as though all my body was being affected by the nerves in my mouth. the pain was the worst i have felt in my entire life. i layed there like oh shit how do i explain this to my parents and the dentist, then decided i will sleep and if its not gone by morning i will talk to them. 
morning comes and i wake up with 0 pain. no pain but a very swollen left cheek and jaw. this makes me think ok NOT a dry socket since dry socket pain does not improve in the span of 8 hours. leaves me thinking it is a possible infection, so all of today i’ve been taking my anti-infection medicine (Penicillin VK) and anti inflammatory Ibuprofen to help with the swelling. 

TLDR; the edibles caused cotton mouth which caused my mouth and face INSANE pain, don’t know what the fuck it was but the feeling went away when i was not high anymore. please if u got ur teeth out give it lots of time before using cannabis again. i thought 6-7 days was enough but boy was i wrong",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,682971,public,confidence,self,my experience on edibles after getting 3 wisdom teeth and 1 molar extracted,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gw8zoa/my_experience_on_edibles_after_getting_3_wisdom/,no_ads,0.0,1591268846.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not a DrugNerd, but i like to do my research.   
Dendrobium nobile contains principaly:

  Dendrobin, Denbinobin, Dendramin, Dendrin, Dendrobin, Dendroxin, Nobilin, Nobilonin and several derviates.   


Researching i didnt found any information of why would the cause any effects.   
Even, i found supplements bassed on extractions for excersicing.   


I found that smoking a dose of 130 mg is quite strong, in a trip report, but, also, i found that people eat this extracts, like 600mg per dose.   


Smoking this alkaloids makes them more active?   
Could they be transformed in other psychoactive variations?   


Also, i'm not able to find Dendrobium nobile, and buying extracts 10:1 seems the most ecconomical way.   


Would you be able to smoke this, like hash?

This doesn’t mean I’m stoned 24/7, I usually don’t wake and bake unless I’m completely responsibility-free or have some chores at home that I wanna do while I’m groovy and chilling

Otherwise, I usually smoke before lunch and before dinner, when I am done with any assignments or homework I have, it makes it more rewarding that way, and it allows me to do my work without much slacking off

Monday 8th of June is my bday and I decided to go on a week-ish tolerance break in order to blast off on my birthday!

Today was day one and it was pretty easy, I thought I’d have some sort of withdrawals but I am thankful to say that there were none :)

I’d recommend anyone to look into r/Dynavap and lurk around. It’s my preferred method of smoking and I’ll never return to joints or bongs. I vape around a gram every 8 days or so, and usually like 0.04-0.07 gets me absolutely baked, which is great and saves me a lotta money, and is healthier as well, which is always a good thing

Getting a gram of DMT, 3x 2cb, 5 grams of weed, and a “special gift” from my dealer the day of my birthday so I’m excited for that. I’ve never met him but he’s a chill dude and we text often, I designed his product menu and custom blotter art for him which he’ll be dosing with 275ug😅

Anyways, felt like talking, I’ve been alone in my room for months and I’m bored as shit rn, have an awesome day, and I wish you lead a great life!

I’d go to get my refill, tell the doctor if I’ve had any slip ups, if I did we’d usually discuss it and I’d go on my way. What helped me the most was having a great therapist who was a genuinely nice man, it seemed like he was actually trying to relate to me on a person to person level instead of viewing me as just an addict. Me and the therapist would watch YouTube videos about drugs and discuss our thoughts on it. They also had me go to mandatory meeting, like an AA meeting but with like 10 other opiates users, it really helped me get my story out and know that I’m not alone. 

The only reason I left is because my nurse was a cunt, I had been 5 months sober from opiates and benzos and only slipped up a handful of times with alcohol or weed. She’d always make a huge deal about getting all the weed out of my system. One week my doctor said “stondddd your on the lowest dose of anyone in our program you could probably quit cold turkey no problem, so I want you to try only dosing suboxone once a day instead of 2-3.” Like I said I’d been sober for almost 6 months so I thought it wouldn’t be a problem. Took my subs only once a day all week, went to get my refill Monday, took my piss test and my nurse said “stondddd your buprenorphine level is higher then the naloxone, want to tell me why?” I had no clue so I asked her what she meant “well when your bupe levels are higher then naloxone that only means, your shooting up.” I was pissed and obviously denied it but she wouldn’t fucking listen, all she said was “let me know when you want to come clean”.

Omg. Its like cocaine...

I can't even get off from the pc. Plus I use a game pad with auto aim much better. We are doing missions with my friends and voice chat.

I played many games : witcher 3(3 times maybe), far cry 5(twice), new dawn, TR 2013, csgo, spiderman marvel ps4, Wolfstein 2, rdr2, age of empires, hitman etc.


I always avoided LOL, wow etc. Especially games like wow where people buy items and level up. Knowing its addictive.

I never got soo hooked in any other game, but be aware I never played any real online game where you level upp etc...

Yesterday after sleeping at 4 am playing 15 hours straight it felt euphoric. I know I will develop tolerance real quick. But the pleasure is similar to adhd meds and amps. Not that strong but definitely something!

Also I have been off from porn and Instagram tho they are nothing close..


I also didn't watch TV series the last 9 years because last time I watched i remember I was watching seasons not episodes ;)

I am not like most people. I get hooked very easily to pleasure. That's why I just avoid. Fuck adhd. Really.

Thanks to my various drug experience I won't be playing gta 5 knowing it's a light cocaine for me boosting fake ass dopamine. It's so amazing blowing choppers with rockets like movies omg....

Thanks god I avoided all those wow like games. I understand why people get hooked. Those games must have anti addiction prevention systems

What is the difference between gta 5 and cocaine? Imagine being unemployed and playing gta 5 online whole day everyday and not looking for a job.... The damage you make your life plus your body by not having physical movement.

So here I declare gta 5 online as A DRUG

It feels gooood. But I won't play.

I must study. Lol. I hope I can learn to stop and do things with boundaries and have priorities but with my crazy ass adhd it looks impossible to me, while I'm not medicated plus I don't work out due to virus.

It's a VERY long post, so yea if you read it, cool, if not then I understand completely.

TL;DR: My stupid ass didn't do any schoolwork because of coming down a 3 month long speed (amphetamine) binge, general laziness and procrastination. The excuse for starting amphetamine use is my recent ADD diagnosis without any pharmaceutical treatment available at the moment. It's currently less than 10 hours before I need to show at least some knowledge for a positive mark about the stuff ""we learnt"" during quarantine and half of my reports for the professional subjects I'm taking in my vocational school have to be done by 10.00. It's currently 23.30.

I'd like to start this post with: Fuck this bullshit of a global pandemic. Seriously, fuck this shit all the way possible and a little bit more.

I started the lockdown with just two grams of some really weak speed, a gram and a half of mushrooms tops and half a tab of 1P-LSD. I couldn't even pick up weed before our dear fucking government told us we can't be located on private property if you weren't 18. And fuck my luck, I'm 17 and am born TWO FUCKING DAYS BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS!!

Oh and I should tell that I'm in a vocational school for electrotechnics and I specified in electronics. The school is statistically the toughest school overall in my entire country.

So yea ok at the beginning of the lockdown I was pretty hyped about doing schoolwork in my damn bed, but that lasted for as long as I had that speed, so three days into the quarantine. Ofcourse I fucking do all the damn speed in less than a week, I've been on a 3 month long binge (with a couple of days off and a 12 day cold turkey two weeks before our schools closed). The absolutely unreasonable and completely moronic reasoning behind my binge is that I got diagnosed with a functional degree of ADD, but my dumb, drug addicted selfdestructive personality . I crashed pretty hard and got all kinds of fucked up and so I didn't do any schoolwork. And my stupid ass went and wrote to my psychiatrist about my depression fucking me up again, how my stomach is also fucking up my mental state (I've got severe acid reflux &amp; stomach hernea) and that I want achange in meds.

Yea, so I got prescribed Lyrica on the first try and I used it medicinally, but as I learned about its abuse potential I instantly pushed the dosage up to its ""average"", so 450mg/day theoretically. And so I became focused on the drugs I'm going to consume during this boredom of a lockdown, not how I'm going to spend my days making sure I stay above the surface school-wise as I had a maths reexamination in year 1, because stupid ass me didin't study maths properly in a mostly math-based field of science.

So, I didn't do shit during quarantine, I relied on getting the few grades needed by flunking, cuz all of our grades during quarantine are, of course, acquired online. I didn't even do any of the reports for the professional subjects I needed to, because I was convinced that I've got hard working friends who'll send me the reports, I'll change them  up a bit and get a decent grade for them. But as faith would have it, I'm obviously delusional - either I don't have friends who'll send the stuff or the friends who would send me stuff don't do the stuff.

The pressure started building up about two weeks ago and I went and bought myself the purest speed I could find on the deep web a week ago. I found a guy from my country and I quickly did buisness with him. After my order arrived two days later I instantly dried 3gs out of the 10g of amphetamine paste I ordered and I went ham on the bitch. I felt, no, I FEEL awesome. I feel like a million dollars and I have absolutely no reason for that. I actually have a reason to panic and me terrified out of my mind and be shitting-my-pants level of stressed, the latter of which I am as well.

The reason for me needing to be scared and stressed is that I have to have all of my grades finished by Friday at 17.00. It's currently Wednesday 23.30 as of this number being looked up and tomorrow at 9.00 I'm being graded for half of my subjects. I have NOTHING to show. I have no report and I didn't do a single excercise given after the first week of quarantine. So me, having a big brain decided to procrastinate until literally about 10h before I need to show half of everything I had to turn in and even then I went and wrote this giant ass post.

But yea, I really wish I didn't get super euphoric, the feelings of such immense power and the unholy amount of hornyness, all of which I often mistake for being super concentrated and I always say ""fuck it, I can do the work after this last meat beating session"". These masturbation sessions last for sometime between three and even twelve hours (yes, I've had several 12h long masturbation sessions since a week ago). I hate speed and I love it soo much as well.

I am currently about ten to twelve lines deep and am tweaking as a fucking crackhead. And the only wish I had for today was doing my stuff for school that I'm supposedly turning in in less then ten hours, NOT masturbate and play games all day.

Ok so I have to finish this rant and stop this bullshit of procrastination. Just want to end this with some general advice: speed is too awesome to be consumed for its' (semi-)medicinal properties if you're unorganised, lazy and a generally below average student.

Speed will not do the work for you and you still have to think about what you're doing and actually do the stuff you're supposed to do. This might be obvious for a lot of people here, but I know there are at least some really unresponsible users here, just like me.

Consequently I felt I had nothing left to lose so I ""gave up"", thought ""eff it all"".

So then something happened... erm, confession: I found myself going against a moral that once terrified me with scare-tactic efforts and misinformation affiliated with things like the War Against Drugs, D.A.R.E., the DEA etc.

So I went on a sudden experiential drug binge and in no particular order consumed, *while* sleep deprived: Molly + Klonopin + Nicotine + Nitrous + Caffeine + Weed + Meth + Heroin (+ did I say sleep deprivation too?) - that marathon/combo/binge = MIRACLE. No kidding; I ""felt"" what seems a sorta ""religious event"" might feel like or it ""seemed"" like something miraculous actually happened, idk. ""Godlike"", sublime, mind-blowing. It's sorta ineffable, but wow. Just wow 💛

It seems I might have entered a sort of delirium that ""defied the impossible"".

P.S. I'm not condoning how potentially irresponsible I was about risking my medical health with this binge, that to remember research into harm reduction, combination interactions and safety practices is rule of thumb. And again I was in a low spot in my life anyway and pretty much thought ""eff it all"" so but I had to post for the sake of a sort of inspiration I guess. 💛☮️

Nor am I for or against drug use. I've lived both sides. Resultingly I guess one could say I'm of the opinion that what an adult does with chemicals to their own body for recreational-or-otherwise purposes is their own business as long as they consider/regard any potential consequences. Yada yada.

Background: 24, went through severe depression/OCD last year. Diagnosed OCD since I was 15. Had a childhood of trauma. Was very good through most of college with help of Ashwagandha. If I ever take Ashwagandha for more than 2 months, I start getting fevers.

March 2019: Severe OCD/depression, could not read/function/interact/write/follow what was happening in a game (board of video game). This has MUCH improved. Moved and had different obsessions (usually around injustice/child abuse/societal issues). Testosterone tested: 150 (scale 300-1000 or something)

Now: Moved to Austin. Always have something to distract me (Podcast, etc.). However, I still have cognitive difficulties (extreme brain fog, no sense of urgency, feeling exhausted always, which I know was from extreme HPA overactivation, I could feel my brain burning lol). I've tried several medications (won't go into the list) but I have a plan to get better over the summer. I was a server before COVID-19 and now I only work 2 days a week. Financially, I am okay right now. No significant stressors, just messed up brain from long term stress.

Starting TMS tomorrow. I know I can ask my doctor, but wondering if you guys have any input on this plan.

**Medical: TMS &amp; Testosterone Replacement**

**Smoothie:**

* Banana
* Coconut Oil – healthy brain fats
* PB - healthy brain fats
* Greek Yogurt – probiotics
* BOS

**Bag of Stuff:**

* Vegan powder – tons of amino acids (all your body needs) and protein
* Chia seeds – healthy brain fats
* Turmeric – reduce inflammation
* Lions Mane – neuroprotection/increases connection between different parts of brains
* NAC 2g – reduces anxiety/anxious thoughts (OCD)
* Magnesium – muscle relaxant/anxiety
* Gynostemma – adaptogen, helps balance stress system
* Maca – increase testosterone, adaptogen
* Passion Flower – increases GABA/makes you calm
* Vitamin C – antioxidant/immune boost
* Cinnamon – antioxidant/immune boost
* Resveratrol – antioxidant/immune boost
* Phosphatidylserine – crashes cortisol (take this at night)
* Mucuna Puriens – increases dopamine/pleasure chemicals
* Milk Thistle - help liver out

**Pills:**

* Multivitamin (forever) – methylated for better absorption (life-extension 2 per day, best brand/price/efficacy)
* Fish Oil (forever) – good brain fats
* Black Currant Oil – brain fats/anxiety
* NSI 189 (3 months) – cognitive boost/depression help
* Ibudilast (3 months) - deactivate microglia
* Ashwagandha (1 month) – best adaptogen in the world imo
* Rhodiola (2 months) – adaptogen/raises serotonin
* Minocyline (200mg) (4 months) (June 15-October 15) - deactivate microglia
* Lamictal (150mg) (3 months) (June 15-September 15), already on this, titrating up

From my understanding, none of these will increase the risk of seizure from TMS.

I know this is a LOT but my brain and body health have gone through some SERIOUS stress the past year and I do not want to keep suffering or dealing with long term brain issues. Life is long, I am young, and I don't want to be stuck in this head and body. Doing everything I can to change it. I have many people I love and care about and I want to get back to being healthy for them. Thank you \*SO\* much for any help you can provide. As an aside, I also made a huge routine of when I'm doing things. I am sleeping 8 hours a night again and spend most of my days doing low stress/out of my head activities, like reading, watching movies, staying off of Reddit/news/catastrophizing, walks outside with podcasts on, calling family and friends.

I also used shrooms to get out of the WORST of the depression/OCD and it helped bring me above water enough to read without ruminating (ugh, my brain). May want to use this in the future and will ask my TMS doctor about it.

That night he introduced me to ketamine and I didn’t really start using drugs for a while. I used to hang out with him all the time and he’d light up a J and offer me some. I’d take it and I would only smoke weed when with him and so my tolerance was next to none. Months went by and I guess both him and the drugs filled a hole in my life. He was my first real friend. He treated me like a human, like a person and the drugs sort of numbed every other pain. This is where they ruined my life. I am an intellectual guy (A* student etc). I started buying my own drugs and experimenting. It got to a point where I didn’t really dig being sober. Every day without weed I’d find another way to chase off sobriety. I’d find some drug in my house, my cupboards, my garden before I got too conscious. I can proudly say that I smoke weed every 3-4 days amongst other things on the weekend but I eat well, drink a lot of water , I exercise daily and I feel like I can use drugs as more of a tool than a fun high.

I’ve used xtc, speed and coke before but never at the same night. On Sunday, 3 days ago I had a rave party and stupidly ended up doing all three of them in the same night(about 6 lines of speed 1 line of coke and 1,5 xtc pills divided by quarters over the night) . No issues at the time and I felt perfectly fine.

The next day I noticed my sleep was being disrupted all the time, I’d fall asleep and suddenly awake in a small shock. ( the same feeling you get when you feel you’re falling when falling asleep and then wake up shocked)

Yesterday as the night was approaching I felt myself getting really drowsy, my eyes felt tired and my head as well somehow. I could feel myself slipping into a state of sleep paralysis (half awake/half sleeping) and with very much anxiety and increased heart race. I could feel my head tingling every time I’d get this sleeping episode. 

It went to a point where I had to keep myself awake by eating loads of sugar, putting my head in cold water, exercising, listening to loud music, and even with this It was hard for me not to slip in that frightening sleep paralysis stage.( it’s frightening bc I can feel myself lose control over my body) At some point I even felt it coming over me when I was standing up and I was shouting at myself to stay awake. All the time fighting it and not knowing what would happen if I’d gave into it cause i got really scared.

The same thing is starting to happen now again and I’m not sure if I fucked up my brain w the drugs or what is wrong. Really regretting the irresponsible choice of mixing drugs and hating the anxiety and state of feeling/being I’m getting in rn. 

Question: did anyone experience extreme disruptions in their sleep/head like this after mixing drugs?

So I've had it sitting here for about a week. Decided to take one yesterday cause why not. We had already used my scale and weighed out the doses. Each capsule contains approx .10 mg. 

Before I ate the capsule I had actually taken a tiny shroom. It was less than a .1 mg. I'm well experienced with mushrooms. I had also tried 4 HO MET before once. So I didn't really think it would be significant. 3:20 PM
I had a light breakfast consisting of only 2 eggs and a piece of bread. I wanted to keep it minimal but also get some nutrition in. Once I'm tripping I won't be able to comprehend hunger anyway. Took the capsule down with a glass of water and instantly felt the shroom flavor for a second. It was the ultra microdose I took earlier. 4 HO on the other hand tastes really bitter.

For me it was like a muscle relaxant at first and didn't really give me much of a shroom vibe. Felt kinda slow. Laughed alot. I was texting my friends in the group chat during the come up. 

4:55 PM
It was starting to resemble shrooms alot more but it's not exactly the same. It's got it's own unique feel to it. The body high was getting a bit intense. Put my glasses on and saw a paper that's on a drawer start stretching. Went to go lay down to see CEVs but also because the load of the drug was overwhelming now. Not quite there in terms of internal visuals but getting there. My friends were discussing serious topics while I was trying to engage in the conversation. Texting nonsense like ""I wanna jam him the muffin mushroom man"".

5:12 PM
""Who wants to take a rip with me. Come further with me to oblivion"" 
That's what I told my friends. Also pretty accurate and a testament to why mixing weed with psychs is always a mixed bag. 
""My brains glitching. It feels it's raining inside my brain."" 
What the fuck is happening? It feels like my vision is getting more yellow. I'm now extremely confused. The visuals are getting stronger. My environment looks warped and all fucked up. Sounds are insane. It's like my dynamic range in hearing has increased. I'm hearing so many sounds at the same time separately. Hearing the birds chirping outside my window and the wind combined with the music I'm playing. 

6:22 PM
""My mind feels like its going to explode. That weed hit made this extremely unsettling. Thoughts so erratic. It feels like doom. Bad thoughts bad thoughts. Ok I'm not having a good time anymore my dudes.""
That was after smoking a bowl. It fucked up the high for me for a bit. But I laid down clutching my pillow and groaning. The internal visuals were kind of there. My mind went blank. I opened my eyes and it was fine. It seems alot easier to get yourself out of a bad thought loop. So that wasn't too bad. Moments later I was back to pissing myself laughing at stupid shit.

9:30PM
Lost track of time cause I was texting friends while I was tripping. It settled down so I smoked another bowl. This time it wasn't bad. I just layed down and took in all the closed eye visuals. These ones were like fine oil paintings of abstract art. Shroom CEVs to me are fast paced and full of bizarre shapes and impossible geometric patterns that dont make sense for any human to write about. They are always constantly changing and it feels like a full frontal assault of colors. 4 HO MET CEVs are chill and slower, allowing you to embrace the visual art. Its alot more artistic and grounded in some form of reality. For something that is completely synthesized it feels more human. Man made. Like a painting. Where shrooms it feels like what you are seeing come from a different reality altogether. It gets cosmic on a grand scale like one time I was seeing a Hindu god levitating over Salvidore Dahli's melting clocks. The Peristence of Time. It feels like something that's out of the planet. 4 HO MET is like letting your mind run free and its centre is imagination. You are the artist holding the pen writing out your own destiny. Even though it feels completely hopeless and it doesn't feel real. I'm walking in a desert. The sun has a face. It's so bizarre and exaggerated. I can find an image similar to it... 
It had a three dimensional structure but it was drawn right into the sky. It's like I could almost feel it. That's how vivid it was for me.

Had my first joint and enjoyed the high too much, I just wanted to be high all the time. I was damaged and drugs somehow fixed me, I felt better on them. 

Then came in benzos, stimulants, psychedelics in my next teen years, psychedelics were helpful tho. I loved them all and couldn’t imagine my life without them. I started relying on drugs to function, had depression and anxiety which only drugs could mask. I started spending all my money in drugs, had no job, lived with my parents, was failing school, had poor health, gave no shits about anything other getting my high from whatever drug I could get. 

During my late teen years I had no social life, lacked passion in life, didn’t understand the point of living, I became distant from my loving and caring family, almost failed my education but all that mattered was that I could get high tonight and tomorrow . 

It all changed when I became addicted to synthetic weed. That showed me that drugs aren’t all sunshine’s and rainbows but they can be real nasty too. I was heavily addicted to that shit, I wanted to quit but withdrawals wouldn’t let me. BUT last November when I was 19 I finally built the courage to quit that shit all alone, I knew I had to be strong and change my life from going to hell. 

I could feel the withdrawal for 3 weeks but it was worth it. 

I then started spending more time with my family, started focusing on my education, now I’m successfully completing my Diploma and applying for an elite art school for next year. I’ve become more happy, can manage my depression and anxiety more without drugs, gripped more control over my life and getting more out of it. I’ve got goals and dreams now which I’m trying to achieve, can concentrate better, have enormous motivation &amp; passion and my life is generally much better then what it was before in all aspects! 

I still love drugs but I now choose to do them very occasionally. Like smoking 2-4 joints in a month only when I wanna relax, do mdma every 3-4months and maybe lsd every 3-4 months. I’ve realised that drugs should be done occasionally and it’s better to focus on your sober life more! 

Thanks for listening!

Hey Reddit,

I was cleaning up my hard drive and stumbled across a short story I wrote for a Creative Writing class back in college. It has a lot to do with being a lazy college kid doing drugs, and uses a lot more too-flowery language during the trip scene than I remember. Somehow I was comfortable reading this to the class!

Bored with Quarantine, so I figured I would post it and maybe the story could bring a few laughs to some other people in the same boat.

So the first night I start my bender is 90% of the times being in a club and the most exciting thing is getting to the speed as it's really hard to get to these days. After getting speed I freshen up with my pals and we start there. Everything goes smooth in the club and that night until we hit the after. As I do more and more speed my tongue goes crazy! I don't know how or why but during the years I have developed this ""tick"" where my tongue pushes a tooth because I get paranoid that it will fall out so I push it inside with my tongue every 5 seconds. That ""tick"" left with me until now. Whether or not I will push my tooth. Another thing that left with me when on speed is my jaw is developing a click sound when I walk and it's really annoying, but I heard that is common when on amphetamines also bruxism is not frequent but it happens. People always say they get skinny when actively doing amphetamines but my body asks for food 2x times more then when I'm sober. I don't really know why but it happens every-time I'm on a bender. The scariest trips I got on speed is when I gotten into my five days with no sleep for the first time. It was really scary to have visual hallucinations. They only occurred when I was alone and with no music around me. I start developing faces on items, plants and anything really.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,682884,public,confidence,self,Tripping on speed,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gvyxj1/tripping_on_speed/,no_ads,0.0,1591236134.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

it came on pretty fast. within 15 minutes i felt really giggly and i couldn’t put proper sentences together. after 45 minutes everything is a blur. my other friend who we were with who was drunk had to leave so we had no one to watch us. his carpet had this weird design that made it look like there were people in it and they danced in a weird way. i had been able to be awake i guess you could say and still be able to function while my friend had been completely out of it. he started saying “dad?” like his parents were calling his name. he also threw scissors at the ceiling and pretended to be a cat which was pretty fucking hilarious. we both weren’t having a good time. when the come down came we were able to have conversations with each other. the come down was actually very nice and peaceful. we put on some video games and got some food. the sun finally came up and we were able to be a little sober. after awhile of just sitting around, my friend decided to go upstairs to get more food. in a matter of minutes his mom and dad comes downstairs with my friend asking me why their kid was acting so weird. i tried to act dumb and lie but he was making it way to obvious that he was tripping still. his parents talked to us and his dad told me he was gonna take me home. 

he talked to us more and my friend finally fessed up that we’d done acid. he eventually told my dad and i’d been grounded for awhile because he also found out i’d been smoking weed for the past year. i think the trip would’ve been a lot cooler if we didn’t get caught or if we had a trip sitter. there was a lot of stuff i did wrong so the experienced people in this subreddit are prolly gonna yell at me.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,682882,public,confidence,self,help needed,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gvyui5/help_needed/,no_ads,0.0,1591235891.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1591209141.0

In this first week, my brother was in active addiction, using heroin everyday. He had struggled with addiction for 10 years, on methadone replacement therapy for the past 7, and still using crack and heroin.  After our second group session, he overdosed and nearly died. He checked himself into rehab voluntarily that week and decided to stop taking his methadone. 

Today he is clean, he's been off methadone for 34 days, and hasn't used crack or heroin. He credits the group with providing him the structure he needs to succeed. Some people may think its crazy for an addict to use *drugs* to help overcome their destructive behaviors. But his story is a testament to the fact that drugs are just tools. The result depends on how we use them. Thank you for reading.

We created a podcast if anyone is interested in hearing more about the structure.

I love acid to bits and use it quite a lot recreationally, I've never had any life changing trips that changed my forever or anything, I'm still the same asshole that I was before I dropped my first tab.

I'm in no way saying these drugs can't be life altering, they clearly have the potential but just because a person drops acid or takes some shrooms it does not mean their problems will be fixed.

I should add that I'm not from the US. Don't know why but it feels necessary.

I (18f) have two older brothers (23 and 26m) who since I was young -about 8-10 y/o?- have been dealing and have used my apartment as the place to cut and sell all the stuff. The reason is that my mom is always working because we're lower class. I used to see her about 10 min a day (before school) except for her off-day which was Sundays. The rest of the time my house was filled with drugs, paraphernalia and dealers.

This fucked me up a little bit. It went on for about 6 years according to my shitty memory. I barely remember anything consistently form that period of time, just some key moments or whatever. Sometimes memories come back to me and I have to spend a few hours alone cause they were kinda shitty.

The dealers were in total about 50? maybe. Maybe not all of them were dealers, I don't remember. Usually there were only about 9 of them in my house at the same time, with abt 3 of them being there everyday and the rest alternating.  They were sketchy, and i don't want to say just how much because I'm still afraid of cops showing up. But just imagine, I guess. You'd cross the street if you saw them walking towards you.

One of my brothers had anger issues and would abuse me emotionally and physically, almost killed me once. My other brother and the dealers (who would spend all day in my house and I almost saw them as older brothers too, kinda syndrome-of-stockholm-ish) would just watch and add to the verbal stuff. But they would bring me gifts too, which at the time felt good, like chocolate bars and stuff. They would leave them under my pillow, in my bedroom, which looking back creeps me out a lot and I have a lot of problems with my privacy now

Police was around a lot, cause I live in a sketchy street. I would see people come home beat up after police brutality attacks a lot. Cops knocked on my door a few times and we had running jokes about them.

There is more to it, but it was overall kinda weird. It wasn't a common way for a kid to be raised. Today I look back and feel like it was normal, but when I tell my friends what to me are ""funny anecdotes"" from that period they look worried and don't laugh, which is shitty. It's not like they can relate to it. I'm not from a ""hood"" or whatever you want to call it. It wasn't a gang. I don't know anybody with a similar experience to mine, and I don't see it on tv either. I can only relate to rap music in that way.

I guess I just wanted to let that out. I'm in a much better place now, as one of my brothers moved out, and my mother isn't working as much. But it still hits me sometime and I can't tell anybody about it. Not even my friends. This is the deepest I've gone into it ever I think.

I'm a bit fucked in the head now. I think too much about it. About what would have happened if one of the dealers was a pervert, or what if the police caught them, or if someone robbed us, or shot us. It's the worst thing that has happened to me, even with my father dying when I was 14.

I feel like I'm being a little bitch for letting it affect me, and that I should be tough like rappers and thugs from movies are. I guess I just wanna say be careful if you're dealing with kids around. I kinda wanna know if anyone has similar experiences. It would help me a lot.

I was foolish and uneducated/irresponsible, and obviously I see that now. I was absolutely not in a good mindset, having failed my driving exam earlier that same day and it was late in the night, and I took a 200ug tab of acid, my first time trying LSD. I thought that having a tripsitter, a close friend would help, however I almost immediately fell into intense psychosis and had to be wrestled and choked out multiple times by my friend as I was vomiting onto myself and attempted to commit suicide with a smashed beer glass, another foolish oversight. I was scratching and cutting my friend up the whole time, luckily he is of much larger build than myself. How the police and ambulance were not called is beyond me.

The bad trip lasted around 8 hours and initially I had no recollection of what had happened. As time has passed and I have used other drugs that used to have no ill effects, I have pieced together what I experienced. Long story short it started with me thinking I was stuck in an endless loop (which I have found to be a common effect of bad trips) to me thinking I would be born again and that I would have to live another life with all the memories and knowledge from this current life, etc.

No anchors that my friend tried and had established helped. We played a track that we were familiar with, which I took to be part of the loop due to its repetitive beat, a watch that I had received as a gift from my relatives from Korea which I scratched up and smashed into the tiling and a repeated phrase which I had decided on (""cool, calm and collected""). Foolishly, we had no anxiolytics or antipsychotics to cancel the trip, as it is very difficult and situational to obtain the more potent types off-label in Australia.

All was well the next day, and after a shower and some new clothes I was basically myself again, and the only seemingly remaining side effects were some thoughts not registering as fictional in my head, which resolved over the next few days/weeks.

After a long hiatus from casual drug usage to focus on studies and exercising well, I have started to occasionally smoke a few joints and use MDMA (tested and from reputable, close personal sources). However, this is where a few problems have surfaced. When smoking a decent amount of cannabis, 1 and a half or 2 joints/cones, the same visions and ideas from the bad trip have begun to resurface. A couple of times I have momentarily lost my sense of reality, and with drugs like poppers this effect is very noticeable, and each time I have been able to recover without experiencing psychosis. It feels almost like free diving and almost drowning but making it back to the surface in time, the problem would be if I were to actually 'drown'. Of note is that I have not used LSD since the incident. 

I am in a much better mindset now, and my education on various substances is markedly better than that time. Has anyone had any experience with recurring feelings similar to those of bad trips, and is there some kind of exercise that helps to avoid or remove these urges/experiences?

TL;DR: Rode out a bad trip and now, about a year or so later, whenever I take a decent dosage of a substance the same feelings begin to rear up.

Anyways I’m an experienced tripper who really enjoys a good trip. Normally I take 4-6 tabs of acid when I do trip. I get the cartoonish look and the 3D outlines and I’m cool with it. Nothing during tripping has ever sent me off into a dark place like this one has. Anyways it was night time and I was by myself. I decided it was a good time to trip being that I wasn’t under any pressure or stress. I do the norm 6 tabs. I smoke a blunt for the come up and all is well. The creases in the wall were dancing the room had a light green tent to it I was listening to music and everything was good. About 2-3 hours into the trip I came across lil Wayne’s song Don’t cry. I absolutely fell in love with it and the walls and stuff were moving with the music. Eventually I was coming down and usually I smoke a blunt for the comedown. I woke my brother up out of his sleep to see if he wanted to smoke with me. 


Anyways we roll up the blunt and get to smokin. Almost immediately it didn’t feel right but I pushed it off as my mind messing with me cause I’m coming down. We get all the way done and at this point I’m gone. My mind started like tripping out and such and my brother kept asking if I was ok. I nonchalantly walked out of the room to go use the restroom. I ended up lookin in the mirror and my face like lifted straight up off of me and that completely freaked me tf out. So I hurry up and rush back to my bedroom and tried to calm myself down. I started thinking crazy things like that people were making fun of me (mind you everybody but my brother is asleep and he is in the shower) and i started knowing then an there that I was having a bad trip. I try calming myself down and it was nearly impossible. I turned on the tv some family guy thinking this will help and laid down. This only proceeds to extend my worry as like it’s not gonna work. So I sit up on the end of my bed and I started hearing this loud grinding noise that still haunts me to this day. The furniture in my room started picking up and moving all around my room and this only furthered my panic. Naturally I ran to my brothers room and get him up. This is my other brother and he is fast asleep in the dark room. I seen so many stuff in those walls that I can’t even unsee anymore.

I had also just taken an 8 day tolerance break from all drugs. 


Saturday evening- 300mg of DXM along with weed. Great trip, very introspective and I also thought I fried my brain at some points lol. 


Sunday- Phenibut (2.5gs) in the morning, weed throughout the day. Chill day and afterglow was dope, I also fasted today. 

Monday- Weed and phenibut (2gs) early, Kratom (6gs) in the middle of the day, and about 5grams of shrooms at the end along with cacao to potentiate it (cacao has mild maoi properties). This trip was insane on every account, I am very analaytical and try to remain objective because I appreciate the science behind drugs. Take what I am about to say however you guys wish, I do not like to lie about these things. At one point in the peak of the trip, my gf (who was tripping on 300ug of acid) placed her fingers on my third eye when she noticed that I was stressed. Upon placed them there, I began to feel possessed (for lack of a better word for this experience) with bliss and laughter, oh the laughter, it couldn’t stop and I was aware of the laughing, but had no control over it. It felt like I was watching my body act independently and I began to convulse, vomit rushed halfway up my mouth as I gargled on it, but I was in total bliss and still laughing. My girlfriend held me down and continued to hold her finger on my third eye the whole time. I eventually came back to control my body after being in a blissed limbo state and I found that my body was in the position of a cross and my ankle was over my other ankle (sound familiar?). Now, I am not implying anything other than that this was by far the most insane psychedelic moment of my life. I felt total bliss and oneness. 



Tuesday- Kratom and weed. Meditation and return to healthy eating, no phenibut.

He had said it wasn't a proper trip and although we had moments that I would describe as powerful moments where I genuinely felt that our energies were just entwined I remember us saying to each other at one point it felt like we were cuddling laying as a big mess of worms but all together like we were our own entity in the world. 
I remember opening up to him about my true feelings regarding a mutual friend of ours who unfortunately committed suicide. (Nothing that would be wierd for a partner to hear as it wasnt that kind of feeling) I was telling him about how some of my best memories from my childhood were spent with this friend of ours before I moved away. I'm quite a spiritual person anyway so I will often think of my friend and think of him as looking down on me and out for me like hes still around? But I've never spoken to anyone about it out loud.
I remember talking to him about our relationship telling him about how i felt we would always be together and how we would always find each other that we were cosmically joined. That from the moment we met years ago I fell in love with him and although we spent time apart I always felt drawn back to him and that I was glad we made it this far and that I felt we would always be together now and have each others backs. Basically i had just such a massive outpouring of love and joy which is good which is what I wanted and what I was enjoying. 


THEN. I vaguely remember we started to get sexual which can be  abit of a sore spot for us anyway as I have a massively overactive sex drive due to my OCD. Where as my partner has what is probably considered a more normal sex drive. 
Things got wierd. My partner began saying that the trip was wrong? and we should be floating together and that we weren't tripping properly he kept saying I was confused and I felt he was. Basically it seemed we just both got worried about each other he said it's because we didnt take enough and because we had taken diazepam earlier that day so he took a sleeper because he said we were at some weird anxiety bit and we werent gonna get past it and would keep rolling in and out and he just wanted to sleep. But he wouldnt let me take the sleeper because we are in a hotel accommodation at the moment (really not the ideal environment In retrospect) and housekeeping were supposed to be coming today and it's a bit non negotiable. I told him we should wait it out tidy what we could chill out have a bath and then take the sleeper so we wouldnt have any issues with house keeping. As we have to actually usually leave the room when they come in. 

Fair enough I've never done acid before but I felt like I had this amazing powerful love outpouring and then like I dunno like he abandoned me. I wasn't finished rolling in and out yet and he just fell asleep and left me to deal with all of the staff. Who freaked me out themselves talking about landlords coming to see us and things like that. I tried to keep myself grounded breathing going outside barefoot (it's a technique I developed during my most anxious times the earth on my bare feet makes me feel less anxious) I tried to wake him several times told him over and over that the landlords would be round today. We needed to get him up and about. And he just didnt wake up so I've not slept yet really I've had a hot shower to calm me a bit but I just feel so abandoned and dejected today and now He's gone out to his friends  I'm just feeling well; even more detached. 

I've got myself some sugary food and I've put some chill music on I've been outside I'm currently laying in a room with soft lighting and curtains drawn and some chilled rap on (chance the rapper; wu tang phoniks; some biggie and pac hybrids) and I'm just sort of trying to come back to reality as such but I just feel kinda empty. 

Before he left the hotel he kept saying he didnt understand what was wrong and I dont know how to explain to him how I feel. 


To be honest I've probably just wrote this more for myself to feel a bit more grounded but anyone more experienced that can shed some light or advice or even make sense of it all then I'd be happy to hear it.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,682843,public,confidence,self,First time acid; advice I guess?

I dropped sometime around 7pm or so, and the comeup from 8 to about 9 was endless smiles and positivity. I was laying in my bed with a mostly dark room, except for a tiny lamp that just barely shone light onto the popcorn ceiling above my bed. I had music playing, both earbuds in, and noticed white geometric shapes dancing around and coming outside of my ceiling. As the number of shapes and patterns grew it became slightly harder to breathe, not necessarily respiratory depression, but it was like I was trying so hard to hold in tears of joy, as if I was witnessing the most beautiful event humanity has ever seen. The patterns just enveloped my vision, and then they went from white to whiteish blue, and I pretty much forgot everything. I was just this being that life's energy was endlessly flowing through. The closest thing I could relate it to is the album art for Elite by Within the Ruins.

He is staying in my bedroom while I am in my partner's room/office space. Late at night and early in the morning we keep hearing the clicking sound of a lighter coming from my room and I am worried he is doing drugs in my room. This concerns me for two reasons:
A) if something is burning then he is going to make my room and all my possessions smells gross (it's not a big space). But more importantly,
B) We are very Liberal (we openly smoke weed regularly and do other drugs recreationally) so if this is something that he feels the need to hide from us then it must be something really bad for him and that is deeply concerning as he has recently been in a very bad place psychologically.
I was hoping that someone might be familiar/ able to work out what substance he is using so I know what we are dealing with and where to go from here. I think it must be something small as there is no obvious pipe laying around and when I walked into my room after hearing the clicking earlier, I spotted something that looked like a rag or a sheet of rubber in his hand that he proceeded to screw up and tighten his fist around so I couldn't see it.
I don't know what to do as he has lied to me about doing drugs before (we used to live together and he would be acting so strange and hysterical but refuse to admit he has taken anything ) but everything about this is screaming red flags at me.

I am a 23Yo, 5.6, and almost underweight.

12-25, Dosed 80mg,

01-25, Slight palm sweat, a bit of stomach discomfort that went away, heart rate 91 bpm feeling a wonderful body high, very relaxed and my thoughts slow down and see things differently compared when I am sober, heart fluctuating between 80Bpm to 95, music sounds really good, some classical masterpieces or pretty much any music I like I feel them at an emotional level like falling in love sort of thing so far so good.

&amp;#x200B;

2-00 to 4-00, Music appreciations keep increasing as time goes on, feeling a great wave of euphoria overall feeling really, really good, pupils dilated, hear rate at averaging 102Bpm. I don't feel weird and awkward as I usually am, this time actually wants to speak with people instead and love doing it, feeling great.

5-00 to 7-00, peaking nicely, I call my family and talk to them and have great joy in doing so, I keep conversations going and feeling really good still.

After 7, I feel it sort of coming down and wearing off.

10-00, coming down, feeling a bit cold but still positive,

At midnight, things turned to normal, so to aid my sleep I took 5mg of diazepam (Valium) and slept well for over 15 hours. 

The day after I felt normal, I drank water, ate well went for a walk got back home, went to sleep so far everything normal.

The second day after no problem at all, feeling awkward and weird, and back to my normal antisocial and keeping conversations to a very minimum.

This is my personal experience with 6-APB, it was a wonderful time, while on 6-APB I was a completely different, positive, loving person, talking to strangers even, something I never do, confident and very charismatic. WHY JUST WHY do I have to take drugs like this to feel this way but many thanks to the gentleman who created this beautiful substance.

I know this isn't healthy but this test is really important for school and even the littlest improvement could matter. So what would be the best approach. Also I don't usually do sports, but I'm still better than the average person.

Bear in mind, most people looking for any kind of transformative experience don't even consider taking this small a dose because it's basically a hefty microdose. I certainly wasn't expecting this.

4/19/20
It was bicycle day but no one I was with really felt like tripping so I just took a small dose in honor. The majority of the trip itself was pretty uneventful until the very end, but it was still a nice day spent hanging out with my friends at the river. Now, normally LSD and weed do not mix well for me because it tends to bend reality a little too much for my comfort. But if I'm well into the comedown, it's usually fine.

Later that night laying in bed, I was feeling pretty much back at baseline but was having trouble falling asleep, so I went downstairs to smoke some weed. Apparently this was too soon. 

When I went back to lay down in bed, reality got real fluid, real quick. Within a few minutes, my reality started to wobble and churn as if it were somewhere between a liquid and a gas. The vague patterns I was percieving in my minds eye started to solidify and come through this suddenly less stable reality. It's as if 3D reality began to get less dense and I could suddenly see through it into a higher dimension. Like a higher dimension that was superimposed on top of, through, and behind the familiar 3D one. I started to see wormholes coming through this new higher dimension and it somehow felt more real and significant than the one I had come from (and was still half way in)

It's a little unsettling when the reality you've accepted your whole life feels like an illusion. However, reality dissolving experiences were not new to me so I knew what to do; I knew not to fight it, and to just let go. I started to meditate to cope with the anxiety and discomfort that came with it. As soon as I began to relax, I felt my emotions as a physical substance in my body that I was able to control. I tend to hold most of my tension in my stomach so I directed my focus toward that area. Moments later I was literally pulling my emotions out of my stomach with my mind, into this higher dimensional space. As I did so, they would condense into geometric objects in front of me, where I could then play with and mold them into whatever I liked. I was transmuting negative emotions into positive ones with just my will. I've never experienced such tangible, immediate healing, and at such a small dose it blew my mind. This whole time I'm still aware I'm laying in bed. I know I'm usually pretty sensitive to drugs but Jesus Christ. 

I think over the years I have learned how to navigate the psychedelic space and I'm able to get the most out of not much. Maditation and learning how to control your energy seems to be the key for maximizing the psychedelic experience, at least for me.

This turned out to be a very positive experience for me, but I guess as a PSA to be careful when you mix LSD and weed, it's not the most deterring story. I actually don't want to deter anyone though, I just want to encourage people to be cautious. I attribute me not losing my shit mostly to the low dose, as I have other stories with the same combo at higher doses that weren't so mellow (like thinking my entire life had been someone else's schizophrenic hallucination, looping amnesia, losing the ability to comprehend English, ego death, etc..) and I mean that I've never taken more than a tab and a half when I say ""higher dose"". Just be careful when mixing substances in general, even if there is no physically dangerous interaction. Specifically with acid, even if you're a daily stoner, that shits different when you're tripping. Plenty of people are fine with this combo, but some aren't and I've noticed a correlation specifically between LSD, Cannabis, and losing grip on reality, not just with myself, but several friends and other people across the internet as well. I personally always wait until the comedown now. Just take it easy with the weed at first. If everything's still good after one hit then keep it up 👍 but I think knowing this could prevent a lot of bad trips",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,682802,public,confidence,self,Emotional Alchemy (Never underestimate the power of LSD + Weed),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gvqkbf/emotional_alchemy_never_underestimate_the_power/,no_ads,0.0,1591204344.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are spiritual beings on this planet with an opportunity to experience a mortal life
It's all a game, have fun with it.
The mothership sends us souls to this planet who they feel worthy of. They are awareness or just isness working through us.
Due to karmic principles some souls end up looping on this planet for lifetimes until they hit a state of awakening, In which they can break the cycle.
We are in a vessel known as our body and here to fulfil certain life missions for the betterment of mother earth. If we aren't working for the betterment, we are contributing to the lag of our planet.
This month (June) is a special time on this planet apparently [probably cause it's the month I'm born in haha]. I've never felt more alive. I feel I am a fungi on this rock. Our energy is like spores interacting with nature and accordingly manifestating into realities based on our intentions. Each thought we have fractulizes. Where thought goes, energy flows. Love is all encompassing and necessary for the survival of this planet. Science is a way to understand nature, a way to connect back to the mothership or try deduce an explanation for it. The nature of our excistance is musical, the whole solar system is singing and we are singing/vibrating with it into infinity (Aum/Om). Nature repeats cycles (death/rebirth) and works through geometry which can be understood better.  To realize that we are stardust on this floating rock, connected to everything thing on a subatomic level is enlightening and can really make us wonder what our purpose is on this rock. Once a being hits this self realized state, it becomes they're mission to help others reach it as well. We aren't really ever born or die, we are just passing by.

I’ve had an easy life, my parents are still together, I have a nice house in a nice suburb, I go to a private school, no religion is forced on me by anybody, I get good grades.

Socially, I’m a wreck. I can’t help but feel like a fat shit where everybody sees me as an annoying piece of shit. I’ve felt like this for 5 years, some days I just don’t know, scared to got to school to ruin my already fucked up reputation. Too scared to go to school or even out of school therapists because of the fact they’ll tell my parents, who’ve already told me that I’m fine and there’s nothing to be upset about. I also can’t bear telling a therapist my emotions, because I’m scared they’ll make me feel like shit for complaining when I have it perfect in life. My parents constantly call me the laziest, most useless shit on the planet, and if I don’t pick up my grades, and stop complaining about how shit my day was they’ll stop wasting their money and send me to a public school. My few friends go to this school, and my social anxiety would prevent me from making anymore. 

However this all changes when I’m under the influence of drugs. When I’m on drugs such as dextroamphetamine, I feel like I’m longer annoying to everybody around me, I feel happy in my body, I’m not moody. I actually study in class and use time wisely rather than study last minute for a test. I come home and talk about the positives of my day rather than the negatives.

The first day I took dextroamphetamine, I thought my life had changed forever. After a good day at school, I actually took my dog for a walk to the gas station, positively interacted with everyone I walked past and bought a chocolate bar, and some chips and walked home. It seemed my social anxiety had completely gone away, my lack of care and my laziness went away and I did jobs and stuff I needed to.

The first time I tried Weed, I felt as if all my problems temporarily were lifted, it helped me to look at the bigger picture, that I’m just stardust floating through space, with literally no purpose, true freedom. 

The first time I tried opioids, in particular Tapentadol and Codeine, I felt natural in my own body. I KNOW I’m not super overweight (73kg at 5”9), but I literally cannot help but feel I’m the fattest shit alive with no hope. This changed when I was high. I felt healthy and natural, for the first time in a while I said no to any junk food for dinner and did a work out in my home gym. 

I no longer have access to Opioids, and looking back on the dangers of opioids and addictive properties, I’m glad I don’t. But these drugs make me feel as if I was a kid again, back when socially I had nothing to worry about. Back in the easier days. 

I’m young, in my teens. I won’t say how young, but it’s on the younger side. I know it’s probably a “phase” and I probably seem like a complete idiot to a lot of you.

My parents are against drugs strongly, due to my older sister who is an ex addict to meth and weed. My parents spent close to a million on therapy, plane tickets, holidays, and even unknowingly supplying it, all this over the course of 14 years. 

My mum has had a chat with me after she caught me talking about weed with 2 of my friends. She talked about how she herself use to smoke weed, and she’s against it because her ex-husband got schizophrenia and psychosis from it and eventually committed suicide. She doesn’t mind if I drink alchohol or smoke weed, but she said she wants me to wait later. In this conversation she also talked about if I ever did do anything she’d like me to tell her about it, and she promised she won’t get mad. But I’m scared of telling her I take study drugs as they’re closely related to methamphetamine.

I kinda switched up the mood halfway through this post, I need drugs to help me function, but I don’t want to get addicted or fucking die.

Me and some buddies used to get high on heroin and play this ""game"" where two people put their forearms together and drop a lit cigarette in the middle. The first person to pull their arm away was the loser. Of course, being on heroin and feeling no pain, we would just laugh as you start to smell the odor of burning flesh and hair. Eventually we realized how dumb this was and stopped. I still have a dozen burn scars all over my arms from this that will stay with me for life.  


Blacking out on 10mg of xanax and a dozen beers, breaking into my neighbors house in broad daylight with people watching me the whole time. I stole a bottle of wine and $2 in change and casually walked back home. I was arrested for burglary a few minutes later.  


Deciding to take 5 hits of acid before getting on a plane flight (with weed in my pocket) to visit a friend. Got on the plane fine, but ended up losing my phone, forgetting how baggage claim worked and losing my bag. I walked around dazed and confused in the airport for 3 hours before my buddy (who was picking me up) somehow tracked me down. Afterwards the airport mailed me the wrong bag and never recovered my stuff. I lost $1500+ worth of shit that day...  


I went to a music festival in Amsterdam (Jam in the Dam). I took 10g of shrooms and got to the festival. After a few songs and the crazy light show I completely blacked out (I think I had a seizure). I fell backwards onto this poor couple behind me. When I came to on the floor there was a group of people just staring at me like I had fucking died. I completely freaked out, got up and just started running. I tried to get back to the hotel, but I don't speak Dutch and all the street signs were in an alien language. I just wandered around completely lost for several hours until eventually I remembered most people there also speak English. This nice dude eventually showed me how to get back to my hotel.  


Getting completely hammered and doing coke all night at a party, when my buddy suggested we take his new sports car out for a drive with these 2 girls. Going 100mph in a 35mph lane he flipped the car. Luckily nobody was seriously injured, but cops came and he got some serious jail time.  


I have so many other dumb stories, some of which are too embarrassing to admit.

There seems to be a lot of confusion on the topic and I thought I could try do my part to investigate further. Many people may need to take antidepressant meds and there's nothing wrong with that. At the same time, people that may need to be on them for an extended period of time may want to enjoy the psychedelic experience just like everybody else. Psychedelics are a gift and we deserve to enjoy them too and reap their benefits

I am doing some research on the effects of taking psychedelics with antidepressant medications and would like to know what your experience has been?

If you are willing to share I would really appreciate your input. Please tell me the: 

 • medication

 • medication dose

 • did you avoid taking your medication for a period of time? 

 • lsd dose

 • what was your trip experience was like?

I will be making a post at some point on my results and discussion.

We waited for a while and suddenly this really dodgy bloke started walking really quickly toward me, my dealer and my friend. He said “Which one wants it” and I raised my hand. He then said “£20” i nervously passed him the note completely expecting him to just take it and tell me to fuck off. Luckily he actually gave me a full box of diazepam 10mg there was 28 pills in total. Me and my friend left and went home i took one and took another and for some reason it had this effect on me where id just keep eating them accidentally without noticing. I got suuuuper fucked and thought i lost them (they were in my sleeve) i was going to brush my teeth before sleeping and i cant remember anything after that but my family told me that I walked into the door twice and the box of diazepam fell out of my sleeve and they tried to make me throw up (which I couldn’t) so they took me to the hospital and i don’t remember anything like there was just a gap in my life i lost all memory. My parents told said that when the doctors asked me where i got it from I started going on about the deepweb and bitcoins and more random bs. I woke up and went to my psychiatrist and that all I remember. Oh and also when i got back home i was looking forward to eating my ferrero roches from Christmas but they were gone....

I'm thinking on buying some salvia, and i'm doing my usual drugs research before anything, but i have questions.

Dosage:  
I find a lot of conflicting info about dosage, and extracts. What is the correct dosage for a medium to hard trip on 5x?  
I've read dosages that go from 30 mg to half a gram. Sincerly, half a gram seems overkill, and not plesant at all, while 30 mg seems like a really soft dose.  
100 mg seem like a usual dose.

And the dose of pure dry leaves? I've found numbers from 250 mg to 1 gr.

Buying:  
I'm from Mexico, and i would be able to buy or 1gr of 5x pottency or 50g of just dry leaves for the same price and same vendor.

If i where to do an extraction of the 60g of dry leaves would make me like 10 gr of 5x potency, right?

What would you rather buy 1 gr of 5x or 50g of dry leaves.

Is one gr of pure leaves too hard to smoke as fast as its supposed? Is it doable?

I'm not really interested to do and extract, but if i have to, i would try.

Thanks! And, safe trips.

The high isnt anything like what you get from weed, everyone with me today agreed

But also i dont think its spice? (Unless it is, i dont actually know) Whatever it is makes you REALLY aware of things like you should not be that aware 

We are living in ignorance for a reason. This liquid gives you an extra sense or something, my friend said it felt like a bad acid trip

Its just not thc, first of all it doesnt even look like actual thc oil like its not thick at all and its coloured BLUE

I just kept buying it bc its an easy high

The high lasts for about 30 minutes and you can feel it hit within about 10 seconds of vaping it

Today was just extra weird and made me realise i shouldnt use it anymore. It seriously freaked us all out today bc i was in a group of about 5 people and they each had the oil in their vape (we were outside)

Its been like 10 hours now since i last had it and i still feel a bit freaked out

I dont like being that aware. Humans should not be that aware. Nothing is real and we arent supposed to know that

Also it made my legs feel SO hard to move, felt like my legs were huge weights

If you are struggling with addiction get professional help. I am going to go a CBT psychologist who specialises on addiction. Please don't think you can beat it yourself. And don't beat yourself up if you relapse. But if you have the money, seek help. This is the strong thing to do.

I've taken MDMA 3 times by itself; ~115mg is good for me and I don't redose. At around T+2:45 I start feeling like I'll be coming down for the next hour or so (personally though, I don't get much negative feelings on the comedown).

I've taken 2C-B only once, and it was supposedly ~35mg orally. I found the body load uncomfortable at that dose, with jaw clenching and a racing heart, but the visuals I had were getting 3-dimensional, which was interesting.

i overdosed on amphetamine sulfate earlier today (messed up in volumetric dosing, took around 750mg-1g) and am still dealing with the symptoms. right now i think i have extremely elevated levels of noroepherine causing hypertension (i think) and my heart rate is at 55-60bpm (my resting heart rate). which doesnt make much sense cos i expect the heart rate to be very fast. i keep switching strategies. should i just focus on relaxing and breath deeply? should i take a hot or cold shower (ive already taken a few). should i do some light exercise? should i get hot or cold? temperature is currently a bit warm from stress but not higher than normal. havent eaten much today also (at all) and cant stomach anything. ive been well hydrated (i think)

other symptoms are tingly face and hands due to vasoconstriction and anxiety (and NE)

i have some cialis, which can lower bp (if hypertension is even the issue, cant be 100% sure, but my norephrine levels are very elevated and im in constant fight or flight. should i take some? i feel okay apart from that stuff, but the stress is driving me crazy",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,682676,public,confidence,self,"amphetamine overdose, advice plz",0,[],0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gvgrzn/amphetamine_overdose_advice_plz/,no_ads,0.0,1591163664.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So school ends and we go to chill at his place, his mom aint home so we go to his outside sitting area to smoke. As were smoking he tells me that he's tryin to pick up a shit ton of oil to make edibles to sell. Some time passes and he gets a message, I know what's up so I get my keys. 

He tells me to go this Motel 6 on a highway, we pull in and as soon as you got to the steps at this place you could smell the gas. He's on the third floor and when the door opens we get blasted w smoke. There's 4 heads all with their own shit goin so the small ass room is basically hotboxed. My plug starts talking w his guy and i start toking on a blunt. They finish up and he shows me the shit and its obviously the most oil i had ever seen at once. 

We hop back in the car and he throws his shit in his bag, once were on the road we hit up people to chill w. This kid who I'll call D says he's at work rn but he's getting off soon so we could come through and smoke. So after we go shopping for the stuff to make the edibles we head into town goin to D's house but he's still at work so I pull into this small parking lot by this beach on a small lake.

 We both have pens so we start hittin them like crazy and then like 10 minutes later boom we see a cop rolling by. We stuff the pens in our pants and start talking, he just straight up says, ""Yo I can't talk to this cop I cant feel my legs"" , so I go into damage control mode and sober myself up as much as I can. The cop walks up to the window w his flashlight and says, ""So what're you guys doing here"", I explain we're just waiting for our friend to get home and its close to here so we just decided to park here. He says alright and asks for my license, its at this point that I remember that all my plug's shit is right in his bag, as the cop walks away w my license I look over and see that he had stuffed the bag under the seat but being honest it was not fully hidden. 

A couple minutes go by and another cop pulls up, they talk and then the other cop walks up to my car and starts looking through all the windows, I'm sweatin bullets wondering how he isn't seeing the bag that my plug is obviously trying to hide. He finishes and walks back to his car talks w the first cop and then drives off. Couple minutes later the fucking sheriff comes through and talks w the cop. I turn to my boy and say, ""Yo were fucked bro"". The two talk for like 5 minutes and then the sheriff fucks off, finally a couple minutes later the cop comes back and hands me my license and says, ""Ok so you just got to know its suspicious to be parked here without your lights on and that's why I'm talking with you. So if your friend isn't home yet please just go back to wherever you were"", I say ok officer and as he walks away I put my face in my hands and say thank fuck. My plug goes, ""Yo we woulda got a felony I got all that oil, a scale, and like a thousand bucks."" Now I sit there expecting the cop to leave and then figure out where to go but mans just sits there w his lights on, so I go before my ass gets us caught.

&amp;#x200B;

Not too long ago, I was bored.  Like seriously bored.  It got extremely boring sitting in my small little house with a boring job.  Around 3 weeks ago, I went downtown and came to the guys who sold drugs at night.  I asked them if there was anything I could do to feel better because at that time, I felt like wanting to kill myself if my boredom lasted any longer.  The guys were just about to wrap up for the night before offering me their one item that they had.  It was some weird psychedelic pills that was strange in color and shape.  It came in a small packaged bad and the pills resembled a very odd shape and was the color of some disgusting light blue color.  To cope with my boredom, I walked back to my home's parking lot, and I swallowed a single pill.  

After swallowing the pills, everything was fine.  up until I started having extreme headaches, stomach aches, and muscle aches.  I believe I passed out on the spot and no one helped me.  When I supposedly woke up, everything around me was red.  The buildings were unclear blobs of a non conformed shape, and all these voices started rambling in my head.  It was ear piercingly loud while I threw up in the red landscape with funny buildings.  I remember I also felt like I flashing shadowy figures that disappeared and reappeared.  As I thought this would just go away, I continued to walk and found a place to sat down.  I was sweating like hell and it felt as if I was in the middle of hell- literally.  Then, a car drove by and it was so loud that my eardrums felt like it was tearing apart.  The loud thuds of the doors closing also pained me, but what scared me the most was what I saw next.  The people that came out weren't people.  Instead, they were humanoid lizards that spoke in a loud gibberish type of language.  I tried going back to my house on the first floor and everyone I saw was a grey reptile-like human with bright yellow eyes.  I tried to ignore them and rushed by to my room(I did not lock my door).

That evening, it was just terrible.  I rushed to bed without taking any of my clothe off, feeling like I was burning in hell, my stomach extremely upset, and me still hallucinating, and I just tried to sleep.  But I couldn't.  The interior was red, I was still feeling extremely sick, and the flashing shadowy figures still appeared.  I believe I also passed out as I fell asleep.  

The next couple of days were similar, however, one day was the worst.  I could literally see the reptile creatures in my house trying to pounce at me.  I had not gone back to work nor called answered my boss as I was fighting these fake creatures.  They seemed so real and I was scared out of my soul.  There were things like these black snake creatures who suddenly grew 10 pairs of arms and tried to reach out for me while others started scratching me.  Many of the other creatures I saw were extremely similar to this; I just don't want to talk about them since I would literally feel like I would have a heart attack. Yes, there were many things as worse as this that I just don't feel comfortable describing right now. 

I passed out for days in a row to get minimal sleep to wake up to better days.  I had finally realized how destroyed my house was and how many holes in the wall and broken furniture there were. The bathroom was leaking, faucets never turned off, mirrors destroyed, furniture battered, and so on.  Just imagine a broken down haunted house like in the movies. I had bruises, blood, abrasions, and overall I just felt weak.  I was finally able to read and go on the computer and see how many calls I had, I forgot the other ones but I had realized my boss had fired me and my water supply service messaging me if I had anything wrong.  Not only this, there were broken pipes, walls, and necessities in the house that must be repaired.  My car was fine, but I still don't feel safe driving.

So this is what leads me here today.  I don't think I can pay for my house, I lost my job, my computer barely works, my portable electronics destroyed, but the strange thing is, I still sometimes see the reptile-like creatures and the red landscape at random times. It's almost as if the whole experience is coming back.  Last Tuesday, I had a full day of the episode lasting the entire 24 hours or more.  I feel sane enough to communicate and understand english now.

1. Once I had like 2-3 glasses of wine and had 2 lines of coke, I felt extremely bad about 30 mins after that. Now, I am suffering from mild anemia and it does happen to me to collapse randomly because of a low blood pressure. However, it never happened to me to feel so bad after taking a line or two (not even when i was taking meth). I will describe how I felt: could not feel my arms nor legs, very difficult breathing, started sweating and being cold in the same time, could not feel my head (sounds weird but thats how it felt), extremely dizzy, nauseous and so i began to panic that i’m dying or something. I fell down the ground in my bathroom too.. Why does that happen? Could it be related to cocaine? (I mix it with alcohol almost every time, never had issues) Shortly after that I fell asleep. Also maybe its important to know that I was home alone. But I am normally okay doing that in my own environment. 



3. How could you overdose with cocaine? Is there a fixed amount that could kill you or it depends on the person’s tolerance?

I recently got into meth (I only did a single line). It's my first time doing meth. I don't want to mess with it, because I did have some anxiety issues when I did it before, and I'm very much a control freak. 

I had a few drinks last night (3-4 beers over the course of the night, and 1-2 beers before bed). The next day I woke up and felt fine, as I was not drinking that much. 

I'm really worried about this. I know I should not drink and do drugs at the same time, but I'm not sure what advice I should give.

I'm not sure if I just have some problems on my end, or if I have some kind of withdrawal symptom.

I'm wondering if this is just a temporary problem, or if it's a problem that will last forever, or if I should try to stop doing this.

I'm really worried about my health, and I'm considering giving up on it. I know that if I stopped, I would probably go blind.

I'm worried that if I do go through with it, I will go insane, and I will probably end up in a psychiatric hospital.

I know this for sure because I got a letter home telling me that a package containing narcotics under my name have been seized.

The customs told me that I should call or write to them asap (within a month) to inform them about the package and it’s contents; whether I know about it or not.

So here’s where I need your help. 

Firstly how do I go about solving this situation? I have max a month but want to contact them ASAP for it not to seem suspicious and it beeing an honest mistake. What do I say? That I don’t know about the package? (seems stupid) That I know about the package and that it’s legal? Can I claim that I was actually going to use it for research? If so how would I do that?

Secondly how do I check if 1cp-LSD is legal in my country? Since the site I ordered it off was repuable and said that it was legal where I live. 1cp-LSD is a new chemical so I just assumed that it would be legal. The only information the autorities provide are that the substance is dangerous.

Thirdly I know that it is such a small thing to be charged by but I bought it with the intention of not being charged. Now that I can be charged I’d rather not.

And lastly I don’t want anyone from my family or relatives to know anything about this. Since they aren’t contacting me directly and have asked me personally to contact them I see no reason to inform anyone else.

IMPORTANT: Shipped via untracked package. I can’t for the life of me find anywhere that it is illegal

ANY help would be greatly appreciated

I'm very curious about experimenting psychedelics. But since I have an anxiety disorder with panic attacks I want to learn more about them before making any kind of decision.

I've spoke about this desire of tripping for the first time with friends and they have recommanded me to try MDMA first cause they think psychedelics could be too strong for me. I ve got very small tolerances on anything. I'm litteraly drunk with a pinte and high with half a joint.

So I've try MDMA three month ago, and had a blast ( even thought the build up was pretty overwelming and therefore a bit scary ). When I was scared I just repeat to myself I was under substance and I should just ride the wave. And I did, and it was wonderful I ll write a report soon. 
I also had a week long afterglow and it was my first week anxiety free since a decade. It really open me.


I also tried coke in the last 6 months but won't do it again. The effects were soft and enjoyable but it made me anxious the following days. Stim are not for me.

I'm carefull about the set and setting and I m around dear friends who do know about my issues. I only do drugs when I'm at least a week without my kids and any form of responsability. And those time are rare but it's ok for me. 

I'm interested in having a psychedelic trip. My friends have very different point of view. Two of them told me I should stay away from LSD but should try shrooms. Two other thinks LSD would be better than shroom. Another one think DMT would be the best for me.

Maybe I should start with very small doses of the substance I'll choose.
I want to experience visuals ( I did had some with MDMA and it was very mind opening ), seeing and feeling the world from another angle. 
Is microdosing or very small dosing a way to experiement this without being overwelmed ? 
Under psychedelics such as shrooms and lsd, are you still aware you are under something. Can you shake off the fear if it is unpleasant ? Can you still say to yourself it's normal / part of a trip and you should ride the wave like I did with MDMA ? Or you are totally disconnected from reality ? 
Is there a way to enjoy visuals or synesthesia with a somewhat clear mind ?
Is there a dosage in LSD or shrooms that will garanty you sort of a control if the trip take a scary turn.
Or the mind opening part of tripping is only BECAUSE you have to let go of some control ?


I m still unsure if I will go on with this. I will keep on reading, gather knowledge and self confidance to optimise the chance of having a very good time if I choose to go on.

Basically I've tried a half a tab of acid in the summer and didn't notice it but I didn't think anything of it really. I then had a full tab of different acid and all my friends were tripping balls on the same amount but again  I didn't feel it. Then yesterday we tried shrooms, we all had 2.5g and after an hour everyone was again, tripping balls, except me so I had 1g more, but hardly felt anything again. and then last night me and one other had a 2cb which I didn't notice but my girlfriend again was tripping pretty hard.

Obvisoulsy, i wanna trip but at the same time, I don't want to risk taking more and overdoing.

The week starts and instead of drinking some wine at night i change to cigarettes that get my occasional stress away, since i do not smoke them regularly i get also a fun buzz.

So I’ve been taking 12,5mg of seroquel at night to stop my nightmares. And my psychiatrist had hoped it would help with my ocd, general anxiety/intrusive thoughts (and depressive moods as a result of that) during the day as well. She hoped a good sleeping schedule would do wonders but unfortunately it hasn’t. 

I don’t want anti-depressants because I’m scared of them (heard negative experiences from others). So we’ve agreed that instead of that, I can take 6,5mg extra during the day whenever my ocd/anxiety takes a toll. She told me anti-psychotics work well for “turning off your thoughts” so it seemed like a good idea.

However.. I read some posts on here about usage of this drug and some people say it’s absolutely NOT supposed to be used to treat anxiety. 
Please share your thoughts with me on this. Had anyone with anxiety have experience with seroquel? (Negative and positive)

So far I’ve been really satisfied with the effect taking seroquel at night has on me. But now I’m kind of scared...

I was pretty much a loser my whole life and I got addicted to the popularity it brought me. I would sell to friends and actually started making money. Everyone thought I was the shit. Girls started grouping around me and I thought I was some big play boy when really I was just being used for drugs. 

I got sober. Got a good job. Got in a serious relationship. Then boom the relapse started when I thought it would be fun to do coke with my fiancé. The sex was better and it was just something fun to do. Then after awhile she changed and it was my fault. Her personality got really dark and “weird.” On top of that she told literally every one of her friends we do coke and even told her siblings who in turn told her parents. Then suddenly I’m a grown ass adult with people blaming me for getting another adult hooked on drugs just because she thought it was cool to be known as a druggie. 

As fucked up as it sounds I faked getting clean just to get her clean. Now I find myself tucking cocaine in my socks. Hiding straws and razors in my hotspots. Lying about where I’m going if I’m buying drugs. Lying about  medical problems to excuse my frequent bathroom trips. It’s just a mess and I’ve turned into the biggest asshole ever by lying to her about it. I don’t want to dissolve my relationship over a drug but I don’t know how to let go of said drug.

Someone on r/shrooms told me that there\'s no way it could\'ve been that strain, but I guess that doesn\'t really matter now that the trip is over. They looked like tiny light airy mushrooms, so I just downed the whole bag. It didn\'t taste bad, just bit of an earthy taste.\n\nHere\'s where the fuckups start.

I was getting anxious. Colors looked bright and vibrant, kind of like how when you just increase saturation. Something was definitely wrong, I didn\'t expect it to kick in this fast.

If I closed my eyes again I saw colorful creatures with sharp teeth. I did not want to be near them. I knew it was not real.\n\nWhat was worse was the realization that I still had to turn in my homework before midnight! I dosed at 7pm. I tried calling my class partner to turn it in for me. He was a close friend of mine and realized what was going on. I couldn’t even articulate what I wanted and the thought of me not turning in the assignment grew into a state of absolute terror. Holy shit I cannot describe the feeling. I heard sounds of children playing and people laughing. It was loud. I just wanted the auditory hallucinations to stop. I decided to forget about the damn assignment and go back to bed.\n\nOne significant moment I remember very clearly was that when I lied down, it felt like someone had grabbed my head and started pulling my neck back. I could not move my head. My jaw opened and it felt like I was leaving my body or something. Around this time I also remember a very loud and clear ringing in my ear.  I\'m curious if anyone had a similar experience.\n\nIt was like anything in my mind was amplified to the point that I could hear it in real life. I heard 2 chants in my head which went something like this: ""Follow the system, follow the code"" and ""Is anyone real, is anything real, does anyone know?!"". I think this had something to do with me not finishing my homework.\n\nI tried to relax, but I soon realized that I had to go the bathroom. I tried going there, and at this point I had nearly or did peak. And I was in a dorm with public bathrooms. Great combination. I went outside my room and tried walking to the bathroom. Someone came out of their room and I swear to god I saw that happen twice. At this point I was literally seeing things that were not there. I tried taking a piss and washing my hands but it was difficult considering that my entire field of view was covered in patterns and faces watching me.\n\n**I don\'t remember exactly when, but I honestly felt like I had died.** I figured at some point in my trip that I was stuck in some weird hell/purgatory (I\'m an atheist, and still am) and the only way to escape was if I jumped out of my window. Something held me back though. I can\'t describe what it was, but a large part of me just told me to stay the fuck in my bed. That\'s honestly one of the scariest parts of the trip in hindsight. I also went through my phone and my entire life was like some vague collection of memories. I had led myself to believe that me going to dinner was just a hallucination and **I honestly could not differentiate what part of my life memories were real or if they were all hallucinations.** After that, it\'s all sort of vague.\n\nBut one very significant moment was when I was coming down. Or maybe I had peaked then. I don\'t know, but I don\'t remember any visuals during this time. But I forgot who I was. It was such a bizarre feeling. I could not remember a single thing that happened in my life. I grew scared. What was I doing here? Who am I? The thought of an exam and homework was in my head but I couldn’t even pinpoint what those were. I can move around and walk but couldn’t remember a single thing. I kept pacing back and forth throughout the room, trying to make sense of my surroundings. I couldn\'t. It was a weird trance like state of confusion but I guess a part of me sorta also knew everything. But it\'s like I couldn\'t ""connect"" to that part of myself. I got worried that it may have been days or years and I was in some mental hospital.\n\nNext thing I remember I’m in a shower, and that’s when things start coming back. I don’t remember how I got there, but I’m there. I don’t know what date it is. I don’t know who I am. I go back to my room and my roommate enters. I’m just going through the motions and try to say what’s normal, it comes out. But I don’t know why I said those things. My roommate tells me that its been hours and I need to put my clothes on. **I felt the largest sigh of relief. It hadn\'t had been years. I didn\'t miss my entire first year of college. It been exactly 8 hours.** It takes a solid 30 min before things start coming back to me.\n\nWell, that\'s my story. The takeaways are pretty obvious, and I hope my experience allows new timers to make more informed decisions about their environment, always to have a trip sitter, and please don\'t treat this like some fucking joke. I learned it the hard way that it\'s not. This whole experience has soured my taste towards psychedelics and I don\'t plan on doing this again. I\'m glad I got it over with though. I still feel kind of uncomfortable how I was so susceptible into believing shit like I had died or forgot who I was.\n\n**It\'s like my entire identity was gone and I let go of all my life experiences, even that\'s all we really have to claim as our own.** I guess I\'m not as rational as I thought and my views about the world aren\'t as concrete as I was led to believe. And that\'s honestly the most unsettling aspect about this experience, even as I type this out. But no matter how much psychedelics fucks you up, I guess I can still say that it\'s not going to change me fundamentally as a person. Even through that horror shitshow, I still am who I am.

I had one real psychedelic experience with acid before, and basically led myself to believe that I was invincible and no amount of mind altering drugs could affect me and how I truly perceive reality. I spent years researching into acid just to try 1 tab, and when I did shrooms, I broke all the rules and just went for it. For context, I was told that it was 3.5 g of Psilocybe Azurescens, and it was a pretty sweet deal since I was low on cash but my dealer said I can have the extra anyways. Someone on &lt;a href=""/r/shrooms""&gt;r/shrooms&lt;/a&gt; told me that there&amp;#39;s no way it could&amp;#39;ve been that strain, but I guess that doesn&amp;#39;t really matter now that the trip is over.

First off I’m sorry if my previous post was misleading because I was led to believe he was always under the influence of meth psychosis because people only see him when he is very high/unstable due to that being the only time he wants to go out as other times he’s too depressed to want to do anything. So I actually believed the situation was worse than it is as I thought he had completely lost his mind (although the situations still not good)

 Many people advised to give him psychedelics when he’s sober but despite having access to LSD, DMT and HOT-17 (I couldn’t find shrooms) he disregards psychedelics and “does not want to fuck up his mind”. Obviously we all see the irony of that but he genuinely believes psychedelics are some of the hardest drugs.

Also in regards to him losing his apartment ( or should I say flat because apparently being from the UK and calling it an apartment is suspect) he has found temporary housing at a close friends but even they are fed up with his erratic behaviour and will most likely be kicked out soon. His biggest delusion/paranoia is the police he believes they are always waiting to raid the house, seize his money, etc. This always puts him on edge and results in him trashing places looking for listening devices and confronting people he believes to be an informant. I know it’s insane but he can’t be talked down. I assume that’s why he trashed his old place, looking for a listening device. 

Finally are friend group is split on calling an ambulance/medical intervention, as they claim he’s getting better and don’t want to over complicate stuff for him. I think this is ridiculous because when they say he’s getting better he nearly killed himself trying the “shake an bake method”, disappeared for two days and broke into a car all in one week. But I have spoken to him sober now as he is using social media again and do see a bit of sanity left in him.

It helps with my fibromyalgia, it helps me do exactly what i need to do at any given moment, idk....

Anyway, since I started taking it, the effects of it seem to have entirely changed for me twice so far. The first instance was like, scattered and hypomanically productive. The second instance was like Everything felt clearer and it was like adderall without the bad. But, the most recent 'evolution' of its effects on my brain, is the literally **THE  most ridiculous shit I have ever experienced in my life**. I feel like i am seeing new colors, thinking on levels higher than I thought was even capable, I'm creating dank art, fuckin driving while sitting on my door while letting my car steer itself, just feeling amazing... my heart is burning... clenching. This is logically impossible but I feel like I am being posessed by an angel or something. I just feel better than I have ever felt in my entire life, and I contribute that entirely to ephenidine.

I have been in the emergency room three times in the past 4 days. The first two times, my heart went up to 180 for about 30 minutes, couldn't think straight, blood pressure was 157 over 117 at its highest, but it is 'normally' now at stage two hypertension, even though I take spironolactone. I was diagnosed with hypokalemia and sent home.
The second time was essentially the same I just needed to feel monitored as I was experiencing pure exctasy. It's like feeling rainbows connect with every thought.


The third time I had a blood clot in my leg. It's really yellow, but the doctor says it's okay. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't DVT.

I feel sooooo fucking good but I'm also kind of concerned for my life because I couldn't have imagined I could have ever felt this good in my life

Abused vyvanse during college to get the 4.0. I got the 4.0 + destroyed my brain, likely permanently. The day I found out that I was unintentionally abusing vyvanse happened to also be the day it stopped working, permanently. I became scared. Dosed 2-3x my prescription amount in order to feel the high again; my personal reassurance everything would be okay. The only sympathetic effects I noticed were elevated heart rate, dry mouth, and instead of the usual mental/body rush, I felt extremely fatigued. Has anyone ever heard of or witnessed this? (Please comment, I’m looking for someone who I can talk to about this) One day it works. The next it doesn’t.

Suffered many symptoms. Constant fatigue. Inability to concentrate. Couldn’t get up in the morning. Caffeine literally gave me the worst fucking migraines in my life, for the first time ever. I was late to class. I couldn’t prioritize. I could not multi-task for the life of me. My memory was impaired. I couldn’t carry a conversation without stuttering. The list goes on. Life was terrible. 

Edit: At this point, I tried Caffeine-NALT mixture &amp;amp; also dexedrine, both caused severe severe headaches. Extremely irritable.

Fast forward a few months, I take a genetic test from a psychiatrist. Sampled by saliva. Turns out I somehow became a poor metabolizer due to lack of CYP2D6 (and a few others) (this specific enzyme happens to be concentrated in the substantial nigra which is where stimulants primarily do their job, so it makes sense), which is responsible for metabolizing most drugs, including stimulants. I was started on bupropion (an atypical anti-depressant) and it worked. It gave me energy (at least at first) and concentration, but very mildly impaired my working memory.

Fast forward a year, I attempt to try vyvanse again, after so long, because maybe my brain magically healed. It had a delayed-onset with half the rush it used to provide for me. After 2 days (once / day), I was in the same exact position I was in before. Literally zero.

Fast forward a few months, I learn I’m severely Vitamin D deficient (&amp;amp;lt;12ng/ug) and have anemia. I get a prescription for 50K D3 IU per week, and my god. The burst of ENERGY I received on my first dose did everything for me. Extreme levels of ENERGY, cognition, verbal fluidity. I no longer had trouble waking up in the morning the next day. My acne cleared. It seemed like a cure to all my ailments. Tolerance developed after 3 weeks. And by the 4th week, it did exactly zero for me. Baseline again, all my symptoms returned. I stopped taking it for a few weeks, then tried again, it worked but it wasn’t the same as the first time. Tolerance had reset and i understood that I had to maintain a level of tolerance to the D3 in order for it to work (including sunlight, i can’t receive sunlight everyday, otherwise I’ll grow tolerant; after a few days of constant sunlight, I could sit for hours and I’ll still feel fatigued). Note: based on reading/studying everywhere, I am confident this is an atypical reaction from D3, even for someone who is deficient)

Fast forward a year, I get an infection &amp;amp;amp; was temporarily prescribed glucocorticoids, specifically prednisone. Guess what? ENERGY. Explosive energy. At HALF THE DOSE. Verbal fluidity. Cognition. Working memory. My mouth became dry, and my “restless leg syndrome” returned from out of the blue. I was firing on all cylinders. It felt like vyvanse, I swear to God. It was more powerful than the first dose of Vitamin D3. Again, atypical response to prednisone.

Can you guess what’s in common between Vitamin D &amp; Prednisone?

Fast forward one more year, 2 days ago. I tried armodafinil 30mg (split a 250mg tab into 8 pieces), and it worked like a charm. The energy came back. The focus. The concentration. A feeling which I hadn’t felt in a long time, &amp;amp;amp; I missed it so much. I took it again today, and the effect seemed significantly less. It’s very likely that if I take it again tomorrow, the effect will be even more diminished.

I’m actually sad. On the verge of crying. I want this to work. My potential is hindered by not using these substances. (Sorry, venting)

After some surface level research, it seems as though the CYP450 enzyme system is partially responsible for modulating Vitamin D levels. Also, this enzymatic system (specifically CYP3A4, others as well) is induced by glucocorticoids. In addition, Vitamin D and prednisone both act as hormones, influencing gene transcription inside the nuclei of our cells. (Bupropion also does this, maybe that’s why it worked for me?)

I want to fix my chronic fatigue/lack of concentration. I want to be able to live with stable energy levels, and be able to get up out of my bed every morning, and be a productive member of society.

I got the 4.0 + destroyed my brain, likely permanently. The day I found out that I was unintentionally abusing vyvanse happened to also be the day it stopped working, permanently. I became scared. Dosed 2-3x my prescription amount in order to feel the high again; my personal reassurance everything would be okay. The only sympathetic effects I noticed were elevated heart rate, dry mouth, and instead of the usual mental/body rush, I felt extremely fatigued. Has anyone ever heard of or witnessed this? (Please comment, I’m looking for someone who I can talk to about this) One day it works. The next it doesn’t.

Suffered many symptoms. Constant fatigue. Inability to concentrate. Couldn’t get up in the morning. Caffeine literally gave me the worst fucking migraines in my life, for the first time ever. I was late to class. I couldn’t prioritize. I could not multi-task for the life of me. My memory was impaired. I couldn’t carry a conversation with stuttering. The list goes on. Life was terrible.

Fast forward a few months, I take a genetic test from a psychiatrist. Sampled by saliva. Turns out I somehow became a poor metabolizer due to lack of CYP2D6 (and a few others) (this specific enzyme happens to be concentrated in the substantial nigra which is where stimulants primarily do their job, so it makes sense), which is responsible for metabolizing most drugs, including stimulants. I was started on bupropion (an atypical anti-depressant) &amp; it worked. It gave me energy (at least at first) &amp; concentration, but very mildly impaired my working memory.

Fast forward a year, I attempt to try vyvanse again, after so long, because maybe my brain magically healed. It had a delayed-onset with half the rush it used to provide for me. After 2 days (once / day), I was in the same exact position I was in before. Literally zero.

Fast forward a few months, I learn I’m severely Vitamin D deficient (&lt;12ng/ug) and have anemia. I get a prescription for 50K D3 IU per week, and my god. The burst of ENERGY I received on my first dose did everything for me. Extreme levels of ENERGY, cognition, verbal fluidity. I no longer had trouble waking up in the morning the next day. My acne cleared. It seemed like a cure to all my ailments. Tolerance developed after 3 weeks. And by the 4th week, it did exactly zero for me. Baseline again, all my symptoms returned. I stopped taking it for a few weeks, then tried again, it worked but it wasn’t the same as the first time. Tolerance had reset &amp; i understood that I had to maintain a level of tolerance to the D3 in order for it to work (including sunlight, i can’t receive sunlight everyday, otherwise I’ll grow tolerant; after a few days of constant sunlight, I could sit for hours and I’ll still feel fatigued). Note: based on reading/studying everywhere, I am confident this is an atypical reaction from D3, even for someone who is deficient)

Fast forward a year, I get an infection &amp; was temporarily prescribed glucocorticoids, specifically prednisone. Guess what? ENERGY. Explosive energy. At HALF THE DOSE. Verbal fluidity. Cognition. Working memory. My mouth became dry, &amp; my “restless leg syndrome” returned from out of the blue. I was firing on all cylinders. It felt like vyvanse, I swear to God. It was more powerful than the first dose of Vitamin D3. Again, atypical response to prednisone.

Can you guess what’s in common between Vitamin D &amp; Prednisone?

Fast forward one more year, 2 days ago. I tried armodafinil 30mg (split a 250mg tab into 8 pieces), and it worked like a charm. The energy came back. The focus. The concentration. A feeling which I hadn’t felt in a long time, &amp; I missed it so much. I took it again today, &amp; the effect seemed significantly less. It’s very likely that if I take it again tomorrow, the effect will be even more diminished.

I’m actually sad. On the verge of crying. I want this to work. My potential is hindered by not using these substances. (Sorry, venting)

After some surface level research, it seems as though the CYP450 enzyme system is partially responsible for modulating Vitamin D levels. Also, this enzymatic system (specifically CYP3A4, likely others as well) is induced by glucocorticoids. In addition, Vitamin D &amp; prednisone both act as hormones, influencing gene transcription inside the nuclei of our cells. (Bupropion also does this, maybe that’s why it worked for me?)

I want to fix my chronic fatigue/lack of concentration. I want to be able to live with stable energy levels, and be able to get up out of my bed every morning, and be a productive member of society.

The day started with me smoking some weed, and meeting up with the plug to buy some speed. I just got out of jail and I told myself that I would do my best to stray away from harder narcotics. But for some reason I gave in. Call it weak I suppose. I feel some relief just venting this through text.

Well after twisting 0.3 of ice through a glass nail, the dude decided to front me a gram of molly to sell/use.

I had planned to use this high to join the riots going on in my local area, as I had been invited to partake. Welp, when I got there nobody wanted to buy any so I just split the gram between 2 friends. Fuck it, it's drugs. I don't mind running out. After taking some of my molly and their molly. Probably around 4-5 points, maybe 6. We took a drive to a nearby town and walked around like retards instead. It kinda fucking sucked. But I was too high to care and I was having fun. Kinda like a dog and a stick.

After we got back, it all started kicking in. Shit got absolutely ridiculous. I was slurring my speech. (Kinda like Jordan Belfort on Quaaludes in Wolf of Wallstreet) not only that, I was blowing constant smoke out my ass, trying to get in fights, straight up gassing everyone like a cunt. Being a now-it-all really. Not even a slick smart ass, just an actual ear-ache.

Everything I was talking about involved some sketchy concept or another, from murder to irrelevant personal thoughts about how much I despise my mothers lifestyle.

I would interrupt everybody, I am legit the worst guy at the party. My ego fucking explodes.

I brought some guitars over, and didn't even play much because I was too busy arguing about some logic based question about bananas. Oh, I also stripped down to my undershirt and underwear.

My thought and speech became extremely disorganized. I remember it in detail and it is haunting.

I firmly believe that this drug is a poison to me.

I make myself vulnerable to theft and assault while under the influence of it, and I regret my actions and behavior every time without fail.

I embarrassed myself again. I refuse to forgive myself.

Although it has been 3 or 4 months since I have done any sort of stimulant (meth, molly, or cathinones.) I believe it is safe to say that I have a toxic relationship with pretty much every drug except marijuana.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make this post as beneficial as possible for me so i'm going to ask some questions.

**Those of you that have successfully overcome impulsive drug use** when did you finally start to adjust and accept a normal lifestyle. *When did you begin to feel alive again?*

**Any of you struggling with some form of anxiety/insomnia** how did you start to get yourself out into the world without the fear of whatever your triggers are happening. *How did you slaughter that demon?*

&amp;#x200B;

Personally my drug use is getting out of control. Sometimes I manage to stop myself from doing a drug or stealing a beer because for some reason my conscious decides to exist. I think about my parents. It honestly makes me cry and deeply saddens me that is who I have become. I am watching myself shit on my own dreams.

I'm 18, unemployed, and extremely grateful to be housed and fed.

I wish I could better help myself. I will never stop trying. I don't want my parents to watch me make false promises and commitments only to crash burn and waste my life. 

In my mind, body, and soul I do not want to disappoint my family. I want proud parents, and I want redemption.

I want to feel more confident in my decision making and better about my overall self-esteem.

I want to feel worthy of caring for another person again, so maybe I can meet a new girl.

I also wanna fucking rock.

Ar first 4 key bumps and some beer later I was sitting in the dark and felt like my mind was dragged into it but without any the emotions were neutral - I felt neither scared or excited. When I really enjoyed ket though, is on the mdma come down. It was the smoothest come down I have ever experienced. There was this strange feeling like you’re stuck in the moment and make various associations about your life. After taking more I started feeling like my knees and ankles were reverse which is strange but kinda cool. 
Times Ive done dxm could be count on on two hands and maximum plat was 3rd. Upon taking it I always get the sensations Ive described (M combo). My last time on dxm I was pretty scared so I was taking multiple small doses and they were gel caps so I took like 600mg and it was a bliss. I was drunk walking but completely controlable and enjoyable unlike robo walking and had a constant smile and sounds felt blissful. Ive put on some porno and it was the single best wristing experience of my life. I was with my headphones and the voice of Lisa Ann felt like Im on a VR that feels like reality. I got goosebumps at times. 
So yeah, dex in probably my favorite drug. I find it hard to understand though why everybody hates it. One group of my friends tried it and they all hated it. I believe though the fact that they took mdma the night before influenced that because dex is serotoninergic as well. Another group of friends instantly shuts it off because taking cough medicine in large doses is non sense. But they do take other drugs that in reality were also medicine for certain illnesses but later became illegal due to their abuse potential. I believe that they would indeed take it if it was illegal. 
The ket and dex experience might have been off topic but I wanted to state the similarities between the two because ket is expensive and dex can be much more fun and they are both textbook dissos and while you combine ket and mdma you get an identical experience compared to dxm while the later is much more accessible and affordable.

And ya know, weeds much more enjoyable when you don’t have 100000 things to worry about. Me? I stopped cause I wanted to find my passion, sounds cheesy. So well, I got entered into Homecare courses. For private residences, rehabs, etc.
I learned to manage my anxiety, dropped cigs, alcohol, other shit- that would’ve prolly killed me. And look at me. I exercise, eat, right, I’m doing amazing in school. I’ve never been happier in my life.

I’ve realized taking what people say online seriously is pointless, as at the end of the day, none of you truly know me, or my circumstances.

Anyways, I got 2 Ksalols (aka 1mg Xanax pills) so I only got 2mg total, so I’m takin it with a bunch of rum to hopefully get fucked up.

Honestly I used to just look for stringent and stronger drugs, I wanted to do heroin atleast once, and all the others, but now I just want to do a shit load of psychedelics, self medicate and solve my brains issues, and that’s pretty much it.

The longer life goes on the more and more I dread my existence. All I want to do is help people in life, even though I’m also a massive, hateable dickwad to anyone I feel disrespects me, my core values, or anyone I care about.

I wanted to do this by becoming a rapper and eventually ODing, as I have never had any intention of living a full life, but not only is rap extremely hard for me, I’ve realized even if I make these songs that truly do help people who feel alone everyday of their life just like me, who would find it? Nowadays the rap genre is flooded by wannabes, clout chasers, fake pricks, and disgusting human beings.

I would really love some of you who have experience with Valium/diazepam to help me out here. I’ve done it before but so long ago I can’t remember how it affected my feelings. Tldr at bottom

Me and my ex boyfriend split up two years ago, mainly because we both had mental health issues and became very toxic for each other and it was a messy break up. I haven’t been with anyone since, every time I get close to a person I can only think of my ex. My ex has been in 3 relationships since but is currently single. A few months ago, I ran into him on a night out and we caught up, and he admitted to me that he missed me, and that he can’t seem to make any relationship work since me because no ones as good as me (his words not mine hahaha). I brushed this off. Over the next few months we talk online a few times, nothing flirty, although he messaged me just to tell me I was looking good last week.

Two nights ago he phoned me up, he’d taken some Valium and wanted to talk to me, said he didn’t know why but he guessed it was because I made him feel safe. He was very high but we had a good conversation. He kept apologising about how we ended, calling me beautiful, kind, that I was amazing and all this stuff. Said he misses me and really wants us to hang out again, wants me to come see him and maybe stay over, offered to teach me guitar (I’m not musical), and got excited because it would mean I would have to come over. At one point he said he wanted to get back together, I replied ‘what??’ And he didn’t repeat it, so I don’t know if I misheard, but there was also another point where he said he will always ‘feel the same way’ about me. I said you’re just saying all this because you’re high, and he said ‘no, I tried to tell you last time I saw you too, but I don’t know if you got it.’ (Referring back to when I ran into him as I wrote earlier)

Anyway his phone died and he fell asleep. He messaged the next day and said he’d love to meet up, and that he can’t really remember much from our conversation (idk if this is true) and then we spoke over messenger until like 3am, but nothing more than friendly.

Basically, my question is, would it be the Valium making him feel/say those things? All I’ve thought about is him since that conversation, it made me really happy and I would love to get back with him and give it another shot because I’m in a better headspace, it’s been two years and I still love him. But I don’t want to get my hopes up in case he really doesn’t remember anything, he might not feel that way at all and it was just the Valium making him lonely or desperate, I don’t know. 

I know this isn’t the relationship subreddit so don’t feel you have to delve into any of that, I was just trying to provide some context. So yeah. Any insights on how these drugs affect your romantic feelings would be great.

&amp;#x200B;

**The budtender then hands the stash to ME and says ""that's for you"".**

&amp;#x200B;

I look at this dude in the eye and asked wtf is going on. He says ""that's on me brotha enjoy it"" and I swear I was bouta cry in this bitch. I look inside the stash and there is 7 1-gram pre-rolls in the bag. I was like ""Bro I can't take this from you, that's your hard earned money"". And he was like ""Naw bruh just enjoy it, I do this all the time for people. And you look like a good person"". And so I thank this man, shake his hand and asked him for his name. His name is Charlie, a 6'2 African-American male in his early 30's. I offered him the $5 I had in my wallet, but he didn't want it. So I put it in the tip jar. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night taught me a couple life lessons. Never judge a book by it's cover. I also don't think I deserved his praise because I have done a lot of bad shit in my life, but I learned that I should stop living in the past. 

&amp;#x200B;

Charlie, my brotha, thank you for the free weed. And black lives matter. &lt;3",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,682537,public,confidence,self,"Thank you Charlie, the African-American man who gave me a free quarter of weed.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/gv10bh/thank_you_charlie_the_africanamerican_man_who/,no_ads,0.0,1591103306.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The longest I've been completely sober since 2013 was 9 days and I'm beyond tired of taking drugs - I have been for about 5 years now. I've been living with really bad brain fog and social anxiety since about 2014 but I've just never had the strength to stop for good until now. Sounds a bit ridiculous but I'm sure some folks can understand that. I think it's just a chemical imbalance and when I stop for a while I'll be able to function again.

Whenever I try to sleep at night without a joint my mind just starts racing and I'll be up for like 6 hours trying to sleep before I eventually give up and just stay up all day. So I've started taking pregabas (150mg capsules) to get a sleep at night. My plan is to take the lyrica until I'm in the clear and no longer going through the period of struggling to sleep.

I'm on my 5th night of no weed and I'm staying off it this time. I've been spending my days sober without even thinking about smoking and then I take the lyrica at about 1am as a sleep aid.

It's my 6th night of taking it, and I usually don't take more than 450mg a night. I'm planning on staying on the pregabas for another week or so - however long it takes until I can sleep without all the disruptions. I can handle the crazy vivid dreams as long as I can actually sleep.

If I'm taking 450mg of pregabalin for a couple weeks, or even a few weeks, will I likely be going through withdrawal when I stop? I'm a recovering opiate addict so I've been through withdrawal many a time and sometimes even after a couple weeks onit I'd be withdrawing, but I've seen myself taking lots of gabapentin for 3 months without a day off it, even drinking whisky on top of it daily for the last month of taking gabapentin, and I somehow walked away without any noticeable withdrawals except for the first day sober and even at that I was just a moody bastard. No physical withdrawal. It wouldn't surprise me if the pregabalin is different though .

Will I likely be withdrawing after 2 or 3 weeks on the lyrica? Will it probably not be so bad, or will I probably be in for a shit time coming off it?

Combine it with psychedelics and...I don't even want to go on about what it can lead to honestly.  Like, I don't really want to give people the bad idea and whatnot.  Hell, one can put two and two together.  But in the wrong hands, or perhaps the most choice considering the nature of this beast, it can lead to the destruction of communities.  It's not just the dope even.  This shit will bring down whole countries.  It will make cultures appear as what they are not.  You think krocodile is scary?  Scopolamine abuse will eat you inside out, starting with your soul, then through your mind and eventually the body will keep a score that no living being should have to try to sleep with even.  


Deceptive drug lord gangs have gotten a far bit more crafty with these combinations.  Like I said, it's not just the drug.  Sometimes psychedelics will teach us is that set and setting matter just as much as intention and the effects of the drug itself.  It's as simple as running over for a gram of blow.  You respect the dealer when they say ""hold tight, I gotta go in the back and use the scales...""  When you go to a bar and order a drink, does your bartender go in the back to mix it?  Hell no!  You watch them mix it right at the bar.  But this has gone much further than common tactics.  This has gone further than ""they just blow it in your face, maybe rape you, maybe rob your bank account via ATM while they are out with you...""  They will use it to cover up their own guilt and wrong doing even.  And in the midst of that adventure itself, greed shines through at the golden opportunity to take full control of anyone and anything they see fit.  This shit can be laid on paper money.  A sprinkle in the baggie before handing it off in a choice setting where manipulation and deception turn you into a slightly zombified fool.  Only to realize years down the road, once your consciousness clears a bit finally, that you remain guilty due to the actions resulting from manipulation/deception.  Or worse, you realize that for 25 years, you haven't really had much of a chance at a life and even once it's all over...you can't really form a life that comes anywhere near the potential of your dreams.  So much time has gone by, it's almost like, what's the point?  And that's just what they want you to feel like too.  That's why it does not matter if you do not follow through with what they desired of you right away.  Either it works a bit, opens up a gateway for them to feel out even more of the community to seek more power, or you mosey off until you can not take it anymore.  The most difficult part is realizing it has happened so that you can wake up from the trance, much less proving it in order to seek proper therapy and even notifying the right authorities.  And let's face it, in the world we live in today, where we kind of 'hate' authority... this is something they need to really open their eyes to.  This level of terrorism has grown well above that of what the gangs we formed on the US west coast to fend off these kinds of attacks can manage to contain.  The least I can do is speak some from my experiences within the drug community itself out of the hope of harm reduction.  I kid you not when I feel like I am sitting here with my family, watching how it has turned a majority of the world against itself.  Call me crazy (cuz, I done been through the nut house lol) but I'd say this could lead to the largest terrorism act the globe has seen in history.  And I do not care how many people say ""but...I buy transderm patches of this stuff off Amazon for motion sickness...""  Yea, and people die from passing out with a fent patch on too.  When we make it ridiculously easy to administer...ugh...it just gets worse.  


Drugs are good, and they are bad.  But I do not believe that they are always bad.  Some people get addicted to certain things, some do not.  The whole ""don't do drugs"" saying, is bullshit.  That does not mean one should go out and start railing angel dust of course.  But as we have discovered before, prohibition does not solve the issue.  Diving deep into the mystic is perhaps the only way to find the answers to questions that we have yet to ask ourselves.  Denial will almost always result in misinformation not to forget a lack of wisdom that must be captured within community for life to go on at times.  And remember kids, always send a small sample of your score off for proper GC/MS testing; especially with a new source.  The answers are always at our fingertips these days; and sometimes right under our noses!  Lastly, this is one plant drug I would be relieved to be rid of on this Earth; no good will come from this.  If I were a seasick sailor, I would considering a different medicine and completely avoid scopolamine.

I was put on mild pain killers, 30mg T3. I was offered stronger but turned it down for a reason. I don't have the same kind of reaction to opioids that normal people do. I've never felt any kind of euphoria from them, instead I get nausea, mild stomach pain and mild dizziness. The dizziness does go away after about a week adjustment but it does work to relieve the pain. Basically how I judged using them was if the stomach discomfort would be less than the shoulder pain, I would take them.   


I had a doctors note and was supposed to have a safe return to work plan with modified duties so I wouldn't stress it. Company basically threw it out the window and as a result, the whole arm now is having issues. Because I would adjust how I carried stuff, my forearms, biceps and wrist basically had to pick up the slack and now all of that is in pain on a daily basis. Even typing this is painful.   


While the shoulder injury has somewhat healed, and I am scheduled for physiotherapy for my arm now, the doctor won't prescribe any more pain relievers for my arm. I tried to adjust, but the pain is becoming increasingly intense at work to the point I can't hold anything over 5lbs on it without it spasming or stinging. My left arm is now feeling effects of it too, as I'm putting everything on it as well and while physio is coming up, due to the whole coronavirus thing it's literally over a month away and will likely take months more to repair.

For real tho I have been addicted to heroin and it's the harder shit to get off, you just get sick really bad and want to die. Once you get to the first days it starts to get better, but the cravings won't stop, like ever, for the rest of your life most likely. You'll never be the same, that's a fact.

Meth is the same as heroin in terms of how it fucks up everyone's lives but it has a few differences between, like a lot of brain and cognitive damage because of all the trashy chemicals that this drug has and the lack of sleep in years. Ain't have to say about the shit that it does to your face and teeth cuz everyone knows that, as well as the lose of weight. It turns you into a godamn zombie and after years of trying it you will never be the same even if you stop. It will drain you out from inside out, make you forget about your inner self and will turn you into a godamn zombie that doesn't give a damn fuck about anything besides having this drug with you everytime. 

Stay away from popping benzos too.
Unless it's used as prescribed, still many people don't care and buy them ilegally which is very easy to find a source, eventually get hooked and have to pop more and more to receive the same feeling as tolerance builds up, until it gets to a point where you need em to even be semi functional and be able to get through the day.

I woke up bright and early this morning to prepare myself for the DMT trip that my housemates and I had been planning ever since he was able to score enough of The Spirit Molecule for 5 breakthrough doses. I enjoyed a morning coffee, watched the Sun break through clouds to form a beautiful day, and lit an incense to fully immerse myself in the spiritual mindset.

Recently, my housemate and I have been engaging in deep, thoughtful conversations about pretty much everything relating to the essence of life such as spiritualism, consciousness, philosophical teachings, the roots of problems in our society (especially the neglect that led to current rioting), and the spread of love in all aspects of life instead of hate. His feelings toward these things were shown to him in his life-changing DMT experience years ago, and now it was my turn to transcend this path to enlightenment.

At 1:30pm, We drew the blinds and began the ceremony. Immediately after taking the hit, my entire body felt warm as if an angelic presence was coursing through my veins. I began seeing visuals similar to an acid trip and I was hearing one of my favorite songs in a brand new way as if it were speaking directly to me. But to my surprise, I stayed in the room the whole time because I didn't smoke enough to breakthrough. It was comparable a mild-medium acid trip but with good vibes and happy feelings. I was a little dissatisfied as I had been preparing to be thrown into a new reality, but this story isn't really about me...

My housemate's friend is the one who got the breakthrough dose (let's call him Peter).

Peter went out like a light before he could even pass the rig off. Head back, eyes closed. You know, the standard DMT position. He was out for around 5 minutes when he opened his eyes and hugged his friend with everything he had saying ""I love you so much"" through tears. It was a beautiful moment. But after that he suddenly stood up, asking us to go outside. They went out the front (which I thought was a bad idea because we live in a densely suburban area but whatever) and he roamed around the yard and got his fresh air. He kept asking us to turn the music off even though he just unplugged it before going outside.

Upon returning to the safety of indoors, Peter laid face-down on the floor for a minute or so. He then got back up, grabbed his backpack and phone and started walking out the door telling us that he needed to get back home to his girlfriend and daughter. I wanted to stop him to make sure that he was fully back with us before he left but I don't really know him too well so I didn't want to intercept him. His good friend (my housemate) didn't stop him either. We figured that he learned some great lessons during his trip and realized that he needed to enact immediate change in his life. He must have known what he was doing and where he was going.

He hopped in his truck and flew down the road, fast. We were worried but reassured ourselves that he wouldn't drive if he wasn't fully conscious yet (in our reality). So we hung out for a while in the living room, deliberating everything that had just happened. Maybe about 10 minutes later, Peter knocks on the door. I open it and he bursts inside, fully naked, not an ounce of clothing left on him. He came in saying he had no idea where any of his belongings were, including his truck. I yelled to my roommate to ""get some damn clothes on this guy"" and we were both at the very least relieved that Peter was okay.

As I was closing the door, I saw a cop car go flying down the road. That's when we panicked. 

We scrambled to hide all of the drugs and rigs scattered around the living room. Peter hopped in the shower. The other guy with us (pseudo-named Frank) and I were about to hop in his car to go find the truck because it couldn't have been too far away, right? That's when a policewoman approached me. She asked me if I just got back from PT training (the cops had found Peter's military ID in his belongings). I said no, so she asked me if I knew Peter and if he was inside. Crap. I tried my best to tell them what happened without telling them exactly what happened, but also without lying. I explained that we had been engaging in heavy spiritualism and meditation and that some people can't quite handle it with ease. I said that Peter had been expressing his love and gratitude to us, his life, and his family right before leaving to go see his family so he could make things right with them. She said that they had received ""27"" phone calls about our nude runner of a friend. They convinced me to bring Peter outside, which I did after telling them what I told the cops.

There was at least 6 police cruisers out there, 2 on either side of the road about 500 feet down, 1 blocking my driveway, and 1 parked in front. There were cops walking all around our house and talking to the neighbors. It was a bit intimidating at first, but some of these cops were truly great people. Also Frank used to be good friends with one of them so we were shooting the shit with him while the others dealt with Peter and my housemate. The cops reassured us that they weren't concerned about the cause of the mental breakdown, whether it be from drugs or alcohol, and that they just wanted to make sure he was okay. The policewoman who seemed to be in charge could have been a therapist. She was great, very polite and respectful. They talked on the stoop for about an hour and gave us plenty of resources for mental health therapy in our area. 

Frank, his cop buddy, and I went to go collect Peter's truck and his belongings. The truck was about 3 miles away, parked in the middle of a field with the door wide open and keys in the ignition. His clothes were scattered everywhere in the field, his wallet was disassembled because he must have been throwing all of his cards like they meant nothing. We couldn't find his phone though (went back 2 times then found it later).

When everything was settled and all the cops left, Peter told us briefly about what he experienced. After smoking the DMT, he was teleported to a new universe full of geometric patterns and shapes. He lived out 6 life-times in 5 minutes. He realized that he was wasting his time goofing off rather than being there for the ones that truly mattered in his life. He thought he had come back through so that's when he needed to leave to go home. Once he started driving, the DMT hit again and the road began disintegrating in front of him and he didn't know where he was. Fortunately he arrived at his destination (the middle of a field) safely. When he got there, he was disoriented and starting thinking that everything was fake and that there was no meaning to anything, hence the throwing of all his belongings. But he knew that he would be safe if he could find his way back to my house. He found a bike and rode halfway home completely naked. Then he trekked the rest of the way on foot. Tons of people must have saw him because it was mid day, but then again, things could have ended much worse. Peter was okay after all of this, and he was joking about deleting all social media and getting a haircut or a new hat.

All in all, our image is probably permanently tarnished in this community as the neighbors didn't seem to like us too much before this happened. But we all certainly had a memorable experience and learned a few lessons along the way. It actually turned out the be a pretty great day after all.

Biggest lesson: Don't let your friends leave the house if they smoked DMT 8 minutes prior. Give it at least 30 mins everytime. Be safe, healthy, and spread as much love as possible.

Yeah, off to a great start. Anyway, it was a Monday, and actually the first full week of school. Ok, for background, I had been drinking with a couple of friends for about a month at this point, just getting completely shitfaced pretty much every day. This particular day, I was only with one of them, and for this story his name is gonna be Austin. Anyway, me and Austin get out of school, and both go home. About 20 minutes later, he shows up at my house with half a bottle of whiskey and an almost completely full bottle of Black Cherry 99. So, this is some serious shit, being 40% and roughly 50% respectively. Now, I only had two shot glasses, and one of them was a double shot. Personally, I'm terrible at taking shots, so I gave the double shot glass to Austin, and he didnt care so we were all set. This is where it starts to get fuzzy, I think I downed 4 or 5 shots of whiskey. I started to feel a buzz, and we (for some reason) decide to walk to our school. Drunk. Literally like 40 minutes after it closed. Anyway, we get there and from what I remember walked down the little pathway to our school, cane across another student who I 1. Didnt like and 2. Had interacted with before when I was drunk so he probably knew what was up. Pretty much, we started arguing about some dumb shit, and it ended with me grabbing his binder and throwing it in our school's Ga-Ga Ball pit, yeah I know, dick move. Anyway, after that we left and headed back to my house. At this point I think I could tell I was drunk, but I wanted to get more drunk. My goal was basically to have a blackout night. So we get back to my house, grab the shot glasses and this is where it gets fuzzy. I know I took around 5 or 6 more shots (yeah, this story is nice and full of dumbass ideas) total, idk what was what but I remember the taste I had in my mouth after. After the shots, I had a glass of root beer to drink out of to get rid of the alcohol taste, but the taste of root beer, whiskey and Black Cherry 99 is not a good fucking combo. Ok, so after that I know I grabbed a capri sun out of the fridge cause i just wanted to throw up from the taste in my mouth at this point. The last thing I remember before the big blank space left by that night is walking down my street. Anyway, the rest of this story is gonna be mostly what other people told me, because I dont remember shit. Basically, after we did that last round of shots, we stashed it in my closet and left. Austin says that after we did that, we went to a friends house who lived up the street. Again, for the sake of the story I gotta give him a fake name, so let's go with Jacob. Ok, so we went to Jacob's house, and tried to get him to come outside, then he said no and we started to walk away and just fell down right in his yard. His mom threatened to call the cops, so we left. We ended up going back to the school, and it seems like that's when all the shit we drank took full effect. Austin says we walked around at the school, until I fell over in one of the doorways and couldn't get up. He said he kept trying to get me up, but I was slipping in and out of conciousness, and he started hearing the sirens. Needless to say, its not like we were getting away this wasted, and we were arrested. The only memory I have of this is sitting in the back of a cop car, brushing my hand against the window and saying ""can you let me out?"" Yeah...probably not too healthy to forget an entire night. I guess I also threw up in the cop car too, because I lost my favorite sweatshirt and a nice pair of jeans that night. After that, we were split up, and I woke up the next morning with three cotton balls taped to my arms (2 on the right, 1 on the left) and a hospital bracelet, so at this point I know I fucked up. Turns out, If the cops didnt get me when they did, and get an ambulance, I probably would have died. According to the police report, my alcohol blood level was 3.19. This little incident got me grounded for 2 months, and 175 bucks in the hole. All in all, I regret it. Good learning experience, at the rate I was going it probably would have happened at some point anyway, but I still regret it. Since then, I've only drank a handful of times (although I cant say im sober, as I do other drugs) and to anyone who is currently around that age, and drinking, just be careful. If you're taking shots, (depending on what it is, of course) only take a couple and then wait 30 minutes for more, as it usually takes 30-40 minutes to kick in. If I had thought about that at the time, it could have saved me from a lot of shit. Anyway, I hope you all enjoy this story, maybe I'll talk about some of my other drug stories if this gets a good response.

I struggle with benzo addiction and legitimately want to taper off. I talked to an office with some availability and told the receptionist I needed a refill on my klonopin. She checks my DEA database and sees I was never subscribed kpins but sees that I had a suboxone script. I freak out while she asks if I still take subs and I say yes and tell her to cancel the appointment. I don’t even take subs anymore. 

A month goes by and still no psych appointment. I’m getting deep into bars, taking 6-8 a day now. so I call back and the same lady picks up and she asks why I need to see a doctor and I tell her I need to taper off benzos. I don’t know why I was so honest but I guarantee she’s thinking “this kid is playing us.” Says they’ll follow up and never do. 

I got an appointment with a psych tomorrow, but he’s known my history with substance abuse since this is the guy I was reffered to through my extended care rehab program. I know he won’t  prescribe benzos even though I’m taking enough to seize out if I stop. Hell just tell me to go to detox. 

My dumbass calls back the other office today since this is still the only office where I live that quickly takes new patients. she sounds pissed that I even called and I’m just like I NEED MEDICATION MANAGEMENT. Asks me if I’m seeing any other psychs and I said I have an appointment but I want another doc for a second opinion.

I was still at the peak, and a very strong one because i smoked hash mins before it kicked in, but i guess that wasn't the problem because i did the same thing in my 1st time and it went really well. 

I don't know what the fuck happened, has this ever happened to anyone here? I kept going from my point of view to another person point of view, i can't really explain, basically i felt like i wasn't in control, it was pretty rough, later on i redosed smaller and smoked a few joints and had a manageable comedown.

Yogis, transcendental mediators and psychonauts corroborate Leary’s findings of cured life-long addiction and neurogenesis. All practices that Christ was rumored to have engaged in during his lost years wandering and holistically healing the people of India.

So I smoked for one month right now regularly (self rolled cigarettes). I used 3x30mg packs of tobacco in that time. I know there are people who smoke a lot more like a big pack of cigarettes a day. Some days it seemed for me like I lighted every 30 minutes a cigarette due to heavy study and learning sessions for my psychology degree at university.

Some days ago I started getting bad effects like complete loss of appetite, I didn't eat more than 1000 calories a day and didn't drink enough water as it just tasted bad and was really hard to swallow. Now I still have these issues, bad physical condition and endurance and some acid reflux in my neck, breast and stomach. I quit my last 30g pack and now I want to stop as I never liked smoking that much at all, it just was nice for making a break from studying and having some time free to think and be with myself on my balcony.

How much and often do you guys smoke? Anybody who smokes like every 30 minutes? A pack a day? Two packs? A 30g pack a day? I would be very interested in reading about your experiences. I also have the negative thoughts of fucking up my lung too hard and maybe developped cancer. I hope not and I know it's a lot psychological thoughts connected to the physiological side effects that occured and I still am effected from. What's your opinion?

The side effects were:

Acne occurring where it never had occurred before

Skin becoming more brittle and more easily damaged

Skin peeling and flaking off on the soles of the feet

I’ve had bad anxiety before but never anything so bad I can barely function. I usually get it most at school or in stores usually I can be strong and push through it but often times I’ll have to leave on the spot. More recently i been getting this anxiety at home with no initial cause and it’s painful to live through. I’ve developed breathing problems this last week where my anxiety will get so bad I can’t breathe this often happens when I have to focus on breathing or go to bed it also happens if I am around anyone or if there is random little stressors or things that overwhelm me . I also get what I think to be heart palpitations where I can feel something on the left side of my torso under my rib beat and can feel it through my skin , it beats sometimes really fast or slow I can visibly see my skin move . It always snowballs and gets worse too like if I can’t breathe because of anxiety that gives me more anxiety making it harder to breathe thus it infinitely gets worse and if anything little overwhelms me while I’m in this state it makes it so much worse . This sucks because I can’t even see my friends , I’m afraid too it’s so stressful and when I’m around others I can’t be around them for long . It’s inevitable to be alone , I have no idea what to do . I went to see a doctor and he couldnt figure out what was wrong with me .I believe it was anxiety because right when I was in his office and I had like that authority figure to know what’s wrong with me and help I just felt so much better and the anxiety went mostly away , however right after and right before it was really bad . I was also prescribed an inhaler just in case it was like an asthma related issue , however the inhaler barely helps so I believe it is an anxiety issue . I never have had a prescription before so it’s really weird to me and I don’t want to combat a drug related anxiety issue with more drugs if the doctor prescribed me anything . Especially since I have a history of drug use With a wide range of variety (thc, mdma, lsd, psilocybin, alprozolam ,nicotine, phenibut) obviously with marijuana being the most used and others used on rare occasions never consistently. I also had a problem with alprozolam a few months ago but beat it . Now I can’t even smoke which I used to do on the daily for years , I’ve been laying off everything this passed week including nicotine due to these anxiety attacks . I just want some feedback I apologize for this being so long it just makes me feel better and less anxious to get this all out. Edit: the main problem is having such bad anxiety I can’t breathe .
TLDR: dosed amphetamines for my first time resulting in having anxiety attacks nearly a week later. Need feedback on if this happens to anyone else and what should I do ?

I only want to use acid once, so how would that affect weed, if at all? Any other advice about it is welcome :)

My parents are old fashioned immigrants that don't understand neurological/mental health issues. Growing up I always expressed that I feel ""not right"" or that I can not function correctly compared to my peers. My parents have always shut this idea down and have just told me to stop. I've always been able to more than get by in school, which is probably based on intellect alone but I always felt I was struggling so bad. I'm not someone SUPER smart, but I have always been able to understand things easier than peers.  

I started using (*abusing technically,* since it's not my prescription) adderall around when I was 17 after I learned the chemical properties and how it affects the brain. After taking and monitoring a small dose, I realized my functioning improved so much. I felt like I was ""normal"" for once. After gaining enough confidence (around age 18 in college) and expressing to my parents that adderall helps, they were quick to shut it down again with ""You just want to do drugs"". 

I know if I go to a physician and say ""hey adderall helps me function, would you test me and prescribe me it"" they would easily just assume I want drugs. I am not a drug addict by any means, I barely even smoke weed. Yeah, I've ""experimented"" here and there, but I have no substance abuse disorder or whatever the DSM considers it. I.E. No dependency to anything, not even caffeine. 

But, that's how most doctors are now. I wish they could understand the knowledge I have of body chemistry and physiology and that for years I've been ""experimenting"" in a way, safely, with adderall and know it really does help me. This angers me deeply because I really just want to be able to function well. Just because I don't have a ""documented"" history of ADD or ADHD or whatever, doesn't mean I am not struggling. This could apply to any ailment. Some people don't have resources, or parents who will get them tested so later on they resort to ""illegal"", and usually dangerous methods. 

I'm currently studying biochemistry and ironically intend to go to medical school, when people say there needs to be a healthcare reform I believe they mean in this aspect as well. I wish doctors weren't so dismissive and pretentious.

I hadn't taken any for 2 weeks, but started taking it again on Wednesday, then Thursday, and Friday. 

I already hadn't slept since Tuesday night, because I've been working on a commission and it seemed like it'd be okay. So I just stayed up until I stopped taking the Adderall on Friday night. I already know that the sleep deprivation is a bad idea, I was just being stupid, though it's not the first time I've stayed up 3+ days. Thankfully, I did fall asleep Friday night and slept for more than 12 hours.

So then I took my Adderall (60m) on Saturday morning. But nothing happened. Absolutely nothing. The cognitive benefits, mental clarity, focus, motivation, etc. was all totally absent. It was such a surprise that I tried taking another 10mg (for some reason) but still nothing.

I've taken this 'script for more than a year. This is not the first time I've taken my meds 3 days in a row, and 60mg is not the highest dose I've ever taken on consecutive days -- still, this hasn't happened before.

 The only thing that seems different is the fact that I didn't sleep for those 3 days. Could that be contributing to this?

I'm gonna take several days off from the Adderall to see if this is some weird tolerance issue (even though it hasn't happened like this before) so hopefully it will start working again by then. But I'm just wondering why it might be doing this, when I've never had this problem before? Could it be related to the sleep deprivation? And I know I'm asking way too much of the universe right now, but -- is there any other way I could fix this?

The guy said they were 300ug (which i don’t believe) and I took a tab and a 3/4 and my friend only took half because she is experienced and didn’t want too much. I previously only took 1 tab about a month ago and nothing happened. When i took the 1 tab I did feel something but i didn’t really see anything and i also fell asleep 4 hours after taking it. So last night i took more hoping it would actually work. It infact did i’m pretty sure, I felt crazy and I saw some stuff. But then after about 5-6 hours it was over for me and i was ready for bed. But my friend was still going strong. We also smoked twice last night because at the beginning i was feeling anxious and then the weed calmed me down and then i was having fun! But then after only just 5-6 hours everything was over for me, the feeling was gone and no visuals. I don’t know why this happened to me when i took significantly more than her. I admit something was off and i did see a kaleidoscope type pattern but then it was over just like that after the few hours. I don’t take any medicine so i’m not sure why this would happen. My friend said this has never happened to anyone she knew so i thought i’d ask reddit what they think is wrong with me.

I don’t believe I need them anymore and I feel like my back is much better.

However, I’m now addicted to them. It’s not like I really even get that buzz or euphoria anymore. I don’t even know why I take them. When I wake up in the morning I feel somewhat sick and anxious since I usually take my last dose around 8PM. I feel like they just make me feel unhealthy now and I want to quit but I don’t have the willpower to taper down. I always have an excuse as to why I need the regular dose. What do I do?

About 3 years ago I tried amphetamine at an after-party and was told I should feel a rush and then just a feeling of well-being. I felt nothing. So I did maybe 6 or 7 lines in the span of around 4 hours and still felt nothing. I went home and fell asleep right away. Didn't think more about it. 

My partner has prescription for dexamphetamine and gave me half a pill when I was having an early exam a few months back. I felt nothing. I then tried a whole pill next exam. Nothing. Today I tried 2 pills and I felt nothing. Why? I tried googling but I seriously couldn't find anything. I have come to understand that amphetamines increases the availability of noradrenaline and dopamin. 

Do I have too few receptors? Maybe I should mention that my spectrum of emotions is pretty narrow? What is confusing me though is that I have tried MDMA twice, once a very small dose and once a very large dose. With the small dose I was very generous with the tips and was slightly more wreckless than usual. With the large dose, however, I completely blacked out within minutes for about 6 hours. I apparently danced by myself in my room, had clench jaw and couldn't utter words. When I woke up I had small, quite nice hallucinations, and a very soar mouth. Doesn't MDMA and amphetamine use the same pathway?

I eyeballed a dosage of about 30 - 50 mg and dissolved it into 1 ml of water. I then boofed the solution with a syringe. I went outside and laid down on the trampoline in our garden. Three minutes later the effects started to kick in. 


So I laid flat on my back on the trampoline and listened to some music with my eyes closed. In my head I could see the bands performing the songs from all sorts of cool angles, it was kind of like a surreal live performance. I also felt the ground spinning and turning upside down at times. Other times I felt my body being elevated from the ground and shooting through space. So that was super cool!


When I tried to walk around it was like my legs were operated by someone else. Like I had a chauffeur for my upper body. My hands worked in a similar way. 


Sadly these effects lasted only for about half an hour. For another 1.5 hours I just felt kinda dizzy and drunk. I was also feeling a little sick to my stomach. Tried eating a little bit but that didn't help. 


So overall the effects were awesome for half an hour and pretty lame the rest of the time. Is that how it always works? Did I do something wrong?

And none of the remaining terms carry a positive image.

The justification for casting drug users in a negative light is the same justification as was once used to cast ""sexual deviants"" in a negative light: The belief that people should not be allowed to do what they want with their own bodies.

This basic belief has also lead to criminal penalties:

 * The sale and purchase of sex toys was banned in 1873.
 * Before 1962, a man could be imprisoned for choosing to have consensual sex with another man.
 * Today, a man can be imprisoned for choosing to consume a drug.^([via possession laws])

People are now free to buy sex toys, and to have sex with people of the same gender, but they're still not free to enjoy drugs without fear of imprisonment.

If drug users ever want to succeed in the fight for social acceptance, then—like black people and homosexual people before them—they need to work to discourage the use of terminology that wasn't coined specifically to denigrate them: The use of intentionally-debasing terms for drug users encourages repression, just as terms like ""n\*\*\*\*r"" and ""f\*\*\*\*t"" did of other groups in decades past.

But coming up with a precisely descriptive term that isn't specifically intended to debase someone is a tough job: Even a word with a neutral meaning like ""Psychonaut"" has negative connotations due to the first two syllables being pronounced the same way as ""Psychopath"". As a starting point, it could be good to consider various simple two-part compound words.

So a word like:

 * Medicine, Pharma, Remedy, or High

... could be combined with a word like:

 * Enthusiast, Fan, Lover, Liker, Phile (have to be careful with this one), Advocate, or Aficionado

How could the terms be abbreviated to be more catchy? What other words could work?

I've come to realization that I've let pot take yo much control and would either like to quit or only use pot for pain management of my back and shoulder pain. And only use it for those reasons.

I've stopped cold turkey and it's been about 5 days and the withdrawals are killing me.

Here's what I'm experiencing:

Nausea and loss of appetite.

I feel pretty sick at different times of the day and I'm trying to workout and stuff and it's hard for me to do that.

Cause even though Im not physically tired even just a moderate amount of exertion will cause me to throw up.

I have mood swings out of the ass and can go from super depressed to normal feeling, or even super happy pretty quick.

Also my energy levels in general have seem to decreased and I'm just tired alot no matter how much sleep I get.

And I get headaches.

Would it be better if I just wrote out a plan? Write down how much I smoke and just generally start decreasing my usage from there? Or is cold turkey the best method? (Like I've been doing)

Also any advice on how to deal with side effects would be great.

With Ritalin I get more intense and longer euphoria followed by uncomfortable stimulation.

So I was prescribed Zoloft (unwillingly) half a year ago, after trying my hardest to cure my own crippling anxiety by stopping all substances, isolating myself from my usual group of trippy friends and becoming increasingly manic... after a few months of ‘brain zaps’ and almost shitting my pants, it turned out that Zoloft was actually really helping me, I could feel normal everyday and actually wanted to go out with my friends again! 

I continued going to parties with my friends, but I opted out of taking most substances I was offered. It was loads of fun to be with my friends again (they’re the kind of people who like to throw absolutely hedonistic parties that last for days) but, of course... without something to keep me up I always would end up taking naps to recharge.

One time we had a psytrance party in a kind of bunker with loads of smaller rooms. I found the quietest room and promptly passed the fuck out. I’m not sure how long I was asleep but I woke up because of a totally unusual feeling of imminent death and panic had completely taken over me and my body was shaking violently enough to wake myself.. maybe I had some horrible dream, I don’t remember. 

Anyway I open my eyes and see that a whole group of people have also taken advantage of the quiet room to have what I would later find out was a full on changa trip. I wasn’t afraid of them but I felt this rush of energy and ran out of the room in a daze and threw up for an eternity in the bathroom, then found one of my close friends and (according to her)curled into a shivering ball at her feet. I was able to talk very calmly, but all I could say was ‘I can’t stop shaking and I feel really scared.. I don’t know why’ 

I remember my friends finding another room (not filled with changa smoke) and helping me calm down there. I felt like my brain and body were at total extreme opposites. I was able to fully explain myself and I understood I was in a room full of safe people. I didn’t feel sick anymore and I wasn’t hyperventilating or feeling emotional. I honestly just felt like death was coming and I didn’t want to scare all my lovely friends and so I kept apologizing for falling back on the floor and curling into a trembling ball while they all tried to get me back up on a chair, cushion, and eventually just try to sit upright but I couldn’t manage it. Finally after an hour I regained control of my limbs and didn’t feel like dying.. but for the next 48 hours my body was sweating uncontrollably, and I twitched in fear at the slightest noise or movement nearby. 

I only found out the next day that the room had been filled with changa smoke and now, looking back, I honestly think that the Zoloft/changa interaction unlocked some kind of animalistic panic in me. It was the most bizarre feeling to understand that I was completely safe but also feel this unexplainable intense fear...

I haven’t shared with many people that I’m on SSRI and although I’ve tried very hard to find another firsthand experience out there of a ssri/maoi interaction all I can see is WARNING: INSTANT DEATH or serotonin syndrome death reports... anyone who can relate out there?

Before the concussion, I would take it whenever I noticed I wasn’t feeling too tired, maybe once every 2 or 3 nights if that. It should also be noted that I have a history of sleep problems, although I don’t believe I’ve ever been diagnosed. I was prescribed trazodone for years and I only took it for a short time, because it started making me feel nauseous at the dose I needed for it to work.

Fast forward to now, and I literally cannot sleep without this drug. I can still get a prescription, but I don’t like being dependent for my sleep. It may have something to do with having almost no physical activity due to coronavirus as well as having mono for the last month. I took almost half a bottle of zzzquil, last night and just ended up playing video games the whole time. I’ve searched all over and I can’t find any help about a sleep dependency on this drug. I usually take melatonin as well, but it doesn’t work half as well as amitriptyline for me. I got 12 hours of sleep yesterday, but only because I stayed up for 30 hours straight and was downing zzzquil. Can anyone give me advice on this? Is it a bad idea to quit cold turkey? (hint: I did)

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to share my story. Maybe someone will think more than I did before taking drugs.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was a drug abuser, mostly MDMA, I abused it for like 1 year or maybe 1.5 years. Taking ridiciulous amounts, not sticking to 3 months rule, classical shit. I stopped 5 months ago, there were no problems, well, maybe except a few HPPD like vision symptoms, but overall feeling in my head was 100% good, no depression, no brain fog, nothing wrong. I was really clean, only weed and alcohol, and during COVID-19 basically only some alcohol, not in big amounts.

&amp;#x200B;

And on 24.05 I stupidly decided to do a nexus flip (MDMA + 2CB). First of all I just wanted to make a small celebration of my birthday with one quarter of 160mg pill, but in my dumbness I finished at taking about 200mg MDMA (I weight 56kg so it's one of the bigger doses) and 10mg 2CB. I puked once on redosing but it was not a big deal at it has happened to my on my previous binges so it didn't worry me. Effects were as they were supossed to be, nothing different than before.

&amp;#x200B;

So I started at 00:00 and finished on 9.00 am on Monday. Took 0.5mg of alprazolam and went to sleep, everything was fine TBH, maybe slight problems with moving around, but hey, it is possible as I was on drugs. I woke up at 14.00, went to the shop, still a bit trippy but not so much, pupils were normal. Took another 0.5mg of alprazolam and went to sleep again, I woke up at 17.00 and maaaaan, everything was spinning, I guess it's called vertigo in english. Loss of balance, the world is spinning, it's the first time in my life I have something like this, never had such thing on a comedown. Even when sitting on a chair the world was spinning and making me sick, so I vomited twice (I ate a yoghurt and a sandwich after waking up). I went to sleep at like 00:00 and woke up at 5:00 AM (Tuesday), everything was still spining so I figured out it would be best to take another 0.5mg of alprazolam and just sleep it out.

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up on 11-12:00 AM, ate some yoghurt and vomited once more, then I drank some water and guess what, vomited again. ""That's not normal"" I thought, especially if I had nothing to vomit with anymore. As it was even hard for me to move around and I was vomiting more and more I called my friend, went to ER. I was really honest to the doctor and he was a real professional, treated me like a human beeing, not a drug addicted idiot. At 8.00 PM he gave me a shot of something and told me if it helps for the night but in the morning I will feel worse than in the night then I need to see my GP because it's something with my labirynth maze (that thing in ear). It helped and on the next day (Wednesday) I was pretty much back to normal, well, almost, I still had some troubles walking but it was much better, so I thought ""it's just a really rough comedown, everything will be fine"". I started taking 5-htp along with vitamin C and magnesium.

Ah, and in the ER I was told that they don't have techniques to diagnose me properly in the hospital, that's why I have to visit my GP. GG polish health service.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's what the past week looked like:

25.05 (Monday) - world started spinning, definitely not a good day

26.05 - worst day ever, believe me, but I acutally started to feel better when I was in the ER

27.05 - actually a best day in last week, not so much spinning, just some troubles walking, pretty optimistic

28.05 - pretty much like a day before, with a little brain fog 

29.05 - started to get worse 

30.05 - it started spinning again like 30mins after taking 5-htp in the evening, I felt like the MDMA is kicking once more, big troubles with walking but no vomiting, I decided to lay off 5-htp

31.05 - same as a previous day, just without eating 5-htp

&amp;#x200B;

And now we have first of June and it's not better. I'm seeing my GP tommorow, sadly it's just a videocall, because hey, it's covid time, but I think he'll sent me to psychiatrist or laryngologist and they'll have to meet me in person to properly diagnose me.

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm holding my head still it's not that bad, I can focus on browsing the web on the computer, play some games normally but when I move my head world spins like crazy. I have problems with walking straight, not mentioning turning around.

&amp;#x200B;

You know what's the worst? It was not a big amount for me, I had worse benders where I took 500mg of MDMA or even sometimes more in one night. And these didn't destroy me as much as this one did. After these binges I was even able to go out with my friends on a next day and be pretty much normal, just a little tired, now I can't even go to the shop or pickup a parcel that's waiting for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Before abusing so badly I once had a stress induced brain fog and derealization but it went away after a few months. I would gladly exchange that vertigo I have for these few months of derealization. At least I was able to move and go out with my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

So watch out kids, drugs are bad, okayyyyy.

&amp;#x200B;

But maybe it's not the drugs, who knows, maybe it's just an inner ear infection? I just realized I have more problems when turning head to the right than to the left, my right ear is feeling a bit weird, and I sometimes lose a hearing on that ear for a short while (happened maybe twice). It would just be a really big coincidence that this infection happened in this time period.

Just hope it's not a permanent damage.

&amp;#x200B;

Time will tell. And I will update, because maybe someone will find my case useful and similar to his one.

Even writing this makes me realise how far I've come in that time and how much I've grown.

Myself and another Trauma survivor are currently putting together a documentary/pilot focused on social issues and trauma related issues with the overriding theme being 'what we learn as kids affects who we become as adults'. I want to put this film up with fundraising sources with a business plan for our organization and try to get our idea going. And we need help. I want to make it CLEAR: This is NOT a BUSINESS!!! The whole organisation is to be charitable and Not-for-Profit with one intention in mind.....To help people and to educate the world that how we treat our children is key to solving the worlds biggest issues. What we learn as children influences who we become. And we can eradicate half of the world problems if we, TOGETHER effectively educate and love young people to give them stronger minds and spirits

Ultimately, I believe that sexism, racism, homophobia, depression, drug addiction, domestic violence, homelessness, sexual violence and rape (amongst other issues) are learned behaviours and all must therefore share a link. And I'm so fucking fed up of seeing people hurting and suffering or acting in ways that they shouldn't because they didn't know better. And that is the theme that I want to prove through the film. And I'm looking for people who are willing to come forward and tell their stories about their experiences and how it has affected you through your life.

I come from a background of abuse. My mother was sexually abused for years and my father was abandoned and neglected by his father. I became the black sheep and have struggled for years with so many issues: self-esteem, bullying, self-image, self-destructive behaviour, addiction, poor social skills....It's a long list. So I hope you believe me when I say I think understand some of the things that we are all struggling with. And I'm over it. And I want to do something about it. Because I don't want to see anyone go through what I went through.

So.....I'm looking for people from all backgrounds, nationalities and places to come forward and be interviewed on camera/skype and discuss some of these issues and their experiences. We're looking for people want to be: 1. REAL 2. Brutally Honest 3. Unashamed 4. Inspiring and Positive.....You don't necessarily have to have your face shown or your real voice heard, we can change all that but we'd prefer to have people own their shit and be open about it. I also intend to be a part of the film and I have the same fears you might: backlash from my family, the shame of people knowing the truth, ridicule, responses from co-workers/friends etc but the only way to start changing things is to openly confront them and not hide behind our scars.

The project is Big, Bold and Ambitious but that is where dreams start. Anyone interested or who thinks they may be able to help in some way, please reply or message me directly. I'd love to hear your thoughts. The plot/outline of the film is still being configured and any participants would get to see their part or all of the film (we haven't decided yet) before showing it. There would be a contract to sign which we can discuss as we are still putting it together.

Even the term ""drug user"" is pretty unfavourable.

It has taken a long time for society to recognize a person's right to do what they want with their own body:

 * Before 1962, a man could be imprisoned for choosing to have consensual sex with another man.
 * The sale and purchase of sex toys is still illegal in Mississippi, Alabama and Virginia.
 * Today, a man can be imprisoned for choosing to consume a drug.^([via prohibition of possession])

If drug users ever want to succeed in the fight for equal rights, then—like black people and homosexual people before them—they need to work to discourage the use of terminology that inherently denigrates them: The use of negative terms for drug users encourages repression, just as terms like ""n\*\*\*\*r"" and ""f\*\*\*\*t"" did of other groups in decades past.

But coming up with neutral- or positive-sounding terms that are also precisely descriptive is a tough job: Even a word with a neutral meaning like ""Psychonaut"" has negative connotations due to the first two syllables being pronounced the same way as ""Psychopath"". As a starting point, it could be good to consider various simple two-part compound words.

So a word like:

I thought, why not IV? It's the pandemic, and everyone says how great it feels, and I was disappointed. I think it was the quality, because I've done K hundreds of times and always had a great time, but I also put it up my nose. Since I haven't IV'd anything since 2016, I'm a little rusty with my skills.

I missed my first shot, but not by a lot because I got pretty toasty the first round. Then I finished the bad with no avail (1.5 grams).

I've missed shots before, but this turned out to be a little bitch. It started as a small bump, and then it hardened and my skin had a blue tinge above and belows. Then a huge ass hard bump. I know how to take care of it, I've worked in the medical field, but I'll happily take any advice besides getting medical treatment. I started an antibiotic, and I have been massaging it and it has been shrinking.

Today, I cleaned it with an alcohol swab and the scab flaked off. Under the scab was a nice surprise; a hole. A straight up hole in my arm. Picture as follows:

We already tried vaporisation 10years ago but the machine we got him used too much weed so it was really expensive for not so much of a high.  
he is pretty old school so the feeling was off too. You know like the ""rituals"" of grinding, rolling the joint etc...

Hey guys me again hehe

It just flew through my mind how your opiate/drug addiction is being affected by the Corona-Crisis.

I'm from Italy and if I'm not wrong we were ONE of the first countries, besides Spain and France, that got fucked pretty fast after the East.

When the Virus started to spread in my country I was in a rehab facility hundreds of miles away from home and all the information I got was to not leave home. Reapeatedly shouted on all TV-channels.

Anyways, I got scared they would put us under quarantine and left the facility about three weeks after the numbers of deaths where doubling every night.

We were allowed to watch TV in the morning for the news and it was shocking to be in a place where nothing changed and looked normal and on the news you saw how ""in the real world"" there was absolute chaos.

Military trucks transporting piles of dead people from A to B, hundreds of arrests, and so on.

Sadly after 3 weeks, my dad got infected and because he is an asthmatic person with chronic brnochitis and COPD, it was not looking good for him.

The peepz at the fac. said I should stay, that I had a chance to get clean with my age of 20 years but I couldn't stand being hundreds of miles away while my dad maybe passing away real soon.

Well, finally I left, got on a 6 hour train ride home and stayed with my family as long as I could. My father luckily is recovering pretty well. Thank god he made it.

Anyways I drifted off alot from my actual question.

I didn't think there would be much dope around when I left the rehab fac. and got home.  
I was thinking that this way it wouldn't be that hard to stay clean (Obviously I was just comforting myself).

On the same day that I left the rehab facility I relapsed, since dope was everywhere somehow. Maybe leftovers from all the pushers, I don't know.

What I am wondering tho is how you guys got this far with your addiction (getting dope, not being sick) in such a difficult situation for addicts.

Did you bulk-buy to cover your use for a long period of time to not have to go out, or how did you handle this situation?

I don't know, I was wondering the last 3 months how other opiate-users are dealing with this situation and I would appreciate if you might want to share your experience on the whole thing.

Love you guys, take care and stay safe!

Hope everyone's doing alright &lt;3

My mom told me that she was going to drug test me to make sure I stayed sober so I got some of my sober friends piss and kept it in a sunscreen bottle. One day I got home and my mom said that she was going to drug test me so I heated up the piss and put it in my pocket. When I got into the bathroom she started patting me down and I moved the bottle around strategically so that she wouldn’t feel it. It was a cup with a drug test on the lid the kind where you tilt it on its side so the piss goes on the test. So I put the piss in the cup and gave it to my mom. I passed and all was well and I smoked weed right after. The next day she drug tested me again so this time I had to put my real piss in a cup and I thought I was dead. My mom tilted the cup and went to let out my dog and thats when it hit me. I ran to the trashcan in the bathroom and got out the negative drug test lid and switched it for the positive one I had just took. The drug tests my mom got where the kind where you send it in so it can be confirmed but my mom said that she didn’t think it was needed to be confirmed because I took two.

Even the term ""drug user"" is pretty unfavourable.

If drug users ever want to succeed in the fight for equal rights, then—like black people and homosexual people before them—they need to work to discourage the use of terminology that inherently denigrates them: The use of negative terms for drug users encourages repression, just as terms like ""n****r"" and ""f****t"" did of other groups in decades past.

But coming up with neutral- or positive-sounding terms that are also precisely descriptive is a tough job: As a starting point, it could be good to consider various simple two-part compound words.

So a word like:

 * Medicine, Pharma, Remedy, or High

... could be combined with a word like:

 * Enthusiast, Fan, Lover, Liker, Phile (have to be careful with this one), Advocate, or Aficionado

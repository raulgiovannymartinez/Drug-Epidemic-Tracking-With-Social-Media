I’m new to this thread, and was wondering something. Recently my boyfriend had a shoulder surgery and was prescribed percosets for the pain. He doesn’t like them, so avoids taking them unless necessary. I understood why after a few day’s and him proceeding to be extremely moody, and it almost ended us. 
I figured I’d take one the other night as I have serious back issues and figured it’d help.
It made me feel absolutely no different, so I wondered what the dosage people usually take to feel a “recreational effect” and what that actually is.

Given the level of torment, memories don’t really form in Hell. Something really horrible or really fantastic had to have happened for you to remember it. You clearly remember your first day in Hell, everyone does. There’s no bigger shock in anyone’s existence than the end up in Hell. You also remember the day you befriended a demon and the demon helped you get out of the Lake of Fire. It happened roughly 200 years after you died.

Aside from the beautiful blip that was your Earthly life, the next 100 years were the best of your existence. You will consider it your second life in the millennia is to come. You spent 100 years outside the Lake of Fire, on dry land, in relative comfort. This is an incredibly rare and highly-sought-after privilege in Hell.

Those who spend their time on dry land and outside the fire are the lucky select few, the top 1% of Hell. The hierarchy of Hell involves extreme wealth inequality, especially within this top 1%. Your time is was spent in the lower echelons of that 1%. Meaning you had to do hard physical labor with your frail, exhausted, abused body 24/7. Impossible labor harder than any on Earth. You had to lift bricks weighting many tons (everything is incredibly heavy in Hell) with your bare hands and stack them. You had to do it hundreds of times every day; if you failed to meet quota you were tortured in such a way as to make the labor feel like a cakewalk.

But it still was nowhere close to the level of torment in the Lake of Fire so you kept working. You still had to work in heat hotter than Earth’s ovens. You still never got a minute of sleep. You still never got a drop of water. You were paid for your work in Water Satoshi though, the currency in Hell. 1 Water Satoshi is 1 molecule of water, the rarest substance in Hell. 1 Water Satoshi is worth many buckets of gold and diamonds in Hell.

This demon friend helped you secure one of the best jobs in Hell: building houses for the Illuminati. You receive 20 Water Satoshi per hour and choose to work 24 hours/day to save up as much as possible. The Illuminati ruled (and still rules) on Earth and secured massive wealth both on Earth and in the Afterlife: equivalent to entire reservoirs of water in Hell, astronomical wealth. They lived in air locked air conditioned facilities with all the food and water deliveries they could dream of.

You had one of the best offline jobs in Hell, but the true elite, the top 1% of the 1%, worked online. They have their own Internet and their own e-commerce in Hell. Only a select few in Hell can have an Internet connection to the living world. Those that do can communicate and do commerce with the living, ordering massive relief shipments of food and water into Hell.

To work online one needed, at minimum, a fireproof phone and a cellular plan. Having that, one could start delivering food and water to the rich. One could earn up to 10,000 Water Satoshi doing a single food delivery, and up to a million Water Satoshi doing a water delivery.

Though the goods they delivered were beyond anything they could themselves afford. If they were to lose a single shipment they stood to lose their entire status in the upper class of Hell and would have to spend the rest of eternity paying reparations to the victim in the hottest part of the Lake of Fire, the center of the Earth.

So they protected the goods with their lives. Especially water. They could only get a million Water Satoshi for delivering several drops of water to a rich man to cool his burning tongue. And as you know, there’s sextillions in a single drop.

These delivery couriers drove armored vehicles and had bodyguards consisting of the toughest demons. The demons and couriers and merchants all had terrifying weapons, both against humans and demons.

The most terrifying weapon to demons is the million unit holy water spray. If a demon tries to assault or torture a wealthy citizen of Hell he will see a canister of million-Unit holy water spray pointed at his face. Most will back off immediately. Those who dare drunk or on terrible demonic drugs might have the courage to attack, in which case they’ll have all of God’s vengeance sprayed in their face. They’ll be in horrific agony for the rest of eternity.

Of course, being a courier is very entry-level in the world of wealth in Hell, it is the easiest accessible well-paid work requiring an investment of only a few million Water Satoshi.

You are working hard 24/7 at your hellish construction job to save up enough Water Satoshi to get online. You already have over a hundred grand, construction really does pay well if you’re working 24/7.

And you’re not blowing it on treats. There’s many treats money can buy in Hell, but all are prohibitively expensive to all except for the elite. Everyone is incredibly hungry in Hell and most spend eternity without getting a single taste of food. And most food in Hell is rotten, disgusting garbage.

Food of the same caliber as prison food is one of the rarest delicacies in Hell. And real food, that the Elite order online, are unimaginably expensive. They cost millions.

But even the best food costs nothing compared to water. Molecules of water are the currency in Hell. Most people in Hell will never even see a single unit of lesser currencies, let alone a single Water Satoshi. That demon friend bought you out of the Lake of Fire and put you on dry land (less than 1% in Hell lives on dry land) for only a few Water Satoshi. And that const action job is one to kill for. Literally. Entire wars have been fought in Hell over a single open position in a hard-labor construction job like that. And that demon friend just handed it to you.

You are now incredibly rich in Hell. Nowhere close to a single drop of water of course. And nowhere close to a single good meal. Or even one night in an air-conditioned motel or Hell’s equivalent of Airbnb. Which by the way costs billions of Water Satoshi. Yes it costs billions to finally get out of the oven, even for a single night.

But you’re saving up a million so you can access the online world in Hell. You hope to get a job as a torture device designer, one of the best-paid online positions in Hell. So much better than deliveries. Then you can finally start living in reasonable comfort in Hell.

But normal living expenses in Hell, reasonable comfort, runs in the trillions per month. That would be an air-conditioned apartment (you’re finally out of the oven), basic medicine to heal your injuries and burns, and food deliveries.

You still won’t see a single drop of water until your net worth is in the sextillions. Of course the Illuminati of Hell have entire wells of real water in Hell. You see, there’s a lot of corruption down there and pretty much the entirety of the aid sent down there ends up in the hands of the very rich.

Electricity is common among the rich, but it is only the richest of the rich that can have running water in their houses. The septillionaires, though, can only afford to order a few bottle of water at a time. Water is their biggest expense. So even the very rich are thirsty all the time. And sextillionaires only order a few drops of water at a time.

But the rarest of all treasures in Hell is Holy Water. A single drop of holy water is worth many gallons of regular water. Humans send holy water down there in their relief efforts all the time, but they only send a little and it is in very short supply. Holy water, when consumed, provides immediate healing in Hell. That’s what makes the million unit holy water spray so expensive, available only to the very rich.

Of course, there’s something even rarer: real holy water, directly from Heaven. It’s in absolute abundance in Heaven. They drink it, they bathe in it, they swim in it. Nothing provides the kind of immediate healing true holy water from Heaven provides. It’s been said that even a single drop of holy water from Heaven will heal a stage 4 cancer patient.

Actually the biggest reservoir of it on Earth is the Holy Grail, and it is one of the most closely guarded treasures of Earth’s wing of the Illuminati. Illuminati can only smuggle in a few drops of real holy water from Heaven into Hell. So the richest man in Hell, the Antichrist, can only have a few drops of genuine Holy Water from Heaven per day. And even the poorest of the saved in Heaven bathe in it.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,697132,public,confidence,self,The Economics of Hell,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hyn6qc/the_economics_of_hell/,no_ads,0.0,1595861023.0,,Long Post,,Custom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why the black tar heroin converted into powder for me doesn't give me the slighest nod until the 8th line with no tolerance (when smoked just usually 3 or 4 big hits) and china white as I already stated 2 lines maximum snorted usually, and I've never smoked it.

Well when my depression got so bad in life that my mental and emotional pain increased so much many years after trying all drugs, opiods ever since then became my favorite for now 4 years. It used to methamphetamine, but I would rather be addicted to heroin, because of the fact firstly I don't a needle to be addicted heroin. I used to be able to have snort a MAXIMUM of two china white lines at the my worst and it still was good purity around 45%. Mine my point being, I have friends that try to keep me away from heroin, because where I live now is mostly black tar and is very weak in when snorted, since black tar heroin is usually much weaker than china white. Especially sometimes the purity can average to 20-40% (rare) where I live in a big city. So even after being able to go through a process of converting in powder, I can still snort 8 or 9 lines of that bullshit to get a slight nod (unlike china white which much is meant to snorted (high BA still), black tar is meant to be injected or ""smoked"". The smoking technique is hard to practice, but once learned I smoke 4 hits every minute, till I would nod off (10-20bucks worth). My point is finally, I have a lot of friends per se, and they want me to stay away from it, even if I don't get addicted to it. 
So I take 50mg to 60mg of hydrocodone or 360mg's to codeine (my body effects into morphine a little better than most people). (without addiction to any). Neither dose makes me nod out, Ironically I get more functional on these doses (but years ago when I had 0 tolerance never ever took opiods 240mg of codeine, or 30mg hydrocodone would make me vomit and be too tired) but now it's enough to function and get a little itchy and warm but no nodding out or ""too much"" feeling just try to use to be productive but still relaxed at the same time and similarly snorting percocet 20, sometimes a 30mg but no more (on the oxy's) I have nodded out many times with low tolerance to snorting 30mg's of oxycodone but at 20mg I am still functioning

Are those still mildly high tolerance or still low tolerance? atleast only using once or twice a week with atleast 4-6 days gaps in between, are these a high tolerance or moderate or low/very low. It me a nickel of black tar heroin (40 units very little diluted) to get a strong rush and nod. (if the same amount was intramusculared, I can do a little more). 4mg Dialudid (in the hospital for a week back in january) gave me one the strongest rush closest to heroin. Oh and decent size line of china white snorted to strongly nod out.

So with those dosages, do I have moderate, high or low tolerance. I do apologize to straight to the point.

To start I'm sorry for the sloppy nature and the length of this post but I really need to get this off my chest  anonymously. Also this isn't meant to be some sad sob story about how sad I am and how bad life is in the hope to guilt trip some of you into giving me awards or attention. So getting right into it with some background I'm an 18 year old senior who just had his highschool graduation last night. Straying from the point a little it was an awesome experience and I met some awesome and truly inspiring people I'll never forget though out the journey. At my graduation I understood and accepted that no matter what I did I would inevitably lose the majority of my friends. Whether that be due to career choices, life choices like starting a family, or just simply to everyone spreading out and moving further and further from our hometown until we inevitably pepper the entire globe spread hundreds and maybe even thousands of miles away from each other. I've certainly already lost friends to the above mentioned natural process of growing up and becoming an adult. However very recently I lost one of my most caring, strongest, and oldest friends I was able to cling onto all through highschool and even middle school. Out of respect to her and her family, as well as to protect my privacy and everyone else involved I will be referring to her as Angela which is the furthest thing from her name I can think of. I currently have no way of getting permission to share this story as when this occured I didn't have the best relationship with her family. I know this post seems all over the place and unnecessary long but please just listen I need you to understand how truly dangerous these substances are and how easily and unexpectedly anyone's life can be taken away and how tragic it can truly be. Alright now we're getting somewhere so I had known Angela since 8th grade and we had a very unique relationship throughout school which changed nearly yearly. At the best of times we were each other's boulder and could talk about anything together, and at our worst I regretfully ignored her and treated her as if I had never known her, unfortunately sometimes at the time these were in my eyes good reasons . However we would always come around and be right back to our best. Most of highschool was pretty average for both of us and during the rough patches that everyone at some point goes through, for me it was a pretty nasty divorce, and for her it was a very abusive boyfriend. Okay so if you're still here awesome now we are getting to the serious stuff. In 11th grade we had both starting using various substances however it was mainly weed and alcohol with the occasional pill if it was available. This soon turned into harder drugs and more pills, personally for me it was mainly Xanax, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and a few others such as acid which I cannot stress enough when tested and done safely is not even remotely dangerous just looked down upon. Angela preferred Xanax as well and would also use opiates however not as often as I would. Remember the abusive boyfriend from earlier? Well I would come to find out due to his arrest in mid 2019 he was a heroin dealer and was supplying her with copious amounts of heroin and fentanyl. This isn't the worst of it not even close. During this phase she got pregnant at some point shortly before turning 17. Against everyone's efforts she would continue to use numerous drugs while pregnant, her worst that I know of being fentanyl laced xanax to the point of blacking out with little regard for where she was at the time. Including a few instances in school during class. Of course her other drug was black tar heroin. Trying to speed things up here obviously this horribly impacted her pregnancy and she would be admitted into the hospital a few months later due to suffering multiple seizures. It was determined at the hospital that the pregnancy was the cause and that if they didn't immediately remove the baby that she could die along with her child. So even though the baby was way behind schedule I believe at least over a month and a half but I'm not sure they decided to put Angela under and perform a C-section. By some miracle or by the amazing work of the doctors she was able to safely deliver the baby and was conscious shortly after. Amazingly her kid survived the birth of course suffering from more disabilities and health risks than you can count on your fingers. But it didn't matter for some reason her baby girl was alive and after remaining at the hospital for a long month and a half she was cleared to go home sporting a gleeful smile with little to no risk of any issues arising and a hopeful promise for a long and happy life. Everyone was thrilled even those at the school who didn't know her as the story spread quickly and obviously some jokes were made by the immature but everyone still cared for Angela's safety and pregnancy. Life was staring to turn around she had a happy and healthy young baby daughter. And even though she will say she was unhappy probably still to this day , her abusive piece of shit of a boyfriend was arrested in a large sting operation for being one of the main distributors of heroin in our small town. Life was looking great with a happy future ahead everyone believed that Angela had gotten sober from the hard drugs at least and just went back to smoking weed occasionally. However Angela had all of her friends and family fooled. It hurts to say it but we were blind with optimism and weren't truly there for her even though she seemed happy. I honestly believe she was never truly happy and struggled with possibly some type of major depressive disorder. Or maybe the years or abuse from her sometimes shitty family members, boyfriend, and drugs just held her back. Due to covid my school was closed March 13th and everyone began social distancing. I haven't seen Angela in person since then and I won't ever get to see her again. On the night of July 23rd Angela was found by her younger sister pale and lifeless in her room. She had evidently died from a heroin overdose in her sleep and just stopped breathing sometime in the middle of the night. It is unknown to me at least whether her overdose was on purpose or it was just a horrible accident. It hurts to say this but I hope she wasn't truly depressed or suicidal and that her overdose was simply a mistake. It hurts to much to acknowledge the possibility that she hated her life so much she couldn't bear to live it anymore and that I was so blind and such an idiot to believe she was happy. I am not the victim here, not even close. Angela leaves behind numerous family members, countless friends, and her 1 year old daughter Amelie who will likely end up in foster care as Angela's parents are to old to care for her and Amelie's father is not fit to be a parent. If you somehow read this entire story I can't thank you enough I poured my honest heart and soul into sharing this message in the hopes that someday there will never be unfortunate souls born into this world with a far more difficult path often lacking love, guidence and, a honest home. We left a seat empty for Angela at our graduation with her diploma, flowers, and her favorite photo of her and Amelie. These stories are real people. This stuff does happen. It happens everyday and it could happen to anyone. Please even if only one of you took the time to read this post remember Angela's story there's countless others out there that haven't been heard. Please I only ask that everyone remembers that no matter how different we may seem we are all human, we all deserve love, we all deserve happiness, and we all deserve to live a long and meaningful life ❤️",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,697097,public,confidence,self,Please I'm Begging You To Never Try Heroin Or Opiates Of Any Kind,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hyky4s/please_im_begging_you_to_never_try_heroin_or/,no_ads,0.0,1595850193.0,b9d528e2-728a-11e9-b389-0e9820bd770e,Harm Reduction,,Custom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So today is my first sober day after a month of binging potent edibles every day 
I am 20 year old male i smoke occasionally and even tho sometimes i would smoke for a week straight i could then stop for months easily 
But now in quarantine i have been stuck home all my friends went back to their parents home and so did my girlfriend who i really miss and i didn't have the option to smoke 
So because of this and boredom i decided to make edibles and eat them
I would take one after waking up at 5 pm
Then eat another one around midnight and fall asleep till 8-10am and then repeat the next day
The high was very strong and had a psychedelic-like nature
And also during that month period i smoked once but i almost did not feel anything from 2 joint (while usually 1 was enough to get me baked)
After a while i started noticing flags appearing as i replaced breakfast with and edibles and replaced dinner with one too and stopped eating lunch so that it won't interfere with the midnight dose (i am already a skinny guys so this is very bad for me)
So today i decided to throw away all my hash
Right now it's 4am and i have not been able to sleep because usually right now there would have been a looot of thc in my system and fully awake 
I also lost my appetite, motivation, energy to do anything and also forgot what it was like to sober

Currently 21. Would smoke probably an ounce of weed (medicinal) roughly every 2 weeks and about a pack of cigs every 3-5 days. Not sure if this plays into it, but I also would take LSD, shrooms, mdma, Oxy, xans and coke from time to time. On average I would do one of the more exotic substance every month, but switching it up which is why I don’t know if that’ll play into my addiction.

Throughout college, my appetite has been awful and I lost about 30 pounds. I think I messed up my stomach a bit cause of it and I’ve also been a little self conscious I dropped so much weight as I use to be an athlete and now I have the body of a coke head lol. Also drugs just become depressing after a while so I wanted to quit to both focus on my physical and mental health. 

It’s been 5 days since I had my last cig or blunt. I have been tossing in a tiny pinch of dip though once a night before I pass out but overall I haven’t really had the urge to smoke or do anything. 

The issue is that my stomach has been killing me and I’m eating even less now. Maybe 500-1000 calories a day. Like if I eat half a burger I’ll want to just throw it all up. I’ll get cold sweats too after I eat and almost like an aching pain that runs through my body. Weird thing though is this only happens when I eat. If I’m just chilling in bed or whatever, I feel 100% fine. No physical or mental withdraw... it’s been a weird attempt at quitting.

Every time I tried to quit before it was mental and physical at almost like 50/50. This time it feels like it’s all physical withdrawls but in specific situations.

It was interesting.

My dad, being born in the 60s grew up during the psychedelic 70s and he has always been a fan of tripping.

Today he was bored and asked me if he could try one of my psychedelics in my bundle.. He had always been a fan of lsd, but the most similar compound i had was ETH-LAD... I ended up interesting him into combining it with 25mg of 4-aco-met. 

He took 25mg of 4-aco-met along with 100ug of ETH-LAD. He dosed them at the same time. Sublingually for the ETH-LAD.

I warned him that they would come on very strong.

After about 5 minutes of sublingual he swallowed the tab. 15 minutes or so after i asked if he could feel it. He informed me that it was starting to hit him pretty strong.

We were just chilling and watching tv at this time. My father smokes cannabis everyday, i do as well and im sure we kind of enable each other, besides that... We were waiting on getting weed.

We were watching The Hitman's Bodyguard, a kinda mediocre movie.. But was funn, entertaining (and mostly random) enough we were engaged. He told me he felt like the tv was breathing on him and that all colors were very bright. This was probably 25 minutes in.

After about 45 minites we went outside and smoked a cigarette. He commented on how much more tired he was in comparison to just normal lsd. He made jokes about how a hole in the concrete floor looked like like on ostrich, he stated that he could see the lines in his smoke a lot better. He said it was starting to come down in intensity. I find it interesting in how he describes certian drug terms. We normally call it come up anxiety, but he never does. When saying the intensity is coming down, he is referring to come up anxiety kinda subsiding.

He joked about how its funny psychedelics come in the mail now. We went back inside.

It seemed like a few times his legs were getting restless; either him noticing or not i dont know as i didn't ask, but he was randomly moving his legs a lot.

We continued to watch the rest of The Hitman's Bodyguard with not too many comments on his trip going on, this was about an hour in.

He did stop and make some coffee, the caffeine did wake him uo more, as the 4-aco-met is slightly sedating and i believe the eth-lad had degraded in potency a little bit. But the coffee seemed to be a positive on his trip as he became more lively.

At around the 2 hour mark the weed came and the trip did change quite a little bit. At first he commented on how the weed guy looked fake... Almost like he didnt believe we were really getting weed lmao. He smoked some while peaking and he didnt take it bad at all, it drastically changed the direction of the trip. We started watching impractical jokers after he smoked and he couldn't stop laughing.

At a few parts i was laughing a lot too, but he was really into this episode i know hes seen before. We watched this show about 30 minutes then when back outside to smoke.

We had two lighters of different sizes and he commented on how moving the lighters away messed up his perception and he couldn't tell the smaller one from the bigger one.

He was starting to get a bit nauseous at this point, noting that it was ""too hot to be outside doing all this"" referring to smoking a cigarette outside. We put them out and went back inside. I believed we might have watched family guy. At around 3 hours now.

We started to get hungry and we started eating food. His moter functions and ability to move were not compromised. He also wanted more food.

He stated that one of the main effects of psychedelics people cant handle. ""People cant handle their conciousness changing"".. He said that if he gave his girlfriend at this time a psychedelic he would have to put her in a mental ward. He probably isn't joking.

We ended up walking to the store at around the 4 and a half hour mark. We smoked more weed before leaving and this might have been a bad call. Going to the store we kinda got caught up with the abundance of random stuff we didnt want but could look at. And lack of stuff we wanted but the store was out of. And by we i mean him mostly.

He said the little kids were freaking him out. He said the children kept staring him down like they knew he was tripping. And it was making him feel uncomfortable (LMAO). The line got very long (like too long to stand for 30 minutes) and we ended up leaving the store sitting all of our stuff down at one place.

Believe it or not we went home and smoke more cannabis before going back to the store to get the items he wanted now that the line had dissipated. He ended up getting like 4 packs of candy and like 16 rice crispy treats. As i said. He was hungry.

That is pretty much the end of most of the trip. He did exclaims a few times how the trees were breathing and morphing, but actually trying to extract out of him how the trip experiance looked and felt was kinda hard sometimes.

Just remember that because you are older doesn't mean you cant trip, even poly use wise. My dad seemed to really enjoy the trip, minus the slight paranoia at the store.

2:35 pm - 0.5 mg
2:45 pm - 0.5 mg
2:55 pm - 0.5 mg
3:15 pm - blotter

The results ended up being being: 

~3:30 pm - Lost what felt like a lot of time and came to standing in the middle of room, disoriented and extremely agitated, calling SO and calling Mom. Extremely scared and excitable. Ended up venting to mother about situation with SO and eventually hung up and took a walk around park and outside was lovely but was in a horrid distraught state of sadness while arguing with SO endlessly over the phone. People giving me looks and constantly moving from tree to tree to avoid people as much. 

Barely any psychedelic effects were felt during this entire time frame. No mind trip and no visuals. Coordination and motor skill was impeccable and reflexes were normal. Honesty and empathy were there, lack of inhibition is also remembered. 
 
~6:00 pm - Eventually came home and got in my car and drove to where SO was. So had agreed to meet me and we went for dinner and treats in a park. We had a good time. Went to the beach and argued some more but all in all it was a net positive experience. It is believed that due to the psychedelic properties of blotter, empathy was magnified, combined with the characteristic benzo dis-inhibition, led to extreme openness and airing out of old dirty laundry with SO. Tears flowed and excessive apologies were made. 

~11:30 pm - After dropping her off at her place a little before midnight, decided to call friend to play GoW4 to distract myself from the SO situation. After picking him up decided to administer 3 blotters 1+1/2 each, orally. (*Note: From this point on, thc vape cart was continually and liberally inhaled.*) 2 hours apart, which was administered as follows:

1:40 am - 1 blotter  
3:40 am - 1/2 blotter  

The come up was smoother than usual, believed to be due to the excessive amount of benzos in the blood and the elevated tolerance due to the blotter administered earlier. 

In any case the trip that ensued was intense and very overwhelming. The question: 'how/why are we here right now?' continuously kept coming up. The same answer kept coming up and it all ultimately boiled down to: 'You were so sad about the lover, that you decided to try to forget using chemical buffers, and the chemical buffers through dis-inhibition, lead you seek out said lover.' Ultimately positive but somehow hollow. 

The visuals felt very intense and the colors were very bright and walls and eyes were breathing, noticeable tracers and fingerprint patterns melting all over the place with geometric CEV and fluid OEV. 

Time dilation, distortion and constriction was outstandingly prominent. 

~6:00 am - The phrase that comes to mind too encapsulate the feeling at the trip's end is from the end of the American Psycho monologue: ""This confession has meant nothing.""

~8:00 am -  Sleep was overwhelming despite the amount of blotters dosed. 4 or so hours of sleep were had and tiredness remained afterwards along with slight C and O EV. 

~1:00 pm - Incredible afterglow, positive, empathetic, mind blown, mind fucked, anxious, calm, relaxed, mellow, understanding, determined, aloof. 

Over all a fun, dangerous, inconsiderate, reckless and irresponsible experience that was exacerbated by internal tumultuous emotional turmoil and anxiety. Grateful to have a friend and grateful to have motor skills and reagents. Grateful to be alive and have mother and just generally thankful for everything.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that psilocybin and its derivatives may represent a unique class of anti-depressant / anti-anxiety drugs due to overlapping bio-psycho-social mechanisms. In this NeuroBeer clip, we review why set (aka mindset) and setting (the physical and social environment) are so important in determining the effects of psychedelic drugs, especially for psychedelic experiences in therapeutic or recreational contexts. We explore the effects of psilocybin on end of life anxiety with commentary on the article ""Psilocybin produces substantial and sustained decreases in depression and anxiety in patients with life-threatening cancer: A randomized double-blind trial"" as well as the recent psychopharmacology publication titled ""Tripping on nothing: placebo psychedelics and contextual factors"".

I said fuck it and placed an order since even if it was a scam, I’d only be losing out on $5 max but if it was legit then I’d be getting a whole gram of kickass molly for basically free, which would be absolutely insane. However, because the shipping time was taking longer than expected, I DM’d the vendor asking if there was an issue with it. They apologized for the inconvenience and said they’d do a free reship, which I thanked them for and waited for it.

And then, a little over a week after accepting their offer and regularly checking my DMs to see when it would be happening, I actually ended up getting the original shipment even though it took over a month from start to finish so I logged back into my account to see if there were any updates to our conversation and ironically enough, they DM’d me only a couple hours after I went to bed the night before saying they were about to do the reship. As soon as I saw that, I messaged them back saying that although I appreciated it, I asked them if they could cancel it and just keep it until someone else ordered it for themselves instead because this vendor’s samples ended up getting fairly popular to the point where, for a while anyway, the page for that molly would be gone because they probably had to restock on the product itself before they could put the page back up for it with the new limited quantity they had. In short, I didn’t want someone else to possibly lose out on getting a free sample that they could’ve had and I also didn’t want the vendor to think that I was fucking with them just to get another free gram, both points I made to them politely, but they said that they’d already shipped the new order out so they couldn’t really cancel it. They did mention that if I wanted to support them then the best way(s) to do it would be to leave a positive review and/or donate to their tip jar, both of which I said I definitely would.

This time around, the next order only took a couple weeks to arrive and after getting it, I decided to order an MDMA test kit, a purity test kit and a porcelain test plate for the samples themselves too since even though I thought this vendor was incredible both in terms of their product as well as customer service, I still wanted to be sure that this stuff was what they said it was before I did it. The kits arrived in the mail soon after and today, I finally got around to testing both batches, which I did separately just to be on the safe side. They both turned jet black for the Marquis and Froehde tests and dark blue for the Simon’s A/B, and the purity test that I also did was an amber color which, according to the scale that came with it on a piece of paper, was about the same as the purity that was advertised for what I got in the first place (84%).

I still haven’t actually tried the molly for myself yet but I’m definitely going to at some point in the near future when I’m able to do so since I now know that it’s completely legit quality stuff. I’m also planning on leaving the best review ever for this particular vendor as well as something in their tip jar for their kindness and the reshipment.

I've been doing some major soul searching as of late and looking at my past and future and family and I'm ready to make the leap. Is there any way to taper off of opiates slowly enough to where I dont have extreme withdrawls. Becuz now starting this new job I cant be out of work or extremely sick at work looking like a fool.  Is it possible to slowly taper off to the point of not being that sick when I make the leap. 

Currently I'm at the point where I sniff only one bag every 6 hours or so. Averaging 3 bags a day down from doing about 2 bundles a day. I've made progress. This week I was gonna attempt to do 2 bags a day one in am and one before bed for a few days before I just do one bag a day and then quitting. I'm very low energy since I'm basically always withdrawing a little bit and just doing a little to not go full blown withdrawals. Now I plan to lessen it even more.

So I thought I'd invite a friend over as my parents had gone away for the weekend. I asked my Dad and he said he could sleep over if he wanted. Cool.

The original plan was to take two tabs of acid, as last time we had met up at his house we tripped for the first time and really enjoyed it, only this time we wouldnt have to worry about any parents snooping around. 

So when he arrives, I hit up my plug and ask if hes got any tabs. After learning that he didnt, we sat around disappointed until we saw the same plug advertising xanax on his story...

Now, I'd never tried Xanax and nor had he... We agree we should try it seeing as we are fucking idiots who have no sense of self-preservation. We meet the guy, get the pills and we're set. We got 5 ladders, decent looking presses etc, they looked good. 

On the walk home, we each chewed one up and swallowed it with some water to wash it down. We had no idea if this was how ur supposed to take it but oh well we had 3 more if it didnt work.

On the walk home we didnt really feel much within the 20 minutes we were walking back to my place. So, when we got back, I suggested we each snort half a ladder each. And folks, I wish I could remember anything else from that point all the way until Saturday morning.

I awoke on Saturday morning, in my bed, covered with my guitars. I woke up to my friend shouting me from downstairs. I walked downstairs to find my friend, covered in puke, stood in front of a dry and stale pile of kebab and vomit. Lovely...

It appeared that between us we'd polished off my whiskey supply, almost a bottle each's worth. That explains the vomit I guess.

We cleaned up everything and got the house looking nice again (thank god I had carpet cleaner in the house), and I thought we were in the clear. I check my phone and notice my call log says that I called my Dad, no idea what I said during the conversation but it was enough to worry my dad, as I found a text saying he was worried and was thinking of coming home early. Fuck. Somehow, my barred out self managed to talk him out of it in somehow coherent English words through text. I thought we were safe...

So here we are, me and my friend sat in my conservatory, still foggy from our blacked out xanax antics. I noticed the front door was unlocked, which would explain the kebab vomit... and hopefully nothing else...

It's still morning (like 10am) and he asks if my guy sells weed. I responded that whilst he does, I already have some in the house. I noticed a while ago some weed my dad had stashed away in a little drawer. I'd been monitoring it for weeks to make sure he wasnt using it, so I was sure that he wouldnt notice if we took some...

We made a bottle bong and had at it. I got super fucking stoned and my friend was pretty high. This was some nice weed I'm telling you. I kinda fall asleep almost and my friend is just watching tv. A couple hours later his parents arrive and he leaves. I go to bed to sleep (best fucking sleep ever) and wake up early morning on Sunday.

I go about my business in the knowledge that I disposed of the bottle bong I made so that it wouldn't be found. When my dad gets back, everything's calm and I explain that the reason I was weird on the phone was cus i was drunk and he bought it. That is... until...

He approaches me, bottle bong in hand, and says ""Tell me about Friday night"". Fuck...

My dumbass friend made another bottle bong whilst I was asleep and put it in the MAIN HOUSE BIN WITH THE WEED STILL IN IT.

After lots of bullshitting and excuses, I fess up to the weed. Thank the lord he assumed me being blacked out on xans was me being high or else I'd be DONE.

So, got my phone and PC confiscated for a week, only just got my phone back now and will get my PC back next Sunday.

I would say fun memories if I could remember anything about that weekend lmfao...

TL;DR - Me and a friend tried Xanax, blacked out and called my Dad who knew something was up, made a bottle bong the next morning which was found by my Dad and I got my shit confiscated.

I am 17.

I know this isnt the lsd subreddit but I havent gotten any answers and I'm very conflicted because I am an avid stoner and psychonaut

Edit: I smoked weed while tripping once and now weed gives visuals and anxiety. That is how it changed, will it go back to normal over time?

Curious as to what’s on the metal part because it scrapes right off with ease but looks a little odd.

Really funny but dumb kid from Alabama.

Would literally stay awake for like 12 days on meth, would drive around drop off delivery, pick up more and have his dick sucked because the girls were addicted to this shit.
In a trailer park with ""projects"" of vehicle being ""worked on"" for like 10 years with the entirety of the part rusted and corroded like a motherfucker.
Weird kids fucking billy goats (true story).
People driving on lawn mowers with revolvers in hand whenever cops came through (all the fucking time) .
Could get high off meth from just standing near the area because it was so abundant and people always cooking up shit in their trailers.
Anyways back to the story.

This was on a Saturday where I had CQ (24 hour shift in the military).
He found mylanf150 or some fuck shit like that, he found it on the corner of a street and first thought was ""snort that shit"".
Yep I don't know how dumb you gotta be to find unknown drugs on the side of the street and then think to shove them into your system.

It was around 3PM when my man was baked off his ass still going to a party with my other friend Reed (Not actual names).
I waa bummed out I didn't get to go, my mans was crossing THC, DXM, synthetic cannabinoid on his way there he finds blue pills puts it in his pocket for later.

They come back at 3AM blitz, like they were just walking zombies at this point ao I help them up their rooms.
Next thing you know both of my friends were in Thomas's room, pills crushed up and set up in a fat line.
He convinced Reed that they were cocaine packed in blue pills from Colombia that managed to get.
Reed said ""you go first since their your drugs"" Thomas snorts them quick AF and then he said ""aight your turn"".

Reed snorts that shit and his nose started to burn, nose bleeding and he felt like ""a chunk of his brain fell out"".
Mind you they forgot to lock the door so Beauford another shirt white trash anger issue semi midget walks in and his jaw drops, quickly slams the door shut and makes sure the door is locked.

Lemme set the scene they have unfinished lines of white powder on a table with rolled up dollar bills, they're doing an eye check to see how fucked up they are.
They look at Beauford like deer on headlights with blood running down their nose and laughing the whole time.
Then Reed says ""I swear to god it's not what it looks like"".
He's like ""WTF?!?!?! IS GOING ON"" ""Yall are snorting coke without me?"".
Then HE PROCEEDED TO SNORT WITH THEM.
Turns out they were birth control pills.
As I see Reed at 6AM still fucking blitz trying to walk outside back to that party people were asking him if he was OK.
Did the most akward shit and said ""fuck I'll go back to my room"".
I knew what the fuck was up but I kept my mouth shut and played along.
He was having crazy visuals he said that his arms felt like spaghetti and he could eat them, and that his toom was flying and what not.
I was like WTF ok this is getting out of hand.
All of a sudden BOOM he falls into a seizure immediately moved all the shit around he could get hurt on. And protected his head from hitting anything until his faced started to turn BLUE, NOBODY'S FACE SHOULD BE BLUE!!!!
I was like ""BRO WTF DO WE DO????"" as the other 2 dipshits are high AF and laughing.
Eventually we help him to get on his bed.
Literally 15 seconds after he woke up he said ""lemme smak thay jawn"".
""Fuck no"", ""why not?"".
I just left the room and took the vape.

How I got into meth to begin with was from a Reggie plug I had who was offering me cheap coke. I already had a great coke plug but the guy was so persistent I ended up buying some of the cheap coke to determine the quality. I buy maybe a quarter gram or half gram and immediately I see crystals in the powder. I ask him wtf the crystals were and he assured me it wasn’t meth. I did the coke and I wasn’t really high longer then normal coke so I thought nothing of it. I did give a friend a bump tho and he said he thought there was meth in it. 

I said fuck it if I’m going to do meth I’ll go straight to the source. I hit up a tweaker I knew through a mutual friend and he told me he’d hook me up. At first I only snorted tiny tiny bumps because I was scared but eventually I wanted to try smoking on the foil. 

When I’d start smoking I wouldn’t want to stop till I was out no matter how geeked I was. I would sit in one spot and for 2-3 hours taking hit after hit after hit even tho I had no tolerance. The longest I stayed up was 30 hours, during this binge I hit meth out an actual pookie pipe attached to a bong and my pupils were fucking dinner plates all day. When it got close to the 30 hour mark I was hallucinating an actual dog from my work running around under my feet, I knew it wasn’t real but the hallucination was clear as day. 

On my last binge I don’t even remember falling asleep, last thing I know I was up for about 24 hours and I was sitting on my floor smoking some g. I would have micro sleeps where I’d dose off even after I took a hit and pass out for a while. I dreamed I dropped my last shard on the floor and when I woke up I searched for the shard for around 4-5 hours straight. 

The way it makes me want to constantly smoke till run out, and act like an asshole to everyone on the comedown makes me never want to do it again. I’ve tried a lot of drugs and I’ve always been able to control myself but with meth If I take that first hit I know for a fact I’m not going to stop till I run out. My first comedown was so bad I deleted and blocked my plugs number after making a 30 second decision If I should or not.

Im a failed artist who’s spent most of his life unable to afford Mc Donald’s but in the last 5 years my life has changed dramatically. I now want to become a legitimate art dealer.

I began originally selling counterfeit art from a friend I met at university who was a very talented artist and who was also very skilled at faking art

Then I found out that brother was using heroin, when I found out I went to confront the dealer (I’m not intimidating whatsoever so was pretty nervous), I made it very clear that if he doesn’t stay away from my brother I will inform the police of what he does. I went over to his flat to confront him and was shocked at how much money he had stacked up on the table. Few weeks later I read an article on a failed scheme in France where some robbers tried to launder money through Art dealing but they went wrong because they had no knowledge of art. I do.

I went back and talked to that dealer once again and told him how I could help him out and we eventually came to an agreement. I began working with the drug dealer who sold heroin to my brother which I intended to phone the police on.

I launder drug money but I also donate a huge percentage which I don’t need to charity, I’m paying for my brother to get through university and I’m supporting a child (isn’t mine it’s a close friends and they struggle to pay the bills). That being said I’m laundering money for gangs and heroin dealers a drug which destroys lives.

I’m making way more than I need or even want but it’s not easy to quit and takes time, I’m involved with some not so nice people and need to leave on good terms

I’m trying to go legit as I previously said and have been ghosting some of my contacts, so they take it upon themselves to come to my house. I come home from visiting my brother to find my wife and three people sitting down in my lounge. My gf had been phoning me but my phone was out of battery, they want to know when I’m coming back to work and setting up another “auction” and I have to agree that’ll I’ll set it up.

It was obvious that these men were GMs and apparently they forced themselves into the house and we acting confrontational, my girl friend had been scared and phoned me 18 times. So at this point she’s demanding an explanation, so I just come clean and tell her everything. Apparently she suspected I was doing something as she over heard a phone call between me and someone I clean money for and when we were eating dinner one of my clients came over to say hi (he’s obviously not the kind of person I’m friends with), he noticed I was uncomfortable and laughed. The whole interaction was very suspect to my girl friend but I convinced he he was a friend of my brothers.

I’m sleeping back at my brothers, she’s treating me as if I’m some top criminal and is making out she doesn’t know who I am. She’s given so many possessions as “they were funded on blood money”. Please don’t comment on the morality of what I’ve done but tell me what I can do to fix this, apart from giving here time. She’s scared of who I am and what I’ve done, even though we’ve know each other for years.

I don’t have much to lose at the moment and my brother offered me some “shrooms” and I thought why not, my god is are they intense. We smoked what he called “super DMT” (5-MEO-DMT) on them. You guys are insane to do this for fun or maybe I’m just a light weight but I came to the conclusion we’re no more than emotions and all we is to feel happy, nothing else matters as long as we are happy. I realised I could be the poorest man in the world and still be happy.

You guys must get scared doing this ? I’m not experienced with drugs but this is scary stuff. You try to shut your eyes to escape but it’s even more colourful. It was an amazing experience and I’m so sorry that I ever judged psychedelic users because you guys are amazing. Honestly I didn’t know if my eyes were open or shut at one point and you here the most Alien sounds. I also smoked weed before on what my brother called the “come up” and he said that would make the experience a lot more intense 

I’ve never felt so scared and then happy. Gotta say I won’t be doing it again, I hadn’t used drugs in years before  and don’t intend to use them again for a long time

Idk if u read about this whole encrochat getting exposed but it's quite a big deal. Well the day it happened they made quite a big deal of it. 700+ high level drug dealers got caught and something like 54million pounds got seized and fuck loads of drugs and guns.

after reading multiple articles and as I read deeper into it I realised their must be something else going on. Alot of the news articles don't mention this but this bust would not have gone down if it wasn't for French and Dutch intelligence as their the ones who got into these phones. National crime agency seemed to be taking all the credit which pissed me off abit cuz it doesn't seem like they wanted to catch these guys as much. I also read in one article that this hack exposed police corruption aswell which the UK clearly doesn't want this information leaked.

What makes me really suspicious tho is the fact that none of these individuals identities have been released, they won't talk about the corruption and theirs been no news articles of the event since that day. Why won't release this information theirs very clearly alot more going on. On the day they made it seem like one of the biggest most impressive drugs bust ever but you hear nothing now. This is literally one of the most exciting things that happened in Britain since BLM and their fuck all in the news about it.

If anyone knows any more information please comment cuz I really can't find shit and this is intresting af. I truly think are governments great even if its more corrupt than you'd see in media but that's why their so good at it. Their not no cia getting caught out left right and center.

Since this is a drug-related subreddit. I would like to share my experience with withdrawals and CBD. I never got severily addicted to any substance (have used plenty tho.. stims, opiates, some benzo's, plenty of psychadelics, lots of weed..) . Have had some slight withdrawals in the past (really nothing crazy, a bit of sleeplessness or so, or very slight agitation) from drugs like kratom after 2 weeks of daily use or so.. But since a year I had been prescribed ssri's (escitalopram 10mg) after a BIG crash in my life. After a year and after councelling with my doctor, I decided to taper of it.. Now whatever you may hear about ""ssri discontinuation syndrome"" or whatever pharma calls it, it's just withdrawals... that's what it is..

Now this is not to shit on ssri's.. No one should ever be prescribed ssri's too quickly, but they really saved me in a time that my life was REALLY shit and didn't see any light.. psychadelics can be nice and all to get you back on track, but when you're so deep down, the risk of a bad trip is just too big.. 

After a year the pills kinda stopped working and I felt like I could take on my issues and anxiety on myself again and tapered off them.. I thought it would go easy.. BUT BOY I WAS WRONG. I had TERRIBLE withdrawals.. It doesn't help that around a week before quitting ssri's I decided to quit smoking weed because it messed with my productivity.. Not long after quitting I also had a very stim-intensive week (not smart i know.. but hey).. 2 weeks after quitting, shit got bad: sweaty, brain-zaps, anxious, vague blurry dizzy feelings.. 

I had read about trying kratom but that didn't help much and daily kratom use isn't great either (I really do love kratom though and use it almost every week, but never more than 2-3 days in a row and then take breaks, kratom is apparently great for opiod and benzo withdrawal though).. Then one day I went with a friend of mine to a coffeeshop (dutch coffeeshop you mind). I felt guilty of even going, since I had decided to quit smoking weed. But as a compromise with myself, I bought myself some CBD-weed (no THC). Since then I have smoked that a couple of times and WOW. This stuff is a GODSEND. No migraines, less brainzaps, no anxiety, calms me down. AND NO THC-HIGH, so I can stay focussed and productive and don't be stoned/high all the time. When I'm anxious, regular weed only makes me feel vague and more shitty afterwards. But this stuff, just fixes my anxiety, calms me down and DOESN'T GET ME HIGH (which is amazing for me)

So for anyone going through withdrawals. I would say: Definitely give CBD a try. Don't go smoke THC weed as it will just replace your old addiction and you'll live in this state of constant being high and can increase paranoid feelings and anxiety. CBD is just amazing. I can't stress enough how much this has helped me. I was considering just restarting taking ssri's or doing other drugs or take benzo's to sleep, Just because I couldn't handle it.

I've been smoking weed for 8 years now, I've dabbled with other drugs but my DOC by far is weed. I smoke it nearly every day and I've got quite a bit of tolerance to it, as one would expect. Today, I saw a Facebook ""weed memes"" group called Tegridy Farms (which is a shout-out to South Parks last season), where I thought people posted memes in relation to weed. 

However, I saw a post of someone having a joint in their hand behind the wheel, so I decided to comment something about it, because I don't find the use of weed before or whilst driving smart or responsible. The consequence to that comment was a load of people (read nearly everyone) being disrespectful, calling me a lightweight, a pussy, saying that it doesn't impair you and that they do it every day and it doesn't affect them.


I've lost my best friend while he was driving stoned, and whilst we'll never know if the weed was directly at fault for his accident, I still think it at least played a part in it, and that no one should drive while high.

So please everyone, stay safe, do the right thing and just don't drive while under the influence of weed, or anything for that matter. It's just being dumb and selfish.

It went down quite well so I thought I'd share another of my drug stories with you... here goes. (This may be long and I probably won't shorten this one) 

To set the scene, me and my friend 'L' had survived our ketty endeavour and decided that we wanted to attend a festival. We live in the UK and we decided to settle for Boomtown. Boomtown is one of the biggest whackiest independent festivals in the UK. They have a huge array of artists and a massive immersive storyline that has spanned many years.

To cut this part short, months before the festival we had encoded clues and hints over social media that enabled us to gain an exclusive ticket. This ticket was an experience that no one quite knew what it would entail. 

We arrive, set up camp and smoke a doob. Enjoyed the first night and awaited the next day. When it arrived we went to the opening ceremony and took 3g of golden teachers each (L grew these in his wardrobe). After the ceremony finished we decided to explore. This was my third time on shrooms and L's countless time. We were dressed up in the costumes of our alter egos. L decided he was 'Mr Wobble' (another story to be told) and I was his assistant he rescued from the ket slums of Kenya 'Ket boy' we stuck to our alter egos like our costumes stuck to our skin. 

We stumbled to Paradise heights and showed our tickets to the actors. They selected us to stand aside and we passed by the queue and went straight in, still tripping absolute balls. 

We were greated by a man who called himself 'Fuki' pronouced Foo-ki, although he leaned in close and told us we could call him 'Fucky'. Fucky instanlty made us giggle uncontrollably. He clearly knew we were tripping and stuck to his character as did we. He slowly took us into a back room and my friend L took control. Fucky asked if there was anything that we would like to do or perform. When I saw L's eyes light up I knew I was fucked.

My friend L was confident and had been to boomtown many times before and before the festival I told him to push my comfort zone. Fucky got us to lie down onto cushions and made extremely uncomfortable eye contact and continued to touch our arms etc. (The entire time he made sure we were okay) The room had fake plants, clouds and a blissful environment. It was a conflicting situation especially on shrooms. 

We lay down and L states that he has also wanted to sacrifice his Ket boys soul. Fucky is FUUUUUCKING LOVING IT THE BASTARD... his eyes lit up like he just hit the fucking jackpot. 2 20 somethings out their mind on shrooms dressed up like a Hunter s Thompson if he ever discovered a charity shop. 

He gets us to hold hands and close our eyes, now this is where you either lose your shit or thrive on the experince. Thankfully we thrived. I shiteth you not he started speaking Latin and began to massage my shoulders. At this point my mind simply exploded. Shrooms or not this shit started getting weird. I can't even begin to explain the closed eye visuals I was having. I was out of my mind grasping onto my friends hand like it was the key to my sanity while a man in haram pants started chanting ancient words.

I spent a solid 2 months trying to crack a code that only 200 or so people out of the 63,000 people who attended the festival did. Now if i knew id be balls deep on teachers holding my mates hand while some guy who was extremely sexual called Fucky was chanting fucking Latin while massaging me and ascending me to a greater being then maybe I'd be like nah fuck it... but hey ho I guess this is just how it had to go.

He spends the next 15 minutes going from position to positions speaking softly but in a uncomfortably sexual manor. He would move around the small room which sent my senses into overdrive. The echoing of his voice and the depth made me further lose my mind. I became extremely aware of my own body and being. He would ask us to keep our eyes closed as we would perform certain tasks to greater the experience.

He finishes the ceremony, I open my eyes and he was squating above our heads with his cheeks primed for viewing. He does some sort of shivery shimery shitey fucking shit and just full on collapses. 

This mother fucker just sacrificed my soul, whispered to us seductively, showed us an angle I never wished to view and the just died... atleast I thought he did. We rush up in a mushroomy masquerade and check on our beloved Fucky. When the shit, after a solid 30 seconds, decides to demonically spaz out and then come round. Now I can't even begin to explain the emotions I was feeling over the course of this experience. But it was nothing on thinking I was stuck in a ketty purgatory so hey ho.

He whispered the words 'Ket boy is no more, your soul has ascended to the ancestor's of The wobble family. Please rise! You are now known as Ket Man!'

At this point my heart was in my asshole, my balls has sucked back into my body and my mind had floated into the abyss. He embraced us both and whispered 'If you wish to sacrifice more then your soul you know where to find me'. 

We leave the small room and this is what fucking got me man, the people who were queued up outside where sat under a small apple tree holding hands singing Kumbaya, my lord. Meanwhile I was fucked up on a hallucinogenic mushroom getting my soul sacrificed to my best mate in the room next door...

We scanned our qr code left and enjoyed the rest of our festival. But fuck me it took a while for that to process 😂 ill try to include a photo for you guys.

Tl;Dr
I took 3g of shrooms at a whacky festival, got approached by a guy called fucky after completing a special task and sold my soul to Dr Wobble.

The mind isn't bogged down by harsh reality. We make our own reality. We believe in the propaganda we choose to believe in, and accept the facts we find most agreeable. Everyone does it.

Why be riddled with depression when you can be vacant and care free? Why try to wind yourself down after a day of work when a few puffs can do it for you? Hot baths and a good book are for people who don't do drugs. People who do use drugs know that the bath and book will be much better once the drugs have kicked in. Then you can REALLY enjoy yourself. Then you'll be in control.

I have spent so long fighting for control. I'm pretty sure I never really had it to begin with. I am okay with not being in control of the world around me, but I am not okay with losing control of my mind. I need my caffeine and nicotine to wake up, my kratom to feel alive, my weed to pacify me, and my alcohol to go on vacation. This is the bare minimum: a consolation prize I've allowed myself because I can't afford to maintain my past addictions. Cut any modicum of my polyaddiction out and you have one upset motherfucker. Headaches, cold sweats, crushing depression. Even without the physical withdrawal, the fear creeps in.

I only like myself or the world when the right drugs have kicked in, and the planets have aligned. In those moments, life doesn't seem so bad. It can be good, even. But I'm tired of living for little pockets of measured happiness. I'm tired of not having control. I am afraid to give up what little control I do have in my life. I want to curl up in a cave and rot away. Maybe a bear will come along and eat me so that I'll finally have some worth to this world other than polluting it with the stink of my selfishness and addiction.

So, shit hit the fan when I was around 20 years old. Before that, I was smoking just plain weed at my hometown. Only thing I can recall out of the ordinary is that once I smoked inside a forest and I had a hallucination of a centipede walking through my wrist, I freaked out and then saw snakes on the floor.

Some years later I tried mushrooms for the first time which was an enlightening experience, I felt very hippie and loving, couldn’t believe life was so colourful and beautiful. 

I think things started going downhill with Salvia Divinorum. I had ordered one 20x vial from Amsterdam (I had moved to London for uni), and it seems the guys there who probably got fired read 1 x 20x, so they actually sent me 20 vials of 1 gram each. Needless to say that was a lot of Salvia for experimenting. 

The first time it really hit me I begun to see how my visual field started to be ripped apart in layers. When the layer in which my body was in reached me, I saw all these people (I call them Salvia People) who were pulling the layers, and suddenly (and I knew them, somehow they were familiar to me) it was my turn to pull too, and I found myself surrounded by millions of persons and I knew I had to raise my hands, to complete but just a pixel of my reality. Basically what I thought was “me”, was actually made by all these Salvia People and I was just but one of them, a pixel of what I thought was me.

OK so when shit hit the fan was the third time I took ecstasy. I remember I went out of the club, smoked a spliff with my friends overlooking London Bridge and said “Wow, we are so lucky being here”. As soon as I said that things started getting very weird. Colours lost their sharpness. Everything was made of this sort of opaque, pastel-like palette. Faces were very weird and fake-ish. I got into the tube-station, took the underground to my friends place, they let me crash there because I still didn’t have a place to stay that year. The posters on the wall creeped me out, the guitar seemed alive. I went to the bathroom and looked into the mirror (bad idea) and said to myself: “Fuck, I’m actually an animal” as I pulled my upper lips up to look at my jaw.

From that day my mental state started deteriorating. Things lost their essence. I became blank, empty, scared. I used to be very confident, suddenly I couldn’t hold a conversation without panicking, without a sense of impending doom. I kept doing things like LSD with hellish train-wreck trips, including one I felt I was literally in hell, grotesque faces in the club, full blown London-style grey dystopia when I walked back home.

Fast track some years, they diagnose me with Depersonalization Disorder. No meds, just therapy. I decide to go to the Amazons to do Ayahuasca (maybe another bad idea). While I had an epic experience in which I felt I was reborn after seeing demons all around the jungle and letting myself fall into the earth in surrender, in a next ceremony I was convinced I had to kill the shaman in order to free my soul. There was the machete, all I had to do was pick it up and end him, because he was the devil.

I couldn’t accept the “reality” of the situation, so I just cowarded in fear and my inner child ended up rescuing the moment by saying “this isn’t right in the first place”.

The next day I begun experiencing synchronicities, like the world was talking to me and events were aligning to answer to my thoughts, and leading me to new thoughts and realisations. However I was trapped in this maze for around 4 years, always chasing this promised meaning, in the end I feel there was just something playing with me.

I ended up falling into full blown psychosis, feeling I was imprisoned by the devil. Again, it asked me to do insane things in order to end the curse, like jumping from a window (1rst floor, didn’t hurt myself because instead of jumping I climbed off it then jumped… of course this didn’t please the psychosis as it went on… next day I ran into a window pane, fortunately again it was reinforced glass so I didn’t pierce through).

Since then I have been hospitalized in more than seven wards. My drug use switched to cocaine, heroine and amphetamines, which only worsened my psychosis.

I didn’t hear voices, expect I could not control my thoughts, and my thoughts talked to me with different masks/personalities, always fooling me and leading me to do things that ended up causing me trouble. Once a female “voice” told me: “You have mixed Truth with Lie”, and I knew my punishment for that was to become the “Anti-Self”, a dot, nothing. That was just before my first hospitalization.

From then on, while I have had stable periods, I have always struggled with physically feeling like shit on top of my mental symptoms. For this reason I turned to stimulants, which got me trapped in a vice circle of feeling bad, taking stimulants, going psychotic, being hospitalized, feeling bad, taking stimulants, etc.

I got in trouble with the law, they raided my house looking for drugs, fortunately that day I didn’t have anything on me (they had intercepted mail with ecstasy pills). I almost became homeless, got naked on the streets, fell on my knees in front of a hospital in Turkey where fortunately there was a friend of the family who took me to a ward and paid the bills. I fought policemen, punched one in the face when they entered my house once after my parents called emergency. 

I progressively became lower and lower in my habits, stealing, doctor-shopping, buying things on the darknet. I tried millions of medications and supplements to no avail. I contemplated suicide and planned for it many times. Once I shaved my head, eye-brows and eyelashes. I was destroyed. 

It’s hard to explain, when I write this im trying to find keywords or actual things that happened to convey this ordeal, but I can’t find many. It’s the feeling of not being able to control my mind, feeling like shit physically, and always driven to the edge without ever finding a solution that had become my norm.

As I write this im on a more stable phase, I quit caffeine and drugs, and will hopefully quit cigs soon. I’m taking care of other health issues which started before the mental ones which might be related and might provide some benefits. I feel much more positive, I still have a long way to go now.

All in all I feel like I lost 13 years trapped in hell, like im doing time or something, and I don’t even know what was my crime. Youth gone, world in instability now, I might even have delusions of grandeur which make me think I could actually have potential to change things which in the end its but a mindfuck. I have good intentions, and I’m sure there are many of you there who might have gone through similar things and don’t deserve them, or don’t know why it has happened to them. Surely there is something going on with psychedelics and the very essence of our mind and experience here in life. Everything’s intertwined.

A journey

Disclaimer: This is the story of my experience on the 15th of July 2020 told through the use of language, memories, notes and recordings taken on that day. By no means is this text’s objective to relate it as it truly happened, for the former two (language and memory) have quite big limitations in my opinion, so I’ll focus instead on the lessons I’ve learned, things I’ve felt and expriences I’ve had. I hope this feat will help me better integrate the whole adventure and that it might be an interesting read for anybody who happens to take the time and well… read it.

I’ll try to write this as much as I can similar to a quest or tale of the things that have happened in that day. Many days have passed since the experience but as stated above, I’ve used my memory, my notes and recordings to create the richest narrative possible.

I’ll start with background information, so the story makes some sense and you get the chance to better grasp my situation. I’m male, 22 years old, a bit experienced with psychedelics (having tried LSD, Psilocybin &amp; Salvia before); the area where I took the LSD was a marked trail, also known to me as it was in the forest surrounding my hometown, where I’ve lived most of my life.

This will be a long one; I hope you’ll enjoy it. There’s a TLDR at the end.

I. Preparations: 

The adventure really starts with buying the 4 tabs, which have been advertised as 200ug each that probably were more likely around 100ug but who knows in the end? I’ve prepared them along with my backpack (where I’ve also had pasta, water, a knife,a first aid kid, a hammock and some other minor things). My parents are cool but I think having told them that I’m going to take 4 tabs of LSD alone in the forest would have scared them, so instead “I went for a dayhike with a friend”. I woke up at 8am and by 9am I was already leaving the comfortable daily life of the city behind.

II. The ascent:

I planned my trip (double meaning there) around some key elements, that would shape it: I didn’t want to scare my parents, I wanted to be alone with myself and just live this experience and last but not least, I wanted to survive it. The first challenge was getting to the designated place (which I’ve scouted before especially for this): I climbed around 200 hundred steps to a plateau, found a really nice stick, started to feel a little anxious, since it would be both my first time tripping alone in the forest and also on such a high dose (for me 400-800ug was high) but nevertheless continued. I’ve entered the forest and had to go higher, to the ridge of the hill. I followed the trails, which were known to me, encoutered a stray dog, we scared eachother a bit and went our separate ways and then thought more profoundly about an underlying fear of mine: what if something attacks me in the altered state of consciousness? Especially a wild boar, since I was too close to the city for wolves or bears but seen deers, snakes and heard about wild boars. I encouraged myself, that this is my choice and it has consequences but I need this, I want this. 

9:40 Finally I’ve reached the place and started unpacking, sharpened the stick (to feel safer), took a look at the valley below, the treeline and the other hills conturing the horizon. I put my mat on the ground and the fastened the hammock between two trees.

\*From now on I’ll start integrating notes and parts from the recordings into the text:

III. The ticket

10:00 I put the 4 tabs of LSD on and under the tongue and so, the waiting game had begun. I bought the ticket. I felt anxious about being alone in the forest on the substance’s influence and a wave of turbulent thoughts was racing through my mind: “What if someone sees me in this state?”, “What if I get attacked by somebody or something?”. I usually write thoughts during my trips and this time was no exception, so I started writing how I love my mum, my dad, my friend, a certain mentor started listing how much I love my life and how great it is. The effect was as I desired, the fear of the unknown transformed into the courage to traverse it. 

10:17 ”My headspace is already starting to feel a bit different, more agitated.”

At some point during this phase, I called my parents to tell them ”we’re” ok, trekking through the forest and that everything is fine. 

IV: The ride

10:36 ”I can already tell, it’s going to be a journey. Peace. Calm. Love.” I was writing this but the anxious thoughts could still be perceived in the corners of my mind. The tone of the experience shifted, as I put some music (Shpongle for example), sat in the hammock and looked at the sky through the tree crowns. I was feeling “just emotions”, I was starting to feel and think how emotions flow from another, how they are not constant and how there could be infinite emotions, since people and animals could feel different. “I don’t want to fight. I feel happy.”

11:17 “Everything is data.” 

11:18 “What are we? What am I? There aren’t two people who are similar.”

11:29 “What does it mean to exist? I accept it, I accept who I am. I am the world itself.” There were more thoughts but by that time it was really difficult to write, so I just added what makes sense now (I guess that’s a limitation of the retrospective process) otherwise there would be fragments like ”It’s hard, like writing in stone. I guess I am meditating. How to distinguish. Interesting.”

11:36 ”Every life is worth living.”, meaning that I’m really happy for the life I’m leading and that I’m extremely thankful to those before me, who laid the foundations of for the life I have, be it cells that divided and evolved, humans that shaped the Earth, natural phenomenons that exist and everything in-between. I exist, because they existed. There is a saying in latin: “Amor fati”, basically meaning “love for one’s life”. I’m not sure this emotion has a name but that’s what I felt.

After this last entry, some time has passed, where everytime I was closing my eyes, I was seeing fractals on a white background. Or maybe the interior of the fractals was white? Hard to tell; still, I remember a Reddit user telling me: “Enjoy the white lights!” I sure did.

V: The hallucination: 

12:26 ”I think I saw a person on the trail. Might’ve been a hallucination. I said hi, he didn’t want to show his face almost. Emotions are just flowing into eachother. What is the meaning of life? Interesting is such our own experience; who am I talking to?”

And now, in retrospective: I was sitting on the mat in the spot I chose for myself for the duration of the trip. It was around 1-2 hours in the trip (around 11-12pm as time goes) and I’ve finally got up and walked a bit around the camp (my mat, hammock and that was it pretty much), I feared going too far and forgetting where I was, so I went back and after sitting again on the mat, on the trail was a young man, kind of dirty, long-haired (hair bellow shoulders) and small frame. He walked from the left to the right on the trail and didn’t look at me; he kept his face hidden/turned from me all the time he walked. I thought that, maybe I looked dangerous and he was scared. I said “good day” and he turned his face briefly. I don’t quite remember if he replied but he continued to walk on the trail. I looked after he went, in case he would attack me or something. I was cautious and borderline scared, especially since I may have walked like a maniac a few seconds ago and he has seen me. He didn’t come back and there was something different or at least interesting about him. I couldn’t tell at that time if this person was a real person or a hallucination. And it makes me wonder, what even is “real”? It probably was a hallucination, I mean he was carrying no supplies at all (just his clothes) and his weird behaviour towards me both make me think it was a drug-induced hallucination. I never had one of those before but I’m thankful for experiencing it. If I were to interpret it, I think this young, dirty and scared man was me. At least a representation of my fear or anxiety in the current situation (and maybe not only). I was in a position of power of some sorts; I had supplies, comfort and safety from the hammock, knives and a spear for protection, food and there he was without anything. He looked afraid of me but he wasn’t aggressive. I wasn’t aggressive towards him and I meant well by saying “good day”, kind of like checking how he’ll respond. I could’ve have treated him better though, could’ve offered him some food or something. I wish I did that but I guess I’ll try to help from now on instead of feeling scared and aggressive. In my mind, he was also an image of change, of journey, of quests. He didn’t have supplies and he continued to walk on the trail. He didn’t stay. He was most probably a hallucination but the the best part is that since nobody was there with me, I have no way to ever know for sure. That makes me think again, what even is real? Was it real? Am I more real? If so, why? \*Message for him: thank you for existing!\*

VI. Change

The peak has passed after this point and I was slowly feeling like the substance has reached a plateau and slowly decreased. There was a shift in the tone or mood of the experience; after seeing the hallucination I found myself more relaxed, not scared anymore by people or animals. I was just there, enjoying nature and my part in it. My speech was still greatly distorted, thoughts were still racing but as I said, the fear/anxiety was gone. 

12:40 “Fear isn’t the opposite of joy. Avatar is a metaphor (I recently finished watching Avatar The Last Airbender at quotes from the show were coming to me, mostly from Uncle Iroh). Reality is complex. Hunger seems universal.”

13:06 “Evolution is happening right now. Future &amp; history are both happening now. Feels like ‘now’ is eternal. I wonder what we are &amp; how much (of life) is under our control.”

13:11 “How does ‘good’ feels? Anything could be good or bad, it depends on the perspective.”

13:36 “There is no balance, because everything is in constant change, evolving.”

13:43 “Everything is life. Alive. Conscious. Why should or would I be superior? I’m not. Everything is consciousness.”

At this point I stayed in that place for around 3 hours and a half and there was an internal struggle between staying in the (relative) safety of the base camp or the primal-feeling need for packing up and exploring new areas. Everything was still moving, more like flowing through water; the contrast was also high, everything was brightly coloured and untying knots wasn’t the most attractive activity at that time but the call of adventure was greater that the strength of knots; this was also reflected in my notes:

13:50 “The struggle that feels like it’s eternal: wanting to go versus wanting to stay. I guess I’ll go. To adventure. Settled life is easy. At least seems for me, in this moment.”

13:57 “I’m repacking &amp; getting to move.”

14:05 “Finally going.”

V. Man of the mountain

After packing up, I was met with two choices (probably there were more but at that moment, those 2 felt most prevalent): should I go the way I came or go deeper in the forest and make like a circle to the plateau? I chose the latter and started walking, almost throught the waves of the forest’s fabric and in my state, I was extremely surprised to observe a stag beetle trying vigorously to climb a tree. I watched it a bit, admiring its determination. It was always falling to the ground, so the next time it tried, I gently put my finger behind its back, to basically support it. Such a small action but I felt I was connected to it. Lately, I read that it was climbing the tree so strongly, because they mate in trees. It was trying to survive. I continued along the less-known trails (by me), got a bit lost, changed directions and then finally used my phone’s GPS to reorient myself. I wouldn’t have died, since I only needed to go downhill to the road but I preferred to remain in the forest. This made me think of how we aren’t technically cyborgs but most of us carry phones with us all the time and can do so much most of the time with them (like reorienting ourselves when lost in forests tripping hard on LSD). 

After a while, at around 15:00, I reached a vantage point watching over a majestic valley, as I reached the peak, there were young birch trees sitting beside me, coniferous trees almost marching below, falcons soaring through the sky, clouds morphing into infinite forms and hills dancing on the other side of the valley. I went to this place many times before but never really sat down and took in the scenery. I felt connected, like I was the scenery too. I just looked and breathed.

I’m not really sure when, but while on the peak I thought of suicide but not in an active way. More like an objective (or at least pseudo-objective) perspective of suicide. Why do people do it? Would I do it? Could I do it? Is suicide courageous or cowardly? I didn’t find the answer to all the questions, because it probably depends, since because of the situation, I could be both answers but I know I want to experience the world; I’m surely not ending it prematurely. Also, the spot wasn’t that good for suicide, since the drop was gradual. Just kidding.

It wasn’t as comfortable to write there, so I recorded myself (again, it’s great sometimes, that we have phones).

14:55 I was fascinated by a little jumping spider; I’m not sure that normally happens but in my state back then, it was like the spider was teleporting. I’m totally impressed by how varied life is. Also, I reached the conclusion that my perpective isn’t absolute. The spider wasn’t teleporting, it’s neither good nor bad and I’m not fit to judge a spider by my standards. I am a human and it is a spider; I guess that is the limit of understanding what another lifeform feels. I also thought of designing a fabric chair that uses the user’s body weight, only to reach the conclusion that that is a hammock &amp; it already exists. Bummer.

15:11 I was thinking that life is not safe, even if we live together into communities called cities. There are dangers even if you have a house, a car, a normal life. Do I want to lead a ‘normal’ life or walk on a path less trodden? In the end, the question is about the comfort zone. Could I leave it? Can I leave it?

15:12 The limitations of language were evident, as I struggled to express my thoughts; It felt like none of the words I knew could express what I was feeling. I would say now, that I was feeling content but I feel like this doesn’t do justice to the experience back then. Language comes from culture; the languages we use change the way we think. It felt like language is just a tool, one that brings both freedom and limits. 

15:32 ”Why should I be feared? I’m just another creature. I don’t want to be feared. I’m not more ’eatable’ or less ’eatable’ than other animals. We all live on this space rock together. We are one.”

VI. The descent

I stayed around on hour at the summit, almost meditating. I decided to go back to civilization, after experiencing 6 hours of LSD altered state of consciousness. I took the biggest path (even cars can go through here, sadly?) through the forest to the plateau at the start of my journey. I saw some people there but I was still kind of in-between the normal and altered state of consciousness, so living among people and acting ‘normal’ was especially hard. Do I look people in the eyes? Do I say ‘hi’? Do we wear masks? Am I talking normally? Such thoughts came to my mind but I reminded myself that life is more than those superficial rituats. The steep stairs felt like a walk in the park and after a while I was back to the ‘civilized’ world. Back to the city.

VII. Crawling back from the rabbit hole

Even though I was back, I wasn’t the same. I had this new experience, this new perspective. It may have not been much but it was something; the hallucination, the meditation on the peak; those evolved me. 

My parents asked if I wanted to go to the supermarket with them and even though I thought I cannot speak 100% correct at the moment, I thought I could blame it on the tiredness of the hike (and in a way, that was true). I just wanted to see them after the experience. I told them that “my friend went home” and agreed to go with them shopping. I told them I loved them and so, I went back. Who even went back though? Was it me? Was I somebody else? I guess I just changed a little bit.

Final thoughts:

My experience had a healthy range of emotions, varying from fear and anxiety to happiness and love. I had the patience to sit do and watch life live. I met myself as a hallucination and treated it in a humane way. I learned some things from this experience and writing this trip report surely helped me put it into perspective even more. I hope whoever reads this finds something useful in these words and lives the best life they can. Regarding the experience, would I do it again? Surely.

Everything was going right until i smoked some more weed, and then suddenly i was having a horrible panic/anxiety attack. Ive started feeling pressure in my chest, i thought i was having a bad time trying to breath (but i was breathing ok), everytime i breathed it hurted, my heart was at 1000% and i was convinced that i was dying and i would have a heart attack.

Anyways i'm still alive :D, and it has been 2 and a half months since my last MDMA. In 2 weeks i was planning to candy-flip, but i think i will just roll with a lowish dose (110/120mg + 50mg redose) because of this pannick attack. Do you think there is danger of getting an anxiety attack again or should i be ok because mdma just make you carefree?

TLDR: Ive had a anxiety/panic attack from LSD+lots of weed. I don't think it would happend without the weed (with only LSD) and it never happend without LSD (with only weed). Can MDMA trigger it again?

It maybe depends on the individual, but i would love to hear ur experiences with something similar :D

I took one yesterday at 1PM and it surprisingly worked really well. I was super productive and on the ball until like 11PM. After that I felt a little drowsy, but I decided to stay up and watch TV for a bit.

Long story short, I haven’t fucking slept. I’m not exhausted or anything, but I feel like I’ll probably lose steam in the next few hours. I still have some work to finish up, so I’m wondering if I should take a second pill?

I have no clue how tolerance works, so i don’t know if it’d even work properly. But I’m more concerned that I’ll end up being awake for another 24 hours.

Basically my options are:

A) Stay awake for now, pop an Adderall in a few hours and work until like midnight; then hope I can crash before like 5AM

or

B) Spend the next few hours trying desperately to fall asleep, then take the Adderall whenever I wake up (probably will be really late at night)

My 17th Birthday was last Friday and my not-so-admirable Brother brought edibles per my request.I had invited 5 Friends for a Party and we were just gonna watch movies - well about half an hour after I ate one Muffin I got hungry and without being able to think straight i ended up...eating 4 more Muffins.

As one would expect, i started tripping but in a very, very bad way.

Everything started moving so extremely much, i couldn't speak nor move and i felt like i was sitting in the Backseat of my own Brain. at some point, according to my friends, i stopped breathing and they basically did everything they could to keep me alive.

At some point they finally woke up my Mother who decided calling an Ambulance wasnt necessary.

Fading in and out of Conciousness i at some point had a moment on clarity, saw through my Open door and figured: hey, if i go and fucking yeet myself down the Stairs, maybe they'll call an Ambulance - why not say ""Call an Ambulance?"" because i was still high as shit and was physically incapable of talking.

So i yeeted myself down the Stairs and tried to exit the Building to get air just to get pulled back up by everyone.

Im not sure when, but when i woke up again all my friends were gone and i was Alone. i was still Extremely high and had no control over my Motor functions ...i ended up being this way for like, an additional 20 Hours, only finally stopping about \~ 4 hours ago and im still feeling extremely weird. i pissed myself several times while unconcious.

I had a Scream fight with my Mother as to why they didnt call an Ambulance and the only 2 Arguments she had were ""I dont think it was necessary"" and ""I would have been in trouble for you being high"" and i ended up Smacking her across the face and walking Barefoot outside for a few hours in the middle of the night, still pretty high.

Who knows what could have had happened? i could have stopped breathing again after everybody was gone, couldve puked and suffocated on it, could have brain damage from not breathing and falling down the stairs... but an Ambulance isn't necessary?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR i ate 5 Pot Muffins and got so high i was unable to Talk, Move, faded in and out of Conciousness, threw myself down the Stairs to get outside for Air and Nobody called the Ambulance because they didn't want to get in Trouble for me being so fucking High. slapping Mother because she wouldnt acknowledge her blatant mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

Im certainly never doing weed again.

I drank last night and today, I was on the brink of a terrible hangover. Luckily, it was very mild, but being on the brink of a hangover (pain) was kind of a driving force to seek pleasure.

Lying on bed, I was vaping and watching porn. I had had breakfast and it was in the afternoon by then.

Vaping somehow helped with the headache. I was of course dehydrated so I also kept drinking water.

Then, I realized I got cigarettes. Cigarettes makes hangovers worse but the thought that I had cigarettes in a way lighted up my brain. So, I went and smoke. Bad. The thought that I had cigs was more pleasurable than smoking itself.

Then I realized I had ramen. Soupy. It's definitely good for hangovers. The thought of that immediately gave me pleasure. I haven't eaten it.

I went downstairs and checked the dinner table. Some sort of crushed corn dish was there. Tried it. Immediately alleviated the headache. So, now I knew it helped with the headache just like vaping.

So, I went back upstairs and continued browsing on my phone aimlessly. Then the thought of eating that corn came in - immediate pleasure. The thought of grabbing the vape pen and vaping - immediate pleasure.

The pleasure lasted for like 5 or 10 seconds but I've been triggering it again and again with the thoughts.

The pleasure happens when the thought of those activities comes by itself. I can't of course keep repeating in my mind ""I got vape. I got corn"".

Anyone else have a similar experience?

Im a massive speed freak and love hunting, made sense to get on it. The night before I went out I had a bit, not too much, just enough for a buzz and then I could get some sleep. Turns out it was far stronger piss than I thought, 3am came round and I was still kinda high so I just kept going. By 7am I smashed a gram and half, and was really fucked. Ended up on my knees with a speaker doing some weird noding dance like Maynard Keenan. I decided to lay off it for I while and smoke some pot to calm me down.

By 12pm, I thought fuck it and smashed the rest of the of the gear. Stupid fucking idea. As I walked along the river I could hear people calling out to me, Could see shadowy figures running through the pines. My head was fucked and I was freaking out. 

I ended up in a boar wallow. The pines are so thick that no light gets in, the mud was up to my ankles. Pigs in australia are big and fucking angry if youre in their wallow. As I pushed through,I could hear them squeal at me as if theyre screaming, still seeing the evil figures. I have never been so scared in my life. I made it out of the valley and had to sit for a hour and process what was happening. I got back onto the river and saw a man with binoculars looking at me, so I approched him. I didnt take my eyes off him until I was about 40m away, I look at the ground once and hes vanished. 

By the time I stumbled on to the pack of feral goats I was looking for, it was about 3pm.. I think. I was weak, I hadnt eaten or slept, running on a bottle of Jameson and winfield red cigarettes. I could barely draw back my bow. Took the shot. It was freaking out on the ground while its lungs filled and I swear to god it was abusing me like it was in the exorsist. Saying the most disgusting things. I could barely even look at but I eventualy skinned it and quartered it, then started the mind fucking 2 hours back to the cabin.

I just Saw a post from a dude finding drugs to do for his bucket list and someone mentioned 2-CB.. Thought back to the day when took 2-CB the first time and to that one other day i tried it and decided to never do it again.

I already did a lot of different drugs. Don't get me wrong, I don't think misusing substances and medications is something to brag about, neither does it make me gain the ability to judge a substance or it's users just because i didn't like that substance. If someones having a good time with something, nice for them. 

That said, i was pretty baffled from 2-CB because i never got so disappointed by a substance itself. I didn't got any horrortrip or something, i just expected way more from it. Maybe my fault ;)

I just kind of don't like the ""vibe"" it gives me. It feels so weird. After half an hour, orally taken, i began to notice first effects. It felt a bit like a colder mdma or soft lsd come up. The body effect got more intense over the first hour, peaking at about 1.5 - 2 hrs after ingesting. And boy, i was never feeling more internally unrest in my whole life i felt like i had to burst.

That feeling was so unpleasant for me that i couldn't really get into enjoying the hallucinations, for which i took them. Gotta say, the optics were nice. Not more, not less. They don't leave you unspeaking from the beauty like dmt or morph like acid.

I see it as the retarded son from LSD &amp; MDMA, he's got a bit more from the mother's side, loving molly, as there are clearly amphetamine-like body effects, just stronger on the body, brain felt less stimulated than it does from classic amphetamines.
The ""lsd-ish"" side of it is way less powerful than the father, it doesn't give you the feeling that someone took your brain out, then drove it to Oktoberfestdisneywonderland just to drug-rape it in a shady alley after taking it to McDonald's, the one that lsd gives me sometimes. Much more structured in thinking and things are still pretty logical to analyze than on lsd. Also the things you see are more logically ordered, also feels colder and there was zero spirituality.

It was a neutral experience because it didn't do what i expected (proof that i still don't know shit about drugs: before taking a new drug never expect anything from it, but expect everything from it. if you get what i mean) but we still had a nice time and were in a pretty good mood overall. The thing that killed it for me was the body load. I swear if i get so nervous again i'll probably just skin myself to get out of me. The fucking worse.
Could the intense body-load have something to do with my adhd? The friend i took it with also has adhd just not the same type as me but he didn't get those extreme symptoms that almost made me pull out with a xan. 

Like some hippies tried to make a ""one pill candyflip"" (IMAGINE THAT) but got a bit too distracted by those cool glowing worms in the whole process so they mixed it randomly together, tossed some mdma in it, then some acid, then wich one again? Acid? Fuck it, better add both again. Oh and we need to add meth. I really like my psychedelics together with the body effects of a slight, yet strong enough overdose to make you ask people on reddit if you gonna die or not. 

How do you feel about this drug? 

Would you put it more to the family of psychedelics or stimulants?

The first time, I ever did it, It was Halloween 2014, I was a sophomore and a dude in my classroom offered some ""acid"". I bought the blotters from him, but before trying them, I googled how LSD should feel like, and obviously, that it shouldn't taste bitter. Anyway I still took it, alone in my room. For me, 25i is disturbing and awesome at the same time. ) ) )

I bought the blotters from a dude. Me and a friend decided to split one in half an take one each. This was probably 2nd period. So I took out my scissors and cut it in half. We took it and waited for about 30 to 40 minutes. I slowly started to feel it when the bell rang and we went out to recess. I don't remember much of the start of the trip, as the weird things happened later. 

We returned from recess to a class called ""Logic Thinking"" or something like that. We had to work in pairs so I joined with a kid who sat next to me. By this time, my vision has started to warp with colours and my face feels kind of weird. For my luck, I couldn't even write a word properly, my handwriting looked all shaky. That was because my vision was distorted, and so my writing as a result of that.

The teacher approached me and called me out for not doing anything during the 90 minutes of class. For about 3/4 of the time I had been lying on my chest on the desk with the most obvious psychedelic trip face. I told the teacher I had a stomach ache, and proceeded to make a soft grunting sound, pretending to feel pain. Fuck I bet she knew I was on something haha.

Then my friend who was also tripping, pushed his way while sitting on his desk making the loudest screeching noise ever with it. Just to whisper to my ear ""dude, I have seen mickey mouse"". 

We went out to recess, then returned to History class. The teacher hadn't arrived yet, so we hung out the door. Then, the inspector called us out for not being in class and when she was centimeters close to the door, my friend shuts the door as loud as possible and locks it, leaving the bitch outside lol.

What happened next was nothing worth of telling, it was pretty boring as we were starting to come down.

I’m starting law school in a couple weeks and I’ve got a bunch of study drugs saved up from various sources/friends. It’s a mixture of Adderall, Vyvanse, and Ritalin (each 20mg). I’m planning on taking 1 or 2 pills every week until finals season (ensuring a 2 day break between each pill at minimum), when I plan on upping my dosage, and I want to do this in a safe way where I won’t build up any tolerance or suffer any horrible withdrawal effects etc. Do you guys think this is realistic? Is it okay to be cycling thru addy/vyvanse/ritalin or should I stick to only 1 of the types? Any other general advice?

**Background**
So this is kinda a question that requires info on my recent health and substance use. I’m hoping it’s not an annoyance but hopefully my anxiety comes down after reading some replies and doing additional research.

This is very relevant, but my health insurance was cut about 3 weeks ago.

I was RX’d 2-6mg of Xanax a day. I had zero warning I was losing my insurance and couldn’t afford the medication at the time using cash. So I do the best taper I could with what little I had.

Well on day 3 at work I had a seizure and banged my skull off the concrete floor. This resulted in a brain hemorrhage/internal brain bleeding. I woke up in the ICU hours later with tons of IVs. 

All they did was feed me Kepra and 16mg of Dilaudid via IV every 4 hours and 60mg of Oxycodone IR orally every 6 hours. But only after calling them stupid for giving me pain killers containing acetaminophen that thins blood....when I have a brain bleed. 

I finally AMA’d after 3 days and agreed to not touch Xanax. Since I might be in the clear.

Upon leaving I can tell I wasn’t in the clear.  I felt off and my night terrors were worse than ever. I visited a psych who took cash and would do a taper and was successful at getting 0.5mg for tapering and a handful of 2mg bars for emergency panic attacks.

**Dosing/Substance &amp; Details**
9:30AM:  ~5G Kratom. (10-12) 00 Caps

9:35AM: 70-80mg CBD Gummies
&amp; 500mg Phenibut HCL

9:45AM: 2mg Alprazolam (RX’d)

[Vaped] 0.4g 93% Live Resin Extract 

**Now at work**

10:00AM: I feel fine, in fact best I’ve felt in weeks and my Xanax taper is working. But dammit I forgot my portable nectar collector at home. Luckily my “buddy” shows up soon after with his to let me borrow.

Guy let’s me borrow his portable wax rig, his YoCan and he said it was an older coil and some shatter was in there. What he DIDNT tell me was there was also a good amount of methamphetamine residue in the coil. And I ripped this thing.

On exhale I realize something isn’t right. I’m sweating bad and my heart is racing. I’m worrying if a seizure is possible which could very well kill me, especially if I didn’t take the alprazolam. 

I begin to have a panic attack. And I’m tapering with 0.5mg Xanax and have plenty. But I also have a few bars for panic attacks and PTSD night terrors. Also my tolerance is relatively high.

Noon-ish: ~5G Kratom. (10-12) 00 Caps
Taken in an effort to once again calm me down without Xanax.

This Xanax isn’t working well after an hour and I need to conserve for this taper because I want off. I call my friend bitching and he seems to feel awful and since he abuses Xanax like I used to I could see him forgetting. I tell him I need something to slow my heart rate and blood pressure. Only thing he has is 50mg of methadone. 

1:30PM: 50mg Methadone Syrup w/1mg of Xanax an hour later to monitor my respiratory effects.

I take it [the methadone] I was on a much higher dose during addiction years ago and knew it wouldn’t get me high really. So I took it with a CBD shot that has some vitamins.


Should I be worried? What can I do to mitigate some of the negative effects or at least prevent seizures? I mean benzos are anticonvulsants and the cause of my previous ones so it would help but again, conserving to taper properly. Would gabapentin help? Also I plan to only use phenibut 3x a week max. Never back to back. 


Sorry for the annoying post I usually don’t make them, but my life has turned around a lot and I’m taking steps to make it better so I don’t want to die or end up seriously hurt.

Above all, if it seems too risky, I'll avoid it and just not go.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be going on a pretty long, hike tomorrow, about 7 miles each way (7-11 hours in total) without much elevation change (although it is 3000 feet higher up than I'm used to) and cool temperatures. 

I plan on taking MDMA about 4 hours in after making sure that I'm holding up pretty well. I don't have a scale, but I know I have 3.5 grams and have tested it with a reagent kit, so I'm just going to shoot for 50mg, and if I go over, the amount still won't be too risky because the MDMA is pure and not mixed with anything.

I plan on taking about 2 grams of mushrooms an hour after that.

I may also take some ibuprofen if I get aches.

I am totally OK with going back early if I feel like I'm getting too tired. I am skeptical of my ability to gauge this with MDMA, but in my past experiences with MDMA I remember being pretty lucid, and not getting too carried away with optimism.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I am nervous about this. It seems risky but also potentially amazing. It is the longest hike I've been on, but I've been on more difficult hikes that were also pretty long. I feel like the MDMA would be a helpful motivator as long as I time it right, and I have some backup adderall if I come down too early and feel exhausted.

I am 22, and I feel like even if I do get too optimistic with the MDMA, 14 miles isn't absurdly long for someone in decent shape. But, maybe this is a horrible idea??

I'd recommend you please try snus or nicotine pouches. They're cheap, discreet, and remove the respiratory tract from the entire equation. One of the things I noticed getting off vaping is that there isnt the same ""compulsive dosing"" that there is with vaping. It's easier to just use it when you need it. (for vaping, I would vape whenever, whereever like 24/7). Also, I don't know this for sure but the slower absorption of nicotine via sublingual routes is probably safer than spiking nicotine levels with vaping and smoking. 

If you vape- scared of all tobacco? that's fine. The nicotine pouches are almost all the same as vaporized nicotine. Nicotine salts with high bioavailability, faster/stronger and lasts shorter than freebase.

If you smoke- you can try nicotine pouches, but snus will have all the MAOIs that cigarettes have making the transition a lot easier with the tobacco satisfaction. 

**swedish snus and nicotine pouches are objectively safer than cigarettes, there has never been a single case of mouth, throat, or any kind of cancer from either**

Last month I started dating a guy in our group that I've been madly in love with for half a year, but once we started dating it wasn't how I imagined it would be at all and for the past week we barely talked and I've been losing my feelings for him. But I know he adores me, I just don't feel the same. 

I've considered breaking up with him for a couple weeks now because I don't want to lead him on when I know my heart isn't it in. It isn't fair to him.

The drugs made me confident enough to confess to my two closest guy friends how I was feeling and they fully supported me and held me in their arms and comforted me for an hour while I cried and poured out all my repressed feelings. 

So they just left and I messaged the guy I was dating with my honest feelings basically breaking up with him. He hasn't read it yet, and now I'm just having a horrible time because of the drugs.

When I was 20, I got raped after getting black out drunk at my friend's house one night. I don't remember anything, so I was constantly at war with myself. I felt guilty for even being affected by it and responsible for it, too. Those thoughts became way too much for me so I decided to try everything I could to numb the feelings. I tried as many drugs as I could: acid, molly, ecstasy, coke, adderall, I even did meth once on accident because I was told it was ecstasy. This was all in a 3-4 month period. I started to drink heavily. Every time I would try to drink casually with my friends it always turned into me blacking out or being so drunk that it wasn't even fun. 

No drugs could make me forget my feelings and alcohol only numbed them for so long until it would all just come crashing into me again. It was a cycle I desperately wanted to stop but I didn't know how.

I felt like I was drowning and the will to keep myself afloat was dwindling at a rapid rate.

About a week ago, I decided to try shrooms. I had done a lot of research on it before, reading about the  health benefits. Unlike all of the other substances I was abusing, I knew that taking shrooms couldn't be based off of that. I knew it had to be something I wanted to actually help me rather than numb me.

I knew 100% I wanted to take the shrooms by myself for the first time so I could experience it in the most introspective way I could. I only bought two grams because l was a little nervous about it considering I was going to be alone.

After they started to kick in, the visuals were blowing my mind. Everything just seemed 3D if that makes sense, and everything looked disproportionate. I got the giggles which was fun, but at the peak of my trip, I thought about the intention I had set beforehand: I wanted to come to terms with my sexual assault. 

I ended up crying for what seemed like hours but was probably only five minutes. It wasn't necessarily sad crying, though, it was just me letting out everything I had been suppressing and holding in ever since it happened.

After I went to sleep that night and woke up the next day, I felt very strange. I think it was because I had addressed my trauma; finally let it go. I didn't know what to do with that.

After a few days, I felt normal again. But it was a new normal for me. I wasn't carrying the weight of guilt with me constantly and I just felt so much better.

Last night, I decided to try shrooms with my closest friends. I expected the experience to be similar to the first time, but boy was I wrong. But in the best way possible.

These shrooms were a lot stronger than the other ones and I took between three and four grams. The come up was a bit uncomfortable for me because I just felt very out of place. But me and my friends went outside to stare at the sky and the visuals were amazing. I felt very at peace and that everything that was happening, where I was, what I was doing, who I was with, was meant to happen.

The peak was insane, though. It was almost overwhelming at times. But me and my one friend were laying on the kitchen floor talking about the most random shit and laughing our asses off. Everything just felt like it's own, if that makes sense. Like, walking into different rooms felt like walking into a different world, I guess. All of us started talking to each other and every single word that each of us were saying seemed so meaningful and it just felt really good to communicate. We went for a walk and laughed so much, it was just amazing. 

The comedown was just as good as the peak, my friends and I were just talking about anything and everything. I don't even know how to describe the way it felt to talk to them, it was just so easy and everyone was showing their true colors with no hesitation.

Today, after having slept, I feel at peace; even more so than when I took them by myself. Everything just feels so right at the moment and I don't even feel the need to take drugs anymore or drink alcohol. 

I don't want to be that person who says a drug changed their life, but I think I am that person lol. 

I just really wanted to explain this on here because it amazes me how much this affected me in a positive way. I keep saying that it's like my life is now split; before and after. I never want to go back to before ever again and I don't think I will.

I hope that everyone gets the chance to try them because it really is a miracle drug. I hope I don't sound totally crazy to all of you, but I'm at peace with myself now, so that's really all that matters.

I haven't had good experiences when it comes to consuming substances (i.e. I have never had edibles that work on me), and that was the case with this trip too.

I took 4g dried of GTs (*image included at the bottom*); I ground them up (I was told by the guy I purchased from, as well as the guy that grew them, that this was a mistake?) and mixed into an orange juice; I made sure to eat all the mush at the bottom too. About an hour in and I feel nothing, just some uneasiness in my stomach. 3 hours later, still nothing so I rolled and smoked a joint, and at the 4-hour mark, I think I saw slight distortions. I had a 5 min period where I thought it was working, where I had a locked feeling with sensations like I was spacing out (eyes), and saw some very very slight geometry on my blank wall. This was the extent of what I experienced that trip, unfortunately (The two people mentioned above said they had never heard of someone having such an experience). Although I was happy at the end of my experience, I was left feeling shorted and wanting more.

I am not sure what is going on with me - I made sure to fast from the night before (only ate some blueberries to avoid hunger pains) so almost a full 18 hours and took them in a good environment, in the safety of my home while everyone else was at work or school (was back home for spring break). **Could it have been something mental?** I feel as though I was very relaxed, in a good environment with good music and comfortable clothes, in my favorite type of weather.

**Did I do anything wrong on my first trip? Has anyone else had such an experience, or know why I did? Are some people immune to the effects of psilocybe cubensis?** I don't know if some people need to smoke pot first, but that seemed to help - I am not sure if that takes away from or adds to experience, however, so I am hesitant to mix and not give mushrooms the respect they deserve.

**I would appreciate any and all help + advice to a beginner tripper here, looking for some answers and to learn/enjoy as much as I can in this lifetime.**

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think the higher power might have been guiding me to take it slow and be patient, so I have waited till now to try mushrooms again. I plan on taking 4 grams PE straight (I am buying 7g of shake + stems total, 4 for the first trip and for another time maybe 2 weeks after this first trip; I don't get access to shrooms often), no blending this time, likely with some orange juice. I plan on taking them at night while nobody is awake to bother me, and I'll be in the comfort of my room, with good lighting and will try darkness as well. I am searching for an enlightening experience, to open my mind's eye. LMK if you are interested in an update/trip post when I take that trip!

A as a few days ago I took 4x 30mg Codeine Phosphate pills with about 240mg Codeine Phosphate as a syrup (no APAP) mixed with about 75mg Promethazine in one night. I felt some relatively light effects later in the night after taking the last of the pills. I also felt the side effects of being hot and itchy and at one point feeling as if I was going to throw up. Despite this I had an overall enjoyable experience. 

However today I took 6x 30mg Codeine pills at once and felt little to no effects. I thought this would have some sort of profound effect as I have seen that a good dosage is between 150mg and 200mg. Does the method of ingestion have that large an influence or something? I have no built up tolerance either as this was only my second time trying it. 

Any help or advice on why this happened and what to try in the future would be much appreciated as I don’t want to waste the rest of my codeine.

So another buddy found a guy who's selling ""300ug"" gel tabs. From what I've gathered, it's highly unlikely that's the accurate dose, but say it is, would that be too much for me?

I took my 2mg clonazepam (prescribed) at around 3 ish, and at around 6 I decided to take 2 servings (so far) of about 1.5 tbsp of micronized(instant) kava. 

They have a decent synergy! I’m getting tingles down my spine, I feel mood elevation(klonopin seems to make my mood a little lower, I will probably switch back to diazepam my next psych appt.)
My body is nice and relaxed and nothing seems to bother me. I’m not getting any negative effects at all, but will be cooking a nice meal shortly, which is said to make the kava hit a little stronger. 

If anyone is thinking of this combo, I say go for it, it’s very nice for both body and mind. I also have tried this with about 25mg if Valium and got the same effects + more muscle relaxation. 

A little unrelated, but I have some etizolam (consort etizest - 1)and soma on the way right now and am wondering what to expect in terms of feeling for those two drugs (not taken together). I also heard that etiz doesn’t gain a tolerance as rapidly as other traditional benzos, so if anyone could weigh in on that, I’d really appreciate it! 

My tolerance to benzos is pretty small, the most I’ve taken in one day is 25mg Valium and 1mg kkonopin amd was feeling soooooo nice. 

Also if anyone could give me any info on diclazepam, that would be appreciated! I’m hesitant to pull the trigger because people say it’s only good for tapering,. Which I’m not,. I just really like Valium.

We were all in 7th grade. His parents were having a lot of people over for a party. I knew my one friend was adventurous when it came to drugs but i didn’t really know anything about them at the time (or did any). 

I get to his house and after greeting his parents we head to his room to chill out for a bit before everyone arrived to the party. He goes into his closet then re emerges with 2 white pills. He claims their Xanax and says he’s going to take them. He then asks if I want one and I refuse. We’re good friends so he didn’t pressure me. Instead he took both.

Everything is fine we’re just vibing and he’s in a great mood. Are other friend arrives so we all head to the backyard to chill and listen to music. In the backyard his parents had bought a keg for the party. His dad comes out about 5 mins later and says we can all have on cup of beer if we want. Like I said earlier I didn’t do anything back then so I refused and just hung out with my friends. My other two friends however (doing rebellious kid things) did not just have “one cup of beer” they had many cups. Big styrofoam cups. So many cups I lost count. They were both on they’re ass stumbling everywhere, while I just sat back, watched, and laughed with them.

In the moment this was just 3 of us having a great time however looking back on this makes my stomach churn. My best friend could have died. He was not a big kid. Maybe 100 pounds. He didn’t know what he was doing. He was 12. I didn’t know what he was doing. His parents did not know what he was doing. To this day I have no idea how that night didn’t end badly. 

People please if you are young and going to use drugs please educate yourself. If you know somebody in your life who is young, please, educate them. Nobody should die from these things.

I've been enjoying my spliffs for the last five years but now have come to the realization that I do not ever want to smoke tobacco again. I've always mixed my joints with them but I do not want to use it any more. I have started to look into herbal alternatives but I can not find a conclusive answer to the most burning (pun intended) question I have regarding the substitutes:

Is there any point? 

I know tobacco is terrible for you but the basic process of combustion and inhaling all the messy parts that come with that stays the same. But then again: the link between tobacco and various types of cancer is crystal clear while the link between cannabis smoking and cancer remains unresolved. 

So, what about these herbal alternatives? I have searched for studies but as usual they are few and far between and it's hard to find any definitive evidence of anything. For those wondering, I do not want to smoke my joints 100% full of weed because I find them unsmokable due to the amount of itchiness in my throat. 

If anybody has any 2 cents to add, please do so. Any insight is welcomed! Please do also not refrain from posting links to sources if you feel it could add additional information.

All the time, every day. I would get rape flashbacks that made me helpless, powerless. Like a loser, an idiot. Just completely ashamed of myself and disgusting. 

Meth COMPLETELY erased that. I was super fucking confident. It made my flashbacks completely go away.

But it was getting to a dangerous point. I was spending hundreds of dollars of meth that I couldn't afford, and I ended up having sex to get meth.

I quit. I had a couple friends stay with me for a couple weeks and keep me happy and distracted. I had support and I was able to stop. That was in like December.

Now, I'm getting intense flashbacks again. I relapsed on a couple bad ones a few times earlier in the year. But now, I've done meth 3 times in the past week.


I'm scared. I don't know how to describe what I'm feeling besides saying I'm scared. I'm struggling.

My friends have been difficult to contact lately, most are really busy. One of them said they'd talk to me yesterday but they never called. So I'm assuming they want nothing to do with me anymore.

I need meth to remove the flashbacks otherwise I'll be in a constant state of flashbacks and be unable to do work for college. 

But I'm worried. I've been doing hw for a couple hours but all I can think about is how fucking terrible I feel and how much better I'd feel on meth.

I'm doing the best I can to avoid meth. I was planning on it yesterday but I forced myself to avoid it. But I don't know how much longer I can do this.

Basically, heres the situation :

Fell off a roof a week ago and I got a full reconstruction of my right foot. I've already had most of the surgeries I needed, and I now have metal plates and screws inserted throughout my foot to hold it together. I also have stitches that need to be removed within the next 2 weeks, as they are basicallt staples over my foot. I've been ordered off work for 2 months, and can currently not put any weight on it what so ever. I'm confined to a couch/can't stand for more than 10 minutes without being in so much pain I tear up.

I'm also on morphine, very strong stuff. They have me taking ""celecoxib"" too which is just for inflammation and some minor pain.

My question : Is it safe for me to take a normal dose (120mg) of molly 3 weeks from now? My doctors said I should be able to stand on my own/with the help of a metal boot and my crutches, but I also have a wheelchair in case the next surgeries go wrong. So the question is more related to the fact that i'm currently taking very strong ""painkiller"" type medication, will it interfere too much with the molly?

Story: So I met up with 2 of my friends yesterday to smoke some pot. Both of them are heavy smokers compared to me. They took 3 bong hits each, when I got to my first one, since I was cooking. Everything was fine to them, they were super fucking stoned, but nothing seemed wrong. Then I hit it. We thought of going out for some snacks, but instantly after hitting it I understood that I ain't gonna walk anywhere and not 30 seconds pass I faint and have huge hallucinations. These were psychedelic hallucinations, strongest I have ever experienced, never have I had something even remotely similar happen to me on shrooms or lsd.

So I was stuck in eternal rabbit hole, was thinking about basic stuff, meaning of life, who the fuck I am and why do I exist etc. etc. The experience was actual loop - I had one vision of one of my friends checking me and then all I saw was eyeball like void, I was the center of universe and I was circling around myself (like doing eternal backflips). I switched back and forth between these two visions, but they didn't change, even though the dude was checking on me for the whole time I was on the floor (like 15 minutes in total). The thought process was fucking painful, when I had visions of my friend trying to help, it literally seemed like biggest pain imaginable, all I wanted is to be left alone but I couldn't tell him. At some points I had sense of reality, but couldn't move or say something. When it got the eyeball it seemed better, but once it's back at my friend checking me - I wanted to not exist. I witnessed it all in flashes (like 12 per second I guess) and every flash I heard a word screamed in my head. It was anime like voice (even though I have never watched anime). The whole thing seemed like videogame. It was eternal, I didn't have a clue how long was I on the floor, could have been years - time didn't exist, I has no recollection of previous loop, only what I was seeing at that exact moment. (Turned out it was 15 minutes).

My friends told me that I wasn't just laying on the floor and dreaming. They told me I was moving my arms and head like people during Parkinson's seizure do.

I don't think weed was laced. My friends are frequent smokers compared to me, but they don't do any other drugs, so that's why I am here - do you think I just took too much, or could there be something I should talk to doctor about. I donated blood 12 hours before, so I would like to think that the combinations of the two things did this to me, but would like to hear if someone else has encountered weed seizures.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,696691,public,confidence,self,DMT like experience from weed,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hxss3a/dmt_like_experience_from_weed/,no_ads,0.0,1595734696.0,,Cannabis,,Cannabinoids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Question for you guys. I have been researching this a lot and keep getting very mixed information. 

I took a 100mg morphine ER pill orally today at noon. (I have a relatively high opiate tolerance and this dose gets me feeling nice and happy all day long.) 

Since this is ER, the effects of the morphine will last me well into the night/early next morning. 

I would like to dose 100mg MDMA with a friend later this evening, around 9-10pm, so I will still be under the full effects of the morphine.

Will the increased dopamine effects of the morphine complement the serotonin release from the MDMA, or will the morphine hinder and lessen the MDMA experience? 

I have found mixed experiences from erowid and other various forums. Some say it’s heavenly, some say it’s a waste. Also, I know the health risks of speedballing opiates and stimulates, and that’s not what I’m here for.

Cannabis often gives me bad anxiety or panic attacks. I was once a very enthusiastic daily smoker, but I have basically had to quit due to ""The Fear"". I've gone through long phases of not smoking, sometimes for years, and some OK periods of smoking again, only to have the fear rear it's ugly head and have me quitting again. I was smoking a lot at the beginning of lock down, but have been off it for about 10 weeks. 

Recently my wife has wanted to try mushrooms for her first time. I have had them before, maybe 5 times, about 15 years ago. I only had good times on them then, but I'm nervous to try them again because of the way my weed experience has changed since then.  I'm afraid that anxiety will lead straight to a bad time.

I do feel like it can be useful information however, both in answering the question I have, and maybe even for some newbies.   
But, if you feel like you don't want to read all of it, I have tried to label each section so that you can skip to whatever section you want. Or you can skip to the end if you want the \[TL:DR\]. But, this has taken almost 3 hours to write so I would appreciate it if you read it all. *IF you have the time of course. THANKS :)*  


**About Me, School and my Struggles:**  
I , \[18M\] am currently in Grade 12. I suffer from anxiety (which for me also leads to *a lot* of overthinking) , more recently depression, OCD and mild tourrettes/uncontrollable twitches. I have been to multiple doctors, psychiatrists and educational psychologists who had originally believed I had ADHD but later decided that that was not true, or at least were not able to 'tag' me with it. Basically, I'm not what you would consider a ""normal"" student.  


**Context:**  
I am therefore not a very academically inclined person and struggle with working at school and specifically staying concentrated and sitting/keeping still for long periods of time. Growing up, in school I would always be told to ""sit still"" or ""stop fidgeting"" or to ""stop doing that you're distracting the others"" but for me it was near impossible to keep still. I would always be moving *some* part of my body. Eventually I managed to control it to the point where I could - at least for short periods of time - sit seemingly still, while in reality actually moving my toes in my shoes and swaying on my chair or rubbing a stone in my pocket while shaking my leg.   
This obviously also had a negative effect on my marks in school because I couldn't work well, and it made exams a hell of a lot more difficult (as I would have to sit still and work for 2-3 hours straight). Like I said, I went to an educational psychologist to try and sort some of this out, and see what could be done. I now have a concession which allows me to type my exams instead of writing them by hand, (because my handwriting is terrible and illegible) which interestingly helps me with my fidgeting because I can tap a lot of keys all the time. It still however does not fix the problem completely as I still struggle to sit still and in the same place for such a long period of time without moving.   
My OCD is also a very annoying attribute. It basically forces me to make sure that everything is always perfect, balanced, symmetrical and/or even. Most of the time this just an inconvenience and makes me waste time on stupid shit. Like, for example, if I walk past a door and my shirt gets caught on the handle and is stretched, I will have to stretch the other side of my shirt until I feel that it has been equally stretched to the other side. Or if I bite the one side of my tongue by mistake, I have to bite the other with the same amount of force. Otherwise I cannot stop thinking about it and will not be able to focus on anything else. Really annoying.  
I more recently, (from grade 10) started to find school daunting and felt overwhelmed with work and what was expected of me. I was so often not able to finish work on time, or at all,  which led to my marks dropping significantly.  This, - along with breaking up with my girlfriend of almost 2 years - started a phase of depression to add onto my existing problems. 

**Parents &amp; Law:**  
Luckily, I have quite liberal parents who were fairly open to letting me try drinking and smoking weed. (at least after I was 16) But, there main concerns, as is for most parents was that it would affect school and my marks.   
After one of my first times smoking weed I asked my dad what he thought of cannabis. It was on that day that I realized my dad was the biggest stoner I knew. He praised the stuff and had been using it for over 25 years. This was obviously good news for me because now I knew that I didn't have to be as secretive and try hide it like like most of my friends did.   
The law around cannabis in my country is somewhat complicated, and I wont go into it. If you want, you can research the legality of cannabis in South Africa in your own time. But to sum it up for you quickly, IT IS legal to posses, cultivate, and consume cannabis in South Africa for anyone over the age of 18 on private property.   
This was good news for me, but didn't really make it easier for me because I still wasn't 18. My parents therefore had made a rule that they would not allow me to smoke weed until I was 18.  


**Now we get to the drugs. (I will label each one for convenience)**  
*One thing I need to mention is that until recently I didn't want to try any synthetic/man made drugs. I would only try natural/organic drugs. eg. weed, shrooms and was open to San Pedro at some point etc. (although I realize this isn't really accurate because I was vaping and drinking) But I meant for harder drugs...*

**Nicotine:**  
Around the age of 15, I had my first cigarette. A casual experience at a friends party, I was not amazed and didn't really feel the urge to try it again after that. (especially because I was aware of how much they fuck up your lungs) .  
Very close to that time I also tried my first vape. Now this was something I liked. To be completely transparent, most of the interest was the fact that I could blow fat clouds and it tasted nice. As well as the fact that after a while I got a little buzz. (this first experience was with an E-leaf Ijust S and some 3-6 nic juice)  
A week or two later, I bought myself my first vape, which was also an Ijust S. 

**Cannabis**  
Skipping to my 16th year, I had my first experience with weed. It was at a sleepover with some friends, and someone (who would funnily enough become my girlfriend for the next 2 years) had organized to get an edible brownie for 4 of us. I was trying to be cool in front of the girls (as 16 Y/O boys do) and said that I had smoked before and that I was chilled. I ate the brownie and as it kicked in, I fell in love. This was **nice**. I felt my body relax completely for the first time, and I was so happy, laughing at everything and just didn't want it to end really.  So I knew I had found a game changer...  
Over the next couple of years, my bond with cannabis grew much closer and as I did more research and had more experience, I realized how much it could help me with my difficulties.   
Cannabis was basically fulfilling my every need and helping me with so much. It relaxed my body and almost stopped my twitches, it calmed me down so that I didn't overthink every single thing and gave my mind time to relax. It obviously made me happier too and often made my day a lot better when school and work had made it so shit. All of this with minimal repercussions and few side effects.. A perfect match???

**Alcohol:**  
Alcohol never really caught on for me, I had my first drunk experience at a music festival around the age of 16 too. I had bought a 750ml of Smirnoff vodka for me and 3 other friends. We started drinking and made it to the festival. It was an under 18s music festival so no alcohol or cigs were allowed. Basically, after all of us had enough to feel quite drunk there was still a quarter of the bottle left. I decided to chug the rest of it because I didn't want to throw it away and waste it. (seeing as I bought it)  
What a bad decision. I barely remember that night, and it was actually pretty embarrassing and stupid. I even vomited out the window of my friends dads car when he was lifting us back. The next morning I had my first hangover. Wow. Luckily my dad helped me and was laughing at the story. But I was vomiting up everything I had inside me. And I said the classic ""I'm never drinking again.""  
There were obviously times after that where I got drunk, (especially because my friend group drinks whenever we got together on weekends) but I really didn't enjoy it that much. Especially because I was a stoner at heart, and every time I was sick from drinking, I would say ""why would I do this when I can just smoke weed and feel great"". 

**Mushrooms:**  
I was 17 when I had my first Mushroom trip. Before I tried them I was quite nervous, I had never done any drug as strong as this and I had only seen videos or heard stories about how 'intense' it was, especially compared to what I had done. I was also worried about my ticks acting up and maybe having like a spaz attack or not being able to control my body properly. But, I was keen to try them and there wasn't really going to be a better time. I was in my room with my good friend who had experience with psychedelics and more drugs than me, had made a nice plate of food and felt comfortable and content. I had 2 grams of dried Amazonians, and it went well. It was an amazing experience and it opened my mind to so much more than I had previously believed. As well as showing me a whole new world of vision altering drugs. I really enjoyed it once I had gotten over the anxiety that i'm sure most people have on their first trip. The way I described it the next day was and is still a perfect way in my mind. ""It was like what you think the best and strongest strain of weed in the world would feel like."" I think this was also partly because of how people talk about weed and their experiences. saying stuff like ""yooh broo, I swear I saw a face in that wood last night broo"" or ""damnnn I just passed out and saw cool colours for like an hour"".   
But all in all it was a good experience and I have taken mushrooms about 4 times since.   


**LSD**  
My first experience with acid was actually a week ago. Like I said before, I was adverse to trying it because I only wanted to do organic/natural drugs. But, as I have grown older and learnt more about drugs and their effects, I have become more open to trying almost anything. (as long as it is not super addictive or extremely unhealthy). It was my decision to try it, and so I got my fellow psychonaut friend to trip-sit me and help me get the acid. I originally wanted to take 100-150ug because I know im  a bit of a lightweight with new substances and I had bit of that same anxiety I had with my first shroom trip. However, my friend told me that 200ug is the 'average' dose and I the tabs that we had were 200ug already, so I decided to take the whole tab. I took it and during the come up felt quite uncomfortable and extremely anxious. It was my first time tripping in a while and I was unsure what LSD would feel like. I suggested we move and go for a walk to a new spot, so we did and found a bench with an amazing view. We set up there and my friend calmed me down until the come up was over. It ended up being one of the most visually pleasing moments in my life. As it started to kick in I kept telling my friend that it looked just like those YouTube 'acid simulation' videos where they go for a walk in the forest and you see the greens and blues and reds stretch out of everything as well as faces in the ground. During the trip I had my first ever closed-eye visuals of traveling though colorful light tunnels that were pulsing with the music. Truly incredible.   


**The dilemma:**

So here is my dilemma. If you read above, you would see that cannabis has been my main solution to the problems I've been facing. It lets me have my own time and relaxes my body and mind. It puts me in a space where I can almost 'regenerate'. The problem, is my parents. For various reasons, which I wont explain, are not allowing me to smoke weed until I have finished High School.   


This has been something that they have said before but also something that I have protested against many times. I have proven to them that it does not affect my marks, if anything they get better. And that my life is *more* balanced when I am allowed to smoke. (eg. I go to gym more often, I am generally happier, I work more and better)   
This is because of what I said before about it giving my mind a break from all of the stress, anxiety, overthinking, schoolwork, expectations and OCD. As well as my body a break from constantly moving and twitching and the tension that causes. BUT, It is of no use. They have stood their ground and are not budging. They test me constantly with a 5 stage tester. And if I test positive for THC (and im sure any of the other drugs on the test). There will be severe consequences.  


**\[TL:DR\] The actual question:**

So after typing all of that, the question I have for you, my fellow Reddit Drug users, is what alternative drug do you recommend for me? I have tried to explain as much about me as possible and my experiences with the drugs I have tried to give you a good idea of how I feel about them and how I have reacted to them all.   
 I have been doing a lot of research and have been trying to find what drugs there are that fit my criteria as best as possible. To make it simpler for you, here are a couple of things I would like:

* Most importantly, it should relieve me from as much of the shit I struggle with as possible. (OCD, Anxiety, Depression, Twitching etc.)
* I have to be able to take the drug fairly often. (one that doesn't build up tolerance too quick) 
* It has to somewhat relax me, I don't mind if I get some visuals or wacky thoughts, But I don't want it to keep me up at night.
* It should be non-addictive/low potential for abuse.
* It would be much preferred it there was no comedown or at least minimal withdrawal symptoms.

I know that this criteria is kinda hard to fit, but I'm kinda just asking what the *best fit* would be. And who better to ask than the glorious r/drugs themselves.  
The 2 drugs that have stood out to me most so far, are **Ketamine** and **2C-B**. They seem to tick the most boxes for me.. but I'm very interested to see what 'the experts' have to say.  
 Thanks.

I know it probably won’t kill you but I’m just wondering if it would put a significant amount of extra stress on the heart while exercising. 

I usually take kratom first thing in the morning, eat breakfast, then hop on my bike for a couple miles. I’ve been doing this for a year with no problem, it never feels like my heart is working extra or anything like that. Lately I’ve been combining kratom with coffee in the morning and since I have no caffeine tolerance the combo feels amazing. Also since I’m home all day now thanks to covid I’ve also been eating small edibles in the morning because why not lol. I vape and have a ton of abv so I’ll make edibles that aren’t strong enough to make me do I thing all day, but definitely enough to give me a buzz. 

Anyways I’ve been doing this the past week and I feel like I definitely noticed that my blood pressure feel a bit higher, usually it’s when the coffee and kratom first kicks in as the edibles usually take an extra hour. I think it’s mainly the coffee tbh. Usually it spikes up whenever I stand up too fast and goes away quickly, but I feel like it’s also making my heart pump harder when I exercise. Today I was biking on this combo and at first it was great but towards the end my chest was feeling a little tight and uncomfortable. I should mention I also have anxiety which can cause this so I’m not sure if it was anxiety or if it was my heart. Anyways I went back home sat down and it went away after a couple minutes of rest. 

Anyways I’m just wonder how unhealthy it is to do this. I’ll probably cut out the caffeine if it continues to be a problem or bike in the afternoon once everything starts to wear off a little.

I “forget” what I look like every time recently, and looking at pictures doesn’t work (my camera roll is now full of selfies without success) because I can’t seem to make any sens of my facial features. It is not ego death, my ego is still really present, tormenting me with questions : “could I be ugly??!”. Sounds funny now but in the moment it’s suffering. 

Most of the time I value myself, but I do think a lot about my appearance and am self conscious sometimes. It happened with three psychedelic substances, the three last trips I had. I am sick of this because I don’t enjoy life in these moments, and I feel powerless. I am worried it will always happen and psychedelics are ruined for me. Also it puts me down even though I try to contain it, so I feel like I ruin the mood for others. 

Maybe it is the message that I need to work on myself in sober life to enjoy the pleasures of drugs. But it even happens with weed.

Later ill feel drained. Sometimes I take 20 and then 10 a few hours later if it hasn’t worked. Idk. I don’t know a ton about evekeo other than what I have read. Anyone know how it compares to the strength of Adderall or vyvanse? Used to have same issue with Adderall, then realized I was simply taking too much. Lowered my dose to 20 mgs and it worked better. Not a very long time though. These drugs have never had the same effects on me as my friends. My friends can take 20 mg Adderall XR and be zoomin for the entire day. I’ll be ready for bed by 5 pm.

About 2 months ago I took 300ug of LSD and 2 hours later consumed 150mg of 85% pure MDMA. During the comeup I was watching the television show ""the office"". It started normal enough. But as the MDMA began taking effect I felt that the show had loads of hidden references and meaning. Almost every segment I heard and saw things that I believed were purposely made for people that are on psychedelics. 

This experience is usually typical for myself. But after the MDMA really kicked in the tv and everything around it became difficult to see because of vivid visual distortion. I closed my eyes, and ego death set in as I forgot who or where I was. I saw a single dot of strange hue in a sea of darkness. The dot was all of creation, and I saw it exert a massive amount of effort in giving birth to the universe. 

Afterwards, it was tired, and faded away as its creation continued on and multiplied. I proceeded to live a multitude of lives, each only lasting for no more than a few seconds. And I seemed to be traveling through time, first seeing ancient people's such as mayans looking at me knowingly and attempting to pass onto me some sort of knowledge. Then moving on and on through later time periods. I saw thousands of people live and die, but when they died they where reabsorbed into the next generation. It was both frightening and reassuring knowing that if I was dead, a part of me would continue on. 

After this experience I've struggled to understand what I saw and if it had meaning. I've been an atheist for years, but now after that experience I consider myself more agnostic. I've thought a lot about what I saw, but it's much like trying to interpret a dream. It's hard to tell what's important and what's not, what has meaning and what was just drug induced hallucination. 

What are some of your powerful psychedelic experiences? Do you believe that trips can have meaning or do you think it's all just random musings of the mind whilst intoxicated?

I had no prior experience with shrooms before taking them. At first I started with the largest stem in the bag, and one or two of the bigger smaller ones. Then I ate a few more of the mushrooms after about 20 minutes.

As I sat and waited I thought about what it might be like. I figured it might be somewhat similar to a strong acid trip with kaleidoscopic textures and such.

I was so fucking wrong.

*30 minutes in:*

The first noticable sign of the come up happened as I was looking at a wall slightly shift and buldge (or breathing). 

I decided a walk might be nice at this point because I was getting a bit anxious. I threw on my coat and headed down nearby road that is straight forward and empty. 

Then it hits me *hard*. The land expanded around me and everything looked absolutely redefined. It felt as if I were on an **alien planet, or dimension.**

I closed my eyes and I had some very nice and flashy  CEVs. The geometric lines reminded me of some sort of light show, or a UFO. 

Still walking down this road. The surroundings are more fantasy like. I felt like I was in a story book.

**End of the road:**

While most of the walk was cool, I had reached a point where it had got rather dark and somewhat sketchy. The road being dark and empty added to this effect. I couldn't help but think that something may come out of it and get me. 
I held it down and kept my cool. It's the mushrooms and I'll be fine.

The dark area of the road leads to another sketch scene. A lightpost shines over a small house which is empty of any interior, a piece of machinery sitting in it's lot.
Across the street from that is a seperate dirt road that ventures into black. I had almost been convinced that it was a vision I was having.
Ventuing on past this scene would bring me back into total darkness. But that is not what made me turn around...

Sporadic black shadows danced rapidly in the corners of my vision, there being one i had full glance of for second so it felt too real. 
I felt a sinister presence - and that I was in danger.
I felt unwelcome in that small area.

The walk back was far less enjoyable now. The world was looking more alive and alien, with some darker areas giving me the idea that evil lies within them. 

It was't just because it was dark - my whole perception and how things physically looked was warped *drastically.* For a few minutes I had even felt like I was being followed around. 

*After the walk:*

I got to a nice little private area and took some time to relax.

As I stood there things began to become more interesting and charming. I felt **euphoric, confident, relaxed, and in a lucid dream state.** Exactly like being in a dream.

As I stood there taking it all in there were thin lines of red and blue coming from my body and curving down into the earth. It felt that it was a very raw connection to the planet somehow. 

**Over time the shrooms definitely kept getting stronger and stronger. At some points it would feel like the peak levels off just to have me shot back into orbit. This wasn't always fun..**

*Another stroll through Dream land:*

I decided to head on another walk, this time going down a road I usually take to get to different areas of town by foot. It's very dark in this area but its more open space and nice. 

As I walked I began to talk more to myself. The introspection lead me to do this because I was making a lot of realizations about myself and life and speaking about it to myself felt beneficial for me.

The mushrooms were definitely still increasing throughout this walk, minutes passing lead to harder tripping. 

But something about the scenary was strange. The grass was cut, the leaves racked, the hills.. flattened? 

No thats not possible. 
But I swear by this that where hills were there were no hills. At least not then.

I began hating it all. It was all environmentally wrong. 

I gazed at a gas station that was next to me. I use to work at this place. It was pretty high quality with modern gas pumps and aesthetics. But from the distance I was at it looked completely alien. The gas pumps looked 100x more geometrically additioned and the building looked SO FUCKIN WEIRD. Fr Im taking a moment to share a raw opinion - I didnt know visuals like this were POSSIBLE! NOT AT ALL! There were things on it and about it that arent actually there. And I had no control of it. The shrooms really did bring me to an alien reality.

Which was quite scary, actually.

I had convinced myself that I had some how time travelled. Everything around me was shocking yet so empty and lifeless. It all said ""money made this"". Like roman structures. No life. 

I believe being this shocked gave me some serious physical symptoms. I began believe that I was dying. I got fatigued, dizzy, short of breath and I felt pains in my chest , jaw , shoulders , and arms.

**You'll hate me for this:**

I took out my phone, and called 911. I wasn't alright. I forgot to mention that at this point I was extremely depressed. *Extremely.* Earlier that day I had recieved some disturbing news from my attorney. I won't go into it right now, but if anyone wants to know I will share the details.

I feel like such an asshole now thinking back on all this..

I called and a woman answers. ""911 whats the address of the emergency"" 

I calmly told her that I might need help because I don't feel well. And that everything was wrong. Before this I kept saying ""No... no... NO!"" Saying no over and over for the last 20 minutes, in intervals of a few minutes. (These ticks carried on to this morning when I woke up and wasn't tripping anymore. 

She stayed on the line and let me ramble but she was clearly annoyed that I wasn't in any immediate danger. My delusional being was hoping I could get some medical help from an expert on what was going on. Like I said, i felt that I was literally dying.

""I'm sorry for wasting your time."" Then I hung up. 

Well, shit. A minute later one cop pulls up to me. Then another pulls up behind him. 

They get out of their cruisers, ask me to sit, and begin asking me a series of questions. I remained relaxed and calm until a third pulled up. I raised my hands and , terrified, I began asking what I did wrong.

 They kept asking me ""Did a traumatic event happen?"" There wasn't one in the time frame of my trip. But my mind kept going back to the news I heard from the court.

And ""Do you feel like hurting someone or yourself? We just want to know.""

I was feeling hopeless and there was a sinking and unsettling feeling in my chest. 

I told them everything. The greatest epiphany I had in this moment was that it was okay to be confidently transparent.

But that calmness didnt come back until after I had explained to them exactly how their presence was affecting me. I felt that they had ulterior movies. I believed I was going to be killed. 

After some more chat and realizing I was okay, I began answering questions and talking with them.

It went very smoothly. I told them why i called, how everything feels dead, the world. And how I felt I was dying. 

We chatted and I asked them if I was free to leave. They simply told me it was fine and because I had actually enjoyed the interaction at the end I got their names and introduced myself without all the obligation of having to do so.

They also definitely knew I was tripping.

Thats as far as I remember for that walk. I went home and had more intense visions of very strange things. I cant really put it into words.

But thats pretty much all of it.

So yesterday me and some friends did some MDMA and I had an amazing roll. I started of by taking about 150mg MDMA, 45 minutes later I took the rest of my MDMA (50mg). When I felt I was getting over my peak (about 3 hours in) after which I took about 10mg of 2C-B. When the 2C-B starting kicking in (1 hour later) I took about 30mg of ketamine. This really made me feel the waves of MDMA coming back again which I never had before.

I went to sleep after 12hours. I could only sleep for 2hours. After that i felt very low for 2/3days. I couldnt eat well. I had to force myself to eat so that i could be healthy again. Im doing well everyday after. But its been 1week already and i still dont feel back to 100% normal. I feel weak and ill like feelings sometimes (especially in the morning) i dont feel normal at all.

time of ingesting Olanzapine (Zyprexa): 9hrs into my trip

Olanzapine: dosage - 5mg, got it from a friend still in its blister packaging

Mental disorders: None

10 minutes after i started feeling something has gone wrong. I noticed my trip started coming back up a little again but in a bad way. My mind started telling me something isn't right. My lips went dry. I felt my mind being compromised. My instinct told me to not look in the mirror or any part of my body.

I later got driven to the hospital. I noticed symptoms of psychosis (i dont have psychosis nor does anyone in my family/extended family has it) such as paranoia, thinking words written has special meaning for me, sensing things that exist when they dont, when the doctor was pointing her finger towards my eye and telling me to follow their finger while they test me i was feeling as if she was going to thrust her fingers into my eye. I then stayed overnight incase i totally lose it and freak out but luckily i managed to hold it together.

I couldn't believe this either. Ive read many posts saying antipsychotics/olanzapine can kill a trip and that people can personally attest to this, although there were a small number of posts that recommends against taking antipsychotics to stop a trip. Its up to you to believe the validity of this post.

But a part of me is just stuck on this perversion. 

So basically...I am fairly new to smoking crack myself. Just a few months.  Started late as a middle aged man. So I am hooked on it, but I am hooked in it in conjunction with a fetish/desire that makes it even worse and more expensive. 

So whenever I come across some extra spending cash, I buy a big amount of crack, and  always hang out with girls that smoke. Usually the same couple girls I know that smoke.

They are young and very attractive.  They dont look like a typical ""crack ho"" Not skinny or missing teeth or anything.  Very pretty faces, lovely breasts,  feet. Just cute and pretty. 

Anyhow, so if you smoke or have before you know how it is. It feels great, and you just wanna keep smoking. 

But..when you get down to the last bit you have...you either will try to buy more, or get more money..Sometimes, it just hits that point, and that it. Either broke,  or maybe nobody is around, just cant get any.

So, what I like to do, is get a nice batch. Maybe 200-300 worth. And then I call up one of these girls to see if they wanna hang out. Once they know I have a good amount of smoke, they are very happy to hang out and smoke my shit. 

So when we meet up.. I will usually take out about half of what I got, and kinda make it seem like , that all I got  But it's a nice amount.  

So, I put down a few slabs, break them up a bit. I put a pile near me, and then I put a pile for the girl. So maybe 100 worth for me . 100 for her. 

Well, I smoke pretty heavy, but for some reason any girl I smoke with seems to smoke alot more , and her pile runs out faster. 

So when I see she only has a few pieces left, and I still have a decent amount, I will usually grab one of my pieces, and say, ""oh here, if you want this?"" 

They usually at first say ohh..no that's ok. Thanks. But I say, ah go ahead. Your good. Then they smile and say ok thanks and they take it. 

Well I do that a couple times..then I stop. I let them finish off their pile, and I still have a few pieces left. 

Once there pile is gone.I see the. Starting to scrape their pipe. They are able to get a couple nice scrapes in, but I can sense that desperate need kicking in on them.

by this time I usually have just a couple pieces left. 3 maybe 4.  And I still have my other half hidden away, she doesn't know or think I have any more. 

So I smoke a piece or 2. While I sense the girls desperate need kicking in more and more. 

This is where my perverse fetish kicks in. I have 2 pieces left. Just sitting there. And I know she will soon ask or hi t that she would like one of those pieces. 

So she usually kinda gives the puppy dog eyes, and will ask, ""could I have that other piece, please?""

And I respond..""Damn...I only got 2...I kinda wanted to hold it down"" She frowns , and just kinda sits there a moment. So then I smoke a piece,  in front of her. And I can sense how bad she wishes that hit was hers. 

Then there is the last piece I have sitting there. After I just took my hit , and I feel good and have satisfied look on my face. 

She will usually just be looking through her phone at this point...upset and feening. 

Then I would look at her and say. "" I dunno. Who you think wants this last piece more, you or me?""

She will kinda have a look and then say ""I'm fucking dying for a hit right now""

Then my perverse thoughts kick in. I will start to play mind game and say "" Hmm..so what would you do for this hut right now?""

She kinda get mad but is like ""Whatever...what you mean? Like what you want me to do?""

This is where my perverse fun starts. Usually I will start off small...like tell her I want to see her tits.  She pulls her shirt up and shows them. 

Then I may say...mmm..let me touch them a little...she looks annoyed,  but she says..ok. hurry up. 

So I touch a little...then I get the piece and give it to her. And say..aww ok I'm sorry. Here. Thanks though. You have such pretty breasts. 

I love the look of her, and her demeanor when I give her that piece. She grabs it so quick, puts it on the pipe, and wastes no time to smoke it up. 

She takes her hit. And then I see the annoyed, desperate look, fade away. She smiles and is just like...""whew!""

Now we both just chillin smoke a cig or whatnot. And I will usually kinda rub her legs while she nice and high.

Well, as far as she knows theres no more dope.  So after a few moments,  I see her going through her phone. I know she is trying g to see if anyone else is around d to get her dope or money. She thinks I dont know.

I can see her frustration with some of the texts she is reading . Probally because her other male friends are not around, or dont have anything or not willing. 

We both want to smoke more. But I try to hide it. She starts to ask me...if I wanna get anymore..

Then the game begins..I tell her I do t really need to, I spent what I could. She tries to see if I can spend just 50..then 40...then 20..

The. I tell her..well I did get extra, but I wanted to hold it down ,and might need to sell it. 

But his time, her desperation is in full effect.  I pull out what I have , but only take a couple pieces out.

The. I say ok  we can smoke a little. But I want a rush when I hit it. And I wanna mess around with her.

So she asks what I want. This is where my fetish shines. I love just being able to tell her what I want and she will do it. 

I tell her I wanna kiss her feet while I take a hit. Or I want her put her hand on my penis.or feel her breasts..kiss them. 

Now when I smoke, I cannot get an erection,  but I still get a rush and it feels good. So there is not sexual intercourse.  

But at this point, I love this feeling. Because now,I only giving g her one maybe 2 pieces at a time.

And I love being able to make her do almost anything.  And to hear her keep asking and begging for another hit.

Now I am the stupid one being used here. But I know I'm being used. But I am also using her. I love feeling like I am in control of her ,for the time. And the feeling that she is pretty much at my mercy. She has no control and all she can think about is how to get her next hit from me. 

Anyways. So eventually my dope or money does run out, and its goodbye. I go home broke and ashamed of myself, and the horrible comedown. 

She leaves, and finds the next guy to give her free shit or money.

Ive had literally no one to talk to besides Reddit for years now over the course of 5 or 6 accounts

I only turn 19 soon, so my life should have so much ahead, but I’ve hated it for a very long time. I just want to escape

The only thing I relate to and can actually cry too, (as nothing does anymore, including death) has been music. I’m extremely apathetic, hide in my room and rarely leave, but when I do it’s to smoke. I’ve weighed 100-115 for the past 3-4 years, currently at 104. 

I realize I’m so young, and thus more immature than I could even imagine, but I can’t keep doing this forever. Drugs and music have been the only things keeping me going this long, but all I want to do is rap, or just die already

I tried rapping, but it’s been nothing but setback after setback. 

Can’t use GarageBand due to phone problems so I need a new one, aka too much money. I hate everything about myself, including my voice. I would try autotune to see if it could help but honestly I hate (Atleast MAJOR) auto tuning. It doesn’t sound real at all, but the free shit I had access to just made me sound like shit still

I haven’t even graduated high school yet, even though I should have almost 2 years ago. I hardly do anything but sleep anymore. Everyday feels harder than the last. 

I’ve come close to dying and ODing quite a few times, a couple intentional but never actually ended up killing me, different reasons but the last was because my mom found me unconscious in my piss, unresponsive and barely breathing so she called the parameds

No one in my family truly knows me, as I don’t talk about depression as my mom shunned it with my siblings and made me seem like it was this horrible disease. I convinced her I was just partying essentially, just “having fun”, and she bought it. 

I do all this self destructive shit but none of my family notice, my mom’s the only one who knows this shit but she just thinks I’m a rebel or something

I felt like my head was gonna blow up and I couldnt type faster than 10wpm but became hyperfocused on whatever I was doing. I dosed nicotine at this point to avoid a potential coma. It woke me up at the cost of amplifying the buzzing or vibrating feeling encompassing my whole body and making my motor control even sloppier. I smoked some weed when those effects started to leave which was about 2 hours later and the euphoria was pretty awesome listening to music playing my favorite fps.

The title may set off red flags as it should.  This should not be replicated in hopes of the same things happening as I would have never dropped if I had recognized my psychotic state.  

I would like to start this off by saying I have always been a little “odd” but would like to say I am pretty good at hiding it.  I know I have had OCD since I have been able to remember.  This OCD has manifested into different types of anxiety triggers throughout my life also (Could possibly be responsible for THC Psychosis).  I do know there is no underlying schizophrenia in my family that could be responsible for the psychosis.  

To start it off I have been smoking since I was 14 and heavily since I was around 15 (gram+ a day sometimes up to 2.5g) usually around the evening time.  I have been “in control” of my use some may say for the past 2 years (am 17 now).  What I mean by that is I do not put more important things in front of weed, or at least I don’t think so for the most part (volunteer hours, hold a job while in school maintaining good grades etc) I’d say I smoke quite a bit but would always be the guy that people would say “could handle his weed.”  This all changed some time around two months ago.  

I was doing my regular thing smoking late at night, but I had taken 100mg of tramadol around 45 minutes prior.  I have only taken tramadol one other time and smoked to accompany it so I had assumed it was ok (I know how terribly wrong I am now lol).  That night I had taken probably 3 decent size dabs alongside the tramadol and a few big bowls of grass.  When I started smoking the grass (after dabs and tramadol) something felt extremely off.  I was getting cotton mouth like no other, it wasn’t even cotton mouth it was more like cotton chest and throat.  I remember trying to breathe and barely being able to.  There was also no saliva in my mouth or anywhere in my throat, it felt like every drop of water had left my body completely.  This scared the shit out of my so I started googling stuff and entertaining the thought of something terrible happening  (never do this).  This is when the chest pain started.  It almost felt like my heart was sinking into whatever direction I would lay down or sit.  I remember putting my fingers on my neck and my heart rate felt like it could have been in the upper 100s.  I remember standing up and feeling very panicked.  It was like my body was hurting like it was never hurting before and I also had this strange sense of impending doom I had only ever had from nightmares before.  I sprinted back into my house feeling like I was going to black out any second on the way to tell my parents to take me to the ER but I than thought of the consequences.  I sort of forced myself to deal with it by saying I had not done anything that night that could be ending my life.  I remember sitting down on the ground in the middle of the mud room in my house convincing myself I was not dying, but the heart rate and chest pain did not leave until I sobered up, only slowed down slightly.  

The next couple of days were very strange for me to say the least looking back on it.  Anytime my mind was not occupied, I would feel the intense chest pain.  I would smoke very little these nights as I had no clue I had even gone through psychosis.  I would get the same affects if I wasn’t occupied while high and was definitely dependent on weed for sleep at the time.  I would have these frequent “panic attack” episodes, while I was high or not, that ended up landing me in the ER around a week later.  My parents were scared that if I brought up the weed incident there would be undesired consequences so I did not.  My family is in a good place financially and runs a successful small business that keeps us well fed, but both of my parents are high functioning addicts (weed / alcohol) and aren’t firm believers of the system.  As expected they ran many tests that all came back negative and told me I was in great health.  This left me very puzzled, at this point I don’t think I knew what psychosis was or was to ignorant to think a “normal” person like me could go through such a thing.  This is so ironic because thinking back on it at the time I was definitely psychotic, but not on the outside if that makes sense.  I would convince myself weird thoughts that would reinforce rabbit holes I had dug myself into if that makes sense.  For example I saw a tiny piece of cardboard (shaped nothing like L, it was a rectangle if I recall it looked like it could have been off a cereal box or something lol) somewhere around the house and convinced myself my family were L users and weren’t telling me haha.  I want to make it clear this behavior was never apparent to me.  I never knew how strange my view of the world had become.  So I kept smoking for sleep, just in smaller amounts to mitigate pain... until the trip.  

I had been getting my LSD off the dw for the most part up until this point and had a sheet coming in from NL that I was very excited about.  I had gotten acid from this guy before and knew it was very very strong, one tab of this guys stuff would get me to a place I had never been off a good bit more than a tab from where I live in the US.  After the sheet arrived I decided to trip the following day at home with out a sitter (I know another bad idea).  

I dropped at 8:00 PM the night of a pretty normal day during quarantine.  The tabs did not taste weird from what I remember but I may have been a little stoned at the time.  I do remember they were hard to swallow for extremely tiny pieces of paper, I gagged while swallowing the two tabs but didn’t think anything of it because of my poor gag reflex and not tasting anything.  The dosage was supposed to be 100ug, but my guy had to reship and put a nice letter talking about a “surprise” and it was my “birthday” (Could have just been fake letter for USPS). The art was also very different from the art I saw advertised.  I know how hard it is to get a lot of LSD on blotter paper, but there may be a possibility it could have been stronger acid as he has acid supposedly rated up to 300ug a hit.  Keep in mind I also had basically zero tolerance at the time, the last time I tripped was a month or two ago.

Nothing eventful happened from 8:00 to 8:30.  I was playing games and had noticed I started tripping a lot quicker than usual but thought nothing of it.  Around 8:45 it started to get weird.  I was getting intense visuals 45 minutes in like I had never gotten before, the visuals felt odd too.  I remember laying down in my bed, looking at my phone, and getting intense lockjaw like I have never felt in my life.  I than walked outside and my chest was hurting similar to the psychosis, but my neck was stiff and my back was hurting also.  I felt like I was almost drunk swaying back and forth while walking with no real good thoughts at this point.  “What is going on.”  ... “Acid has never made me feel like this.”  This all happened around 8:45 - 9:45.  I than came back inside and laid down again, with a very bad involuntary headspace alongside the intense pain I was feeling.  I than started sweating balls.  I took my shirt off and was sweating like I had drank a couple bottles of water and was in 100+ degree heat.  This alongside the swaying / weird pain I had never experienced is why I have “nbome?” In the title. 
Following this I remember googling “laced acid” like a madman (big no no).  The words on the screen were disappearing as I was reading them (which has happened to me on L before) and I was starting to get real scared because of the pain/feelings.  I than had this strange feeling everything in my life was wrong and everyone was playing a trick on me.  The best way I could put it was life was a movie and I was the “weird main character” that all the side characters were constantly judging.  At this point I was trying to get outside my head so hard.  I remember putting on some good music and just feeling so terrible and sad.  I than put my head down and went to sleep (biggest no no).  I was probably out by around 10:00.  I did not sleep long though, and when I woke up something was very off.  I remember waking up some time around 10:30 and looking at the time on my phone and feeling nothing.  Feelings did not even exist it was like nothing mattered.  I did not have anything important in my head at all at this time, not like any LSD experience I have had before.  I remember violently dropping my phone on the ground beside my bed and feeling / thinking literally nothing.  It was the most intense melancholy reality I have ever been in, if the word “neutral” was a person it was me at the time.  This is when I start not recalling the trip so if things get a little contradictory in the time line / hard to follow stay with me.  At one point past 10 I remember walking outside with this intense feeling of wanting help.  I walked up to my mom and just said I felt very sick (she was a little tipsy probably didn’t notice my wide eyes and the sense of terror in them).  I also remember petting my cat on the back porch, I remember this very vividly.  She is a big cat and is the nicest cat I have ever had, I felt very connected to her.  I remember looking into her wide eyes, probably as wide as mine at the time, and confessing to her how connected I was to her.  It was like she understood where I was and came to rub up against me and tell me everything was going to be okay.  This was one of the last things I remember as myself, the rest of the story will be pieced together from others perspectives, these “flash ins” I would get during the intense loss of everything, or from thoughts I have pieced together throughout the last couple of weeks.  

My parents told me they heard lots of manic laughing around midnight that night and thought I was having good fun on some games.  They than told me I came into their room and told them I loved them, but I had pissed myself and I was completely out of it.  The strangest thing is I have these “flash ins” of the events after blackout and remember a flash in of being in my parents room and them saying “what are you doing” or something along those lines.  The next couple of hours my parents spent trying to figure out what I had taken, nothing very important from their perspective around this point.  The next flash in I had my parents were asking me what I took as I was sitting on the couch.  My response was saying loudly “ALL OF THE DRUGS and laughing hysterically.”  This is when things start to get a little crazy.  From my perspective I had convinced myself completely that all drugs were terrible from the POV of the system and that acid was a metaphor for bad/evil and I had done the “evil” to myself.  They than asked me “was it acid.” This is what really fucked with my brain from the little I remember of flashing back into it.  They had realized I had done the evil.  I was confessing of me doing the evil to them and it was one of the hardest things I had ever done, and the worst part was I thought death was coming and it was my punishment for being so evil, so I embraced death completely.  The next couple of hours were spent literally “seeing the light” from the “flash ins” I have stored in my memory.  I want to make it very apparent these “flash ins” are the only thing I really remember and they felt very brief but were separated by periods of time so long  I don’t think I could put them into words.  At one point I’m pretty sure I had convinced myself all the tension in the world right now ontop of COVID was all connected to me and that me doing the evil was actually a good thing that would help end hate and eternal suffering.  This is absolutely crazy to me because I have never been spiritual or religious whatsoever.  I was before the trip usually one to laugh at religion and see it as a way of controlling the masses as many of the religious people in my life I believe are encapsulated of hate and seem to make poor choices/ live a contradictory life to the religion they so “praised.”  Now I was and still am for the most part, a believer of science, I just don’t know if I’m a believer of extreme “progress” anymore.  I definitely have this strange feeling of wanting to read the Bible also.  When I was being sacrificed I was just letting it happen too, during the trip I never tried to kill myself or hurt anyone like the violent horror trips you hear of, I was literally just laying down on the couch blabbering nonsense from midnight to 5 AM.  The worst thing I did my parents told me was run into a table when I was first confronted by them, but I remember doing this in a “flash in” and am pretty sure it’s because I was scared of them.  Now what really makes me think I took a drug other than LSD was the weird themes that made themselves apparent throughout my blackout / unconsciousness.  Apparently I was saying the hard r and the word “spics” over and over again at a point in the trip.  I was also overtly sexual as they have videos of me saying “boogie down bitch” while in complete blackout mode face down on the couch lmao.  I would consider myself a decently reserved respectful person who would not normally ever say hateful things like that or have them even appear in my mind for the most part.  I could go on forever about the craziness of the trip but think that is all of value that has to be said about the events from that night.  

The next morning I woke up to my parents in my face understandably angry at around 10:00 AM, my actions were so irresponsible that night and before the trip in general.  I was in terrible shape, I felt a different level of frail I have never felt before that morning.  It felt like I had no water in my body, I was dry as a desert.  I lost at least seven pounds of water weight that night as I weighed myself sometime in the AM.  Food and water tasted absolutely terrible for at least 30 hours after the trip and I felt like my bones could snap at any moment.  I should also mention I was still tripping sack when I woke up and could barely correlate my thoughts.  I tried giving my mom some sort of an apology but it’s like I just had a hard time talking in a manor that didn’t sound jumbled.  I know I didn’t sound crazy crazy, but I definitely had wide eyes still and was having a hard time putting my thoughts into words.  I would say I was getting peak acid visuals I would get off of one tab almost 20 hours after the trip.  But the visuals just seemed off / very very bright and green and I felt nothing in my mind.  I just felt like I was existing similarly to I did before I blacked out, not a good type of existing either.

After the initial shit feeling after the trip I feel like I have been to every single corner and crevice in my brain and uncovered a plethora of things from my “character in the movie I was playing” that just didn’t make any sense or contribute to my well being (deep anxieties / ocd etc).  When I continued to  try to push them away (which usually would happen with marijuana as it has always helped me relax in the past) I would go to a really bad place.  A place where I would convince myself I am in a family full of crazies who are described by the system as drug addicts with mental disorders.  But this is was always puzzling to me as my family is doing very good and is successful despite the differences from what is “normal.”  My father and mother came from poverty and both have 4 year degrees + and run a successful business that not only helps people who may be in bad situations get work (my parents have plenty of felons working for them who came from broken homes and are only felons because of drug addiction / possession).  I would also get these thoughts that I am a “crazy person” in the eyes of the system even though I have always been told how much of a grip I have and how driven I am by my teachers and parents.  These thoughts would manifest like 90% of the time when I was smoking after this (I know I am crazy for smoking after this I have been dependent on it for sleep for a while).  It has been so hard reinforcing my perspective sometimes compared to the systems but I am trying and am taking a much needed long break from weed which has stopped the bad perspective completely alongside convincing myself that I am at a good point in life and not a crazy person.  When I can convince myself these things I feel amazing, like a new being, I feel almost enlightened.  Like I said I was one to laugh at religion before this experience but have found myself gravitating towards it even if I’m not trying to, and when I convince myself religion is false and a way to control the masses I start hurting again, (chest pain / emotional pain etc).  I also seem to see the world through different eyes.  I feel a connectedness to nature and animals and find myself crying at how beautiful the world is quite often now.  This may be just a coincidence but I have had multiple dragonflies attach to me randomly after the trip.  They literally just attach to me and don’t leave, I don’t touch them as I’m pretty sure it can hurt them but it is very strange.

I was 4 years sober, the exact time I was with my ex. I broke up with her recently, I developed feelings for another woman. I started smoking pot again about 7 months ago, I had quit with my ex about a year prior. Now I know what you're thinking, the title says 4 years, well that's more about hard drugs (anything other than weed really). I had developed a codeine addiction after taking them too often for a back pain that seemed more ghostly then real on most days. My ex had gone on a night out, she ended up sniffing ket and I decided that night that fuck it, imma smoke me some pot! Well fast forward and I'm sat here at 5:15 at my mum's house (I'm 24, lived with ex for 4 years in our own house) coked up, drinking, smoking bud and popping a few codeines. My life has turned into a mess in literally 10 days. I seshed a few days ago for like 4 days. It's getting out of hand really. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dunno what I expect by writing all this down.  I know a few tweaker sorts will probably read it and enjoy it. I just feel stuck. Like life lost it's sparkle, it's just a boring monochrome still image glued to my eyes. I dunno what else to do. I know that getting wrecked isn't the answer but I can't help myself from just taking it to the edge.

  I had moved to Oklahoma for college and was living off campus with two other guys from the school. The college I was going to was under FAA guildlines which met everyone in the school was subject to random drug tests. Before I left I would smoke weed from time to time. 
 Asking around I found out weed was 4x more exspensive than I was used to and also Oklahoma was pushing for drug related felonies to try to crack down on drugs.(2014) 
 I remembered I had some Scooby snacks left over in my car from my first bad trip. I decided the issue I had was I got motion sickness from smoking while driving, so smoking stationary would be better, or so I thought. 
  I joined my roommates on the balcony and started smoking a small pitch of spice I put in a swisher. I instantly started spinning and everything got droopy. 
I went and sat on the couch and starting watching Family Guy and for some reason everytime Quagmire  talked I would crack up laughing. 
 Before all this happened my roommates and I had pizza buffet. My stomach felt like some grabbed it and twisted. I started getting shooting pains through my head and got really sick. I went to laugh and started to throw up.
 I took off down the hall trying to keep the vomit in my mouth, but it's spraying past my hands and all over the hall walls. I get int the restroom, start throwing up in the sink, move to the toilet and end up gagging in tub. 
 I had vomit in my lungs and couldn't breathe. My roommates called 911 and I started to black out. I remember staring the EMT in the eyes and him threatening to call the cops. He told me spice was a felony and I would go to jail . He decided not to call the cops since I was in college but said if he had to come back I was going to jail. 
 The rest was a blur. I took a five Mile ambulance ride to OSU with no insurance.

I'm posting here since r/ADHD has a strict no cannabis rule.

When I was a boy I was diagnosed with ADHD and decided not to go with ADHD medication the doctor recommended since I was taught that mental medication was for 'weirdos' (I was very wrong). I went to therapy for a while but that fizzled as it didn't do me much help. Eventually, I got acquainted with weed and have been casual toker ever since.

This has been going for around 7 years up until a little under 5 months ago I was let go from my job due to the pandemic. Since then it's been a battle trying to find a new job and be productive overall. 

Ever since then I decided to stop smoking while attempting to 'job search' in case I had to undergo any drug testing mandatory during hiring. However, what I've found is that without weed I've fallen into hard depression and have lost nearly all of my motivation to do anything. It's gotten to the point where days can go by and I don't do anything. I know I'm not addicted since I can go without it without fiending (and don't really want to start again in case I do get a job) but I'm not going to lie and say weed hasn't been a crutch for me. I think weed did for me what the ADHD medication that I skipped on was supposed to. I tried talking to my doctor about this but she thought I was just building a case to score medication for recreational purposes so now I'm just here feeling like I'm rotting away due to the inattentiveness and all the procrastination.

Overall, I think I'm understanding where I'm at now is my true baseline and it's pretty demoralizing.

I am currently a junior in college and didn’t start drinking until I came to college. All my friends drank in high school, it just wasn’t my thing. Now that I’m in college though, I drink a lot. It wasn’t excessive at first, I’d go to a party or two every weekend or every other, and drink a couple beers and go back to my dorm and pass out. Since I moved into an apartment, I started drinking more but still not super excessively. Averaged out, at least once a week for about 6 months. When quarantine hit and I moved back in with my parents, I was drinking every. single. night. So from about March-June I drank every single night alone in my room just to help me fall asleep very quickly. I used to have a lot of trouble sleeping so I figured getting drunk and passing out was my best bet. It was easy. Now that I have moved back in my apartment, I’d say I drink 5/7 nights a week with only one of them being with other people. It helps me fall asleep or I just feel like it I guess. Recently I have been seriously considering the fact that I might be on my way to alcoholism or already be an alcoholic. I’ve always heard “you can’t be am alcoholic in college” and that has been reassuring, but reddit has definitely taught me that that is not the case. I want to know if any of you have had similar experiences. Did you alcoholism start in college and continue or were you able to get over bingedrinking once you graduated?

Here it goes...I have a young family member coming to stay with me for the next four months. He is coming because he says that he wants to change the course of his life and part of that includes giving up drugs (seems to be mostly pot and pills but we haven’t discussed his history in depth). Part of the requirements for staying with me will be that he has to pass regular drug screenings. Here is where you guys come in. I understand that because he is a chronic user THC could be detected in his urine for up to a month. The problem with that is, how will I know if he’s still getting high during that first month? I’ve read that the NarcoCheck saliva test can detect use within the last 4-6 hours. But that still leaves some pretty big holes. Any suggestions on how to stagger these test to reduce these holes or suggestions on other tests? 

Just a side note. I have done drugs. I believe most drug use should be legal. I couldn’t care less if other people do drugs. The reason that I have to be absolutely certain that he is drug free in my home, is because I have small children now. Having drugs in my home or having a member of my household arrested for drugs absolutely puts my children at risk, which I will not have.

He was more experienced with drugs and we had amazing memories tripping/rollin balls, smokin all day long and just being homies. 

He guided me through my first roll which was absolutely unforgettable. I did acid for the first time with him on my birthday (did nbome thinking it was acid prior). He also taught me all about weed and how use bongs, dab rigs etc. He also guided me through my first rave where i rolled my tits off and this event killed my social anxiety and brought back so much hope in my life. 

My greatest memory of him would probably be when we were candyflipping, smoking weed, doing nitrous and k. I had a really intense spiritual awakening which just put things into perspective and changed my life for the better. 

Im gonna miss him so fucking much, ive only lived with this guy for 8 ish months but i feel like ive known him for so much longer. It sucks even more that i have to find a new roommate now which is somewhat complicated since everyone isnt that accepting towards drug use. 

He’s had such a positive impact in my life and im fucking devastated that we have to part ways. I got baked asf last night and just cried when i was listening to a trance track that he told me about since it just brought back so many memories.

I’m pretty ashamed to be making this post but really need some reassurance

Im struggling to parent my three sons as their triplets who always side with each other, I know for a fact that they use drugs. I’ve smelt cannabis and suspected my sons are stoned. I’ve found messages which detail xtc, I’m very worried about this as it’s neuro toxic and very bad for teenagers (I’m not trying to insult any drug users and my information may be of, it’s just what I’ve read and I’m all for legalising drugs) and I have also found a bag containing Valium and some unknown pills, possibly opiates of some kind. I also found messages of someone offering blue magic ? And I found a photo on one of their phones of all three of them with their eyes pupils looking very big and I believe they had taken shrooms but I don’t know for sure 

I just want to know their safe while I try and figure out how to prevent further drug use, are the media’s reports of MDMA being cut with harmful stuff overblown ? How do I know they are on valium ? Is it subtle ? How good can you get at hiding being high ? Are my kids in immediate danger ? How can I tell if their high ? Thats my biggest question 

Sorry if this is the wrong sub to post this, tell me and I can see if there’s a way to take it down. I’m embarrassed that I’m doing this but really I some insight as I’m worried

addictive drug known to mankind, and in my opinion, is not worth trying nor getting addicted to in the slightest. If you have yet to ever try it, I don’t see why you ever would, but do yourself a favor and steer clear from it.

**Rant:**

Nicotine is such a pointless drug in my opinion. Sure it can give you a fire buzz and do a pretty damn good job at relieving stress or agitation, but compared to pretty much any other drug in terms of experience (besides deliriants or something like that), it’s straight up dog shit.

In other words, take drugs like Adderall or MDMA for example, which will make your dopamine receptors cum fire, whereas nicotine will give them a slight tickle at most (even with little to no tolerance) in comparison.

And that’s just scratching the surface. I could go on and on about just how addictive it truly is as well as how cigarettes, literally, slowly kill you. (And sure, there are vapes which are considered to be a significantly safer alternative, but we don’t even know just how much safer they truly are, or if they are even safer at all! Because as far as I’m aware, we just don’t know that for sure yet.)

Bottom line, nicotine is in no way, shape or form worth getting addicted to. We only smoke/vape it because our brains physically crave it, as well as to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and if you are lucky enough to have yet to ingest nicotine, please do not do it; I’m telling you right now, if you’re thinking about giving it a try, you might as well just give something like weed a try instead, or pretty much anything else at all for that matter (unless it’s something incredibly if not even more physically dangerous and/or addictive such as meth, heroin, desomorphine, etc).

Also, just to clarify, I know this entire concept is really not this deep. I just have nothing else to do and thought I would express my shame for being addicted to nicotine, and hopefully discourage anyone from ever trying it in the process.

Let me start this post by prefacing that I do not do DXM recreationally and never intend to this was purely by accident. It all started Tuesday night when I had a cough. I looked through our medicine cabinet and found Delsym. I should have known better to check what my antidepressants counteract with beforehand but I had a cough that I couldn’t get rid of and I needed to get to sleep. I did not measure how much Delsym to take in the provided measuring cup and just took a big swig of it similarly to what I do with NyQuil whenever I have a cold. I have never had an adverse reaction before so I thought that would be fine. I went to bed after this and woke up about an hour and a half later with the worst stomach pain I have ever felt in my  life and my vision was completely blurry and distorted. I was seeing double and the room was spinning so fast that I almost passed out multiple times on my way to the bathroom to throw up because of how nauseous I was. I was on the floor crawling because I could not walk, I was terrified. My legs felt like they didn’t work and we’re so heavy and numb. After throwing up twice I decided that I will try to go back to sleep. This did not work because it felt like I was on a boat in the middle of space. I slept about an hour that night and called out of work for the next two days. I took the Delsym on Tuesday and today Friday I am now just able to walk around the house and finally eat again. Wednesday and Thursday were the worst days of my life and I was so nauseous I could not keep anything down it felt like I was drunk for a solid 48+ hours. After the second day in my vision is still blurry I have contemplated going to the ER because of how sick i felt. Prior to this I had no knowledge that you could get high off of Delsym or other DXM products but I sure as hell do now. Lesson learned do not take cough suppressant while on SSRIs. Anyone who is on SSRIs please be extremely careful with this stuff. I believe I was experiencing what is known as serotonin syndrome.

Some of you might know me; I like to do my best to contribute though, like most, have realized the things I thought I knew best were, in fact, unknown. 

I streamed my twenty gram trip but YouTube was quick to delete it. Many of you asked for a trip report and I promised one. As the weeks turned months I found it increasingly difficult to put what I experienced into words.

So many times before have I said something but realized later was wrong. I can’t pretend to be a psychologist that understands how the exact neurochemistry works. So, the approach I would typically use, one I was taught in school, became useless.

[This link](https://youtu.be/SS_mzUrwo64) is the best I can do to describe to you what 20 grams of mushrooms is like.

About 4 years ago, I was employed with good insurance.  One really bad drinking night, bad shit happened, I checked myself in a rehab,  live in 30 days.

It helped I was sober for a time, but relapsed, then sober, kinda back and forth. 

Well anyhow for the first time about 8 months ago, I got involved with a young girl, and she got me into smoking crack.  At first, It was fun. I spent too much, but enjoyed getting high with her.

It became a problem. I'd gonon a binge and smoke until broke. And then try to find things I could sell.

Well. I would love to check into a rehab right now. But I no longer have insurance. I'm blowing my rent money and falling behind. 

My mother doesn't know yet. But I owe her some money. She knows I had a good amount and it's all gone. I cant tell her the truth. But maybe I can go to a hospital, for possible overdose and withdrawal,  and also for mental issues?

Anyway, last night a friend was taking ghb. He's normally a safe user of ghb always taking low doses and never venturing into the realm of dangerous doses.

This was a different story. He pushes the envelope last night and has about 20 ml in the span of 2 hours. He finds a baggie with what he thinks was cocaine but was caffeine and snorts it, ends up having an allergic reaction and feeling like death as he put it, so he counteracted it with ghb to feel better.

I said to him I think he might be experience psychosis just by the way he was talking to me, it sounded like an experience that I had when I accidentally used an ejuice disguised as THC juice when it was synthetic weed for months and end up in a ward with psychosis. Was no fun but the behaviour was too familiar. 

Against my advice, which he usually listens to, he decides to snort the rest of it despite the adverse results. Well as soon as he does it I ask how he feels and all of a sudden he disappears for hours. I thought he was just being an asshole ignoring me and thought he must be fine, despite stills expressing concern.

I was so worried I kept calling him to make sure he was okay. He just disappears off the face of the earth and doesn't respond to anything I would perpetually.message him are you okay, I'm going to call the ambulance on you in twenty minutes if you don't respond etc. Well before that happened he left me on read... So I got pissed that he wouldn't reply to me because he had me so stressed out.

Well turns out he had a psychotic episode in his house going absolutely ballistic and then his heart fails and stops working. Fortunately for the psychosis his family was with him unsure about what was going on but we're with him when he collapsed and dropped dead essentially

They called an ambulance on him, don't know what they did cause it's only been an hour since it happened but they revived him. The family called police and had his ghb and all his money confiscated.

Then he sends me Snapchat videos of his mum interrogating him, being a good caring mother understandably worried asking him to come clean about his drug use. He remained stuck up and continually said he doesn't take anything, despite his pharmacist dad finding all the ghb (well 14b, so it's natural state is frozen at room temperature so it's obvious to a pharmacist) of 2 litres, a second time once before finding 8 litres and pouring it down the sink and never speaking a word about it

Thought I would share this story instantly. I've always felt invincible on drugs, done some dangerous combinations and feel immune to any fatal combinations. But this has changed my mindset completely. Drugs are dangerous especially mixing combinations in excess.

The thing is you need to take enough to dissociate decently hard. People usually don’t want to do that. I’ve figured out that those 20-90 minutes where (if you’ve done a large dose) you dissociate are actually the come up of the drug, in the same way when you take acid there’s 30-90 minutes of that confusing/uncomfortable period around 3-4 hours after you take the acid. Same goes for ketamine it just happens quicker. Once you get through the other side of that dissociation of a large dose, the high from the ketamine will lasts you a significant amount of time, and it’s be very physically psychedelic. 

To anyone who hasn’t don’t DMT the way I describe it is like K holing on LSD. DMT has the physical psychedelic element as well as mental visual/auditory etc..

(My first time trying it, BF has tried before a long time ago) 

We just had one line each to start tonight off.. we haven’t drunk haven’t smoked, have eaten less today that we normally would so have emptier stomachs, and after about half an hour I threw up. My BF then felt sick too and has been sick (partially influenced by the smell of my sick lol) 

We were really up for a fun night listening to music and bumping more for a few hours, but we’re not sure what to do now as we feel sick/have been sick.

Should we eat more and have a settled full stomach? Should i stick to still rather than fizzy drinks? Should we just stop completely and call it a fail. Any tips or advice? Any thoughts about smoking some weed?

I was in highschool and would smoke weed from time to time. I started a new job that would periodically test employees. I  hung around allot of people that smoked marijuana and it was hard not to join in.
  My girlfriend at the time had me go to her girlfriends house to hang out. They were smoking like crazy and I was about to leave when the girlfriend offered me some spice. Had no clue what the hell it was but it looked like really crappy weed. 
  I rolled up a splif and zoned out on the couch. Everything got wavy. Any random sound was funnier than the last. I sat there for what felt like 10 minutes staring at them in bed when it was actually about 2 hours. 
  I enjoyed the feeling. I found a smoke shop in the middle of town, next to towns grocery store, that sold a few different types of spice . I would buy a silver bag  with hazard label called platinum. I knew that I could smoke a splif  2 miles from the house , park and get inside before tripping. 
  My buddy and I went to go pick some up and all he had left was Scooby snacks which came in a tie-dye holographic package with bubbles and Scooby's face on it. We rolled a splif and drove to his cousins house. 
  When I got 2 miles from the house I lit it took a drag and had to pull over. It felt like the world paused and slowly drifted to the side. I started to feel sick so I got out of my car and grabbed my push bar. I threw up all over my cruiser and felt like I was lifting it in the air but really was sliding under it. 
 He was doing fine and called his cousin to bring me water. I remember his 14 year old cousin having to drive my cruiser to his house while I was locked in back seat.
 I blacked out from there but remember seeing a the cake from portal floating in a dark room with white neon behind it. I went to pick it up and came to on the couch with a piece of double chocolate cake in my hand. 
 After this I stopped k2 but kept the pack and ended up having another trip that actually sent me to the hospital and kicked out of college, but that's a story for a different day.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,696428,public,confidence,self,Reliving k2.

My ex a long time ago was really abusive. I used to be a pretty big pot head when I was younger, I’m sober now. Anyways, there was a time when I decided to leave him. He started to get really physical with me and super crazy. He beat the shit out of me, and this was after we took shrooms so I was already pretty delicate, I was also 18 and he was like 35. Pretty fucking awful but I was in LA modeling and it just seemed normal there. Anyways, he had  had problems in the past with crack. I had no clue about it. 

Well, when he beat me up he started getting really paranoid telling me I couldn’t call the cops bc people would kill him and me. When I smoked our weed I started feeling and hallucinating voices and seeing things I had never done before. It was really terrifying. He actually was a Scientologist and did some really fucked up shit while I was smoking like interrogating me about past life’s and my life and it was just really scary. I like ran out of my apartment literally in my underwater and shirt I felt like I was in a horror movie. 

Anyways. I ended up being put in a mental hospital for like two months. Weed never did that to me. And like ever since that time I have horrible ptsd. Um, he ended up making up stories to my parents that I was smoking crack with a bunch of actors which was hilarious bc I had no friends in LA and had never even smoked crack so that was his addiction. I think he laced the weed with it. He also kept having me drink out of this water bottle that could have been drugged. I just don’t know what happened to me. I personally think he was the one smoking crack and then drugged me. 

If anyone has any feedback on this I’d really appreciate it because I can’t find information online and I really want to get over my past. It would really help my ptsd. This dude was and is a shit bag in my opinion and I just want to move on. Thanks ahead of time. Also this was in 2009. I didn’t sleep for days and I ended up 89 lbs.

I’ve just been reading through Erowid and remembered some issues I had with some cannabis resin probably 2002 or 2003ish, wondered if anyone had any ideas or similar experiences as to what went on.

Bear in mind that in 2002 I was 21 years old and smoking different forms of weed non stop from morning until night so had a massive tolerance and was familiar with its effects.

Me and a friend purchased a nine ounce brick of cannabis resin, we’d been doing the same thing every 7-10 days for day smoking to offset the high cost of green at the time. 

At some point during this bar I made myself a bucket bong and had a go. I’d usually have a day a week on just bongs so knew what to expect. I immediately felt extremely tired, more so than usual, and according to my friend ran outside and fast matched up and down the street for a whole hour. He said that my eyes were glazed and even if he put his body weight in front of me I kept moving my legs without going forward. According to him after about an hour of laughing at me he got me back in the house where I had what seemed to be a seizure and then came round, back to being a nice level of stoned. I can remember coming round and being confused but nothing of the previous hour. I put it down to being higher than usual. 

A few days later I was smoking this same weed and had what I’d describe as a mini seizure. I bent down to pick up a lighter and suddenly couldn’t move but my eyes rolled back and I started shaking. This happened a couple more times throughout the day before I refused to smoke anymore of that resin. I’ve never had anything similar happen before or since.

I’m not a believer in dealers putting expensive drugs in their product but I do know that at the time some vile household products were being put in resin.

Out of interest, does anyone have any thoughts? What would cause this? Would clear up a minor mystery for me.

We parked at a private lot next to a fully loaded limo van, the ones with the TV and lazy boys. As I was taking the bags out of the trunk I noticed a dime bag  on the step of the van. 
   I only smoke weed and want to do shrooms, however don't feel like I'm in the right mindset in life for that adventure. I have always been against lsd, coke, pills , or anything else just because I have trust issues against man made drugs. The public school ads pop into mind on how they could be cut with rat poison and liquid dish soap  and you never know really what's inside them.
    I walked the family member to the airport, said goodbye and all that BS. I decided on the way back that since I've got nothing better to do because of quarantine, I would pick up the bag and see what it is.
   It was a white powder with little crystals in it. After searching Reddit for an hour, looking up ways to test it and tell by smell and so on. I was certain it was coke. I've seen people do coke before and decided to just do a bump since I had no clue of there was fentanyl or anything else in it . 
   I cut a straw put it up my nose , poured a bump into the corner of my hand and took a snort. It felt like someone shoved a spike of acid and energy into the bridge of my nose. When I took the straw out there was a little bit of blood on it, back to Reddit i went and saw that was normal. My whole face started numbing but I felt amazing.
  i had been awake for some time now and was pretty tired. After the coke I felt like I just woke up from a very long nap and chugged a red bull. I wasn't wired but felt more awake than I have in awhile. I felt taller . By this point the back of my throat and mouth started to numb. I wasn't digging the feeling and decided to go smoke a blunt.
   Since I lost my business 2 years ago I have been smoking marijuana. I used to go through .5 gram pen every 2-3 weeks to now going through a quarter of bud, gram pen, and an 1/8 of pre-rolls in a week.  I was getting tired of blowing 200+ a week but whenever I tired to quit        I would become an ***hole, and past injury would act up. I would also get super depressed and extreme anxiety. 
 After the coke I called and talked to my wife and she said I sounded like I did when we first met. I haven't felt the need to smoke since and everyone around me is asking what I did to change overnight. 
  Really don't think I'm going to tell them it's because of cocaine I found on the ground.

So I did exactly that, and on the day of the exam, my dumbass thought it would be great to shoot a lot of lines and drink like 3 cans of red bull like 2 hours before the exam so that it would help me to concentrate more. 

Little did I fucking know, it was gonna be a nightmare. I walked in and every one could tell I was stoned as hell. I felt like i wasnt even walking, was so paranoid and was just hallucinating random shit. 

It was a 3 hour exam and I knew every single answer to the questions. But the words were like moving everywhere, my hands were trembling so much, the whole paper was soaking wet because of the sweat and I was having a massive headache and honestly felt like I was sleeping. The worst part is,i knew every answer in my head but it was so hard to put it on paper, it took so long to just write a letter. Felt like I had forgotten how to write. And In the whole 3 hours i was only able to like attend 3 questions when i had 40 questions left. Tbh my eyes were closed, i thought I was asleep,and my hands were just writing and I doubt it was even english and I highly doubt if it was related to psychology


The only good thing was,they gave me a lot of extra time coz I'm on the spectrum and I have a few learning deficits. So,I took 6 hours in total. I still couldn't finish the paper, it was a total nightmare and the examiner was so done and so tired lmao. I knew I would fail and I was prepared for it coz after that I researched a lot about repeating the year or writing it again blah blah blah.


To my surprise, I got my result last week. And fuxking hell, I got 90 out of 100. Now I usually dont like telling my results but for the first time I believe in miracles. I was honestly expecting a 19 or a 20 but like 90, in my bloody dreams. Till this day idek what I wrote. ik 90 isn't that amazing either but for the first time I feel proud of myself. Ok not all proud, the meth and the red bull was something that I just never wanna combine or repeat again on any of my exams. But idk. I mean I guess the examiner was blind, I just dont get it. A part of me wants to receive my answer sheet and read what I wrote coz I'm high key suspicious but like whatever. I'm happy. 

Anyway ik I'm a dumb ass but like please dont do a lot of meth during ur exams and plis do not combine it with tons of red bull. Anyway nobody asked for this dumb experience that my dumbass caused myself but I just felt like posting it u know idek. Probably coz I'm just a wee bit high now. But anyways,....

So I wanted to ask here because most of the information I've found on reddit or other forums seems basically contradictory. Essentially I hear two sides:

&amp;#x200B;

People who have gotten away with bringing their dab carts on a cruise have said its very easy, mixed with pens or cosmetics, it blends right in, there's not really dogs, and if they are there are they are almost always bomb dogs. (dogs can only be trained to smell drugs or bombs not both). but then there's the other people who say that if you get caught its not worth it, you'll probably be seen as a drug smuggler, taking to customs and charged with federal drug smuggling (Yeah I would really not want that to happen)

&amp;#x200B;

So this is basically my plan and im not sure if it would work or not, I wanted to get one of these activated carbon liner bookbags, put my laptop in it when I board, maybe some clothes and either a pen bag or cosmetic bag to put the cart in, but also have that bag inside of the somewhat smell-proof bookbag be one of those nice smell proof or even another carbon activated bag pouch by the same company that would make one of the book bags. Have my clothes or whatever else stacked up and put the cosmetic/pen bag (with the cart) at the very top of the bookbag. as I researched that dogs typically can only sniff a certain height above the ground, if I pull the straps tight, have the bag rest high on my back, I think that will defuse a little bit how low the smell cone reaches to the ground. I think this would be the most optimal plan.

However I'm stuck with a dilemma, If they just so happened to have a drug sniffing dog boarding passengers, would that mean I'm basically screwed? because I don't think there's anyway I can 100% guarantee that the smell will  not leak out of its containing bags, and alert a dog? Do I try getting it off my person at the point if I happen to see one? would that be suspicious? or do I just hope that by luck the dog doesn't go off and I just walk right through?

So what if additionally I literally just had one cart? Can I plead with customs like ""cmon its not like I wanted to make anymore or sell drugs or smuggle a shit ton of weight I just wanted to sleep I just got one cart man not too big of a deal""?

Idk just kinda stuck on my decision I just want to be 100% certain either way that I should or shouldn't bring a cart on. So even if you are 100% convince by no means I should bring it lemme know two I just want to be certain and not regret my decision, it would suck to decide not to then see people have carts on the cruise :/

At first I was pretty chill.

Vibed and listened to some music, chilling. Music sounded that much more intense on the come up.

No visuals.

Went for a walk, feeling a bit nervous. Feel like something is coming and bracing for impact, get very hot - some water was good for me though, cooled down and all was fine. Sense of hearing was heightened, everything was heightened. 

Could hear a delivery drivers little hand thing beep, my shoes touching the floor, the birds in the sky, etc etc. Overwhelming but in a good way.

Due to seperate issues, I've been drinking a lot of water to stay hydrated. Nothing at all serious, just over the counter medication 

I hope to be off soon. I think maybe drinking a fair bit of water dulled my 2cb experience. The crazy visuals I expected did not come.

I closed my eyes laying down however, and seen a face? Might have been tripping myself out thinking I high, pussied out and opened my eyes.

6 friends of mine were tripping on relatively heavy stamps  and I decided to trip set them. 

Initially everything was fine, but 3 hours in the trip one of my friends got a seizure while standing. 
As soon as we saw her fall down and saw her get an epileptic attack we went to help her out. 

But as soon as we approached her she started screaming 'LEAVE ME' in a voice which was unlike hers. I went to hold her head but as soon as I got near she had a vicious expression full of loathing on her face. 

It was as if their something inside of her. She started twisting  her body and crawling on the street and was screaming incomprehensible things.

She was convulsing and crawling on the street for a few minutes. My friends who were tripping got scarred the shit out of them. Like they couldn't even look at her. 

Even I stood helplessly for a minute just watching her. But I couldn't take it anymore, because she could have easily injured her head or other body parts. 

 I just rushed towards without looking at her face, just hugged her to the ground to stop her movements. Then I shook her head and kept calling her namee. 

And I could see it in her eyes, when she was coming back to normal. She was very disoriented and still murmuring incompressible things, but she wasnt convulsing and had calmed down. 

We literally had to pick her up and take her to the nearest friends placee. After a while she regained consciousness and we gave her waterr. 

We asked her what had happened and she just told us that shee wass peakinggg reallly bad on the stamp , felt dehydrated and was out of breath while walking after that she completely blacked out.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,696369,public,confidence,self,Seizure on Acid which led to excited catatonia,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hwzjya/seizure_on_acid_which_led_to_excited_catatonia/,no_ads,0.0,1595616205.0,450b9864-9d47-11e5-bb1d-0ef44579b8c1,Psychedelics,,Psychedelics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What made me even more skeptical was intagram. She was known by a nickname in my school, she’s got let’s just say over 10k followers

All of the pics are sexually derived, wether it be outfits, the positions, ect.

When I google that name that’s all I see on google images. 

I didn’t keep in touch after I broke up, but my life has gotten even worse since before, and I’ve been through a shit load. She messaged me a couple days ago saying she basically wanted to get back together

Apparently she left social media for awhile, she deleted all her pictures and added me on a new snap.

I’ve always done copious amounts of drugs, but when we were together I wouldn’t tell her, and whenever I even brought a cart (thc vape) she didn’t like it and would take it away. I used to have some self respect, but nowadays I hate life so much, that I don’t even care if it’ll be a toxic relationship. Atleast someone shows affection for me. 

I used to doubt why she wanted me when we were dating, of all the people she could get, I don’t have money, and I hate everything about myself so I’ve got no clue. But it’s been almost exactly a year, and she not only seems to have changed, but still wants me. I do so many more drugs now and hate life so much it’s not even funny. I haven’t told her I never graduated high school, and all I want to do is rap, yet whenever I do I hate listening to myself. I hate everything there is to hate about myself.

Even if she’s difunctional and I have to deal with weird shit again, I may as well make it work. Might be one thing stopping me from attempting suicide again, or absolutely nothing that lasts a week. I got problems too, I’m not gonna find any perfect girl

I was leaving my buddies house, who lived across the street from me. As I was walking across the street, I noticed two guys and a man laying on the ground. My first thought was they were fighting or possibly robbing this guy *I used to live in Philadelphia, so this isn't out of the blue*

I walk over because they are basically right infront of my apartment and I noticed immediately the man on the ground was gushing blood from his head. He was hit by a drunk driver leaving one of the local bars.

The two men who were standing up *my god these two were fucking morons* were telling him to move and also trying to physically move him. I stopped both men, told them to shut up and let me handle this. I called 911 while I was talking to the man. I kept asking him simple questions ""What is your name, what year is it, who is the president"" just to keep him awake


Fast forward about 10 minutes, police show up and they are asking me questions * while I'm freaking high as fuck on blow* I'm 99.99% sure the police knew I was fucked up, but they were more concerned with the man on the ground. Ambulance comes, they take him away and I go into my apartment trying to fall asleep after one of the most fucked up nights of my life. 

The next day I get a FB message from a reporter asking to interview me *because I belonged to the local FB group and was desperately trying to find the driver who did this*

Here is the interview with the local news for clarity.

Here's a non-detailed, non-specific recount: 

Had a good friend, did lots of dissociatives together. I told him about LSD and how it changed my life. Never had a chance to trip with him though. 

A few months later, he's already tripped a few times without me. He's about to move in to my apartment, lease signing next week. He's about to spend his first night in his new place. 

I smoke a joint and go to bed before Friday's workday, while he celebrates his birthday doing acid with his girlfriend. 

I wake up at 2 am with his giant figure slicing at me with a kitchen knife. I escape to bathroom, he breaks through the door like a bull. I feign passing out so he leaves me alone. 

I manage to get to the door when cops come knocking, his gf having fled the apartment to give the alert. They were on their way anyhow, given the door slamming at 2 am. I welcome them half-naked, bleeding from head to toes. 

I didn't press charges, so he got released a couple months later. Says he thought he had to kill me to save the world. 

Acid can be dangerous. It has changed my life for the best, and I still ceremoniously trip every couple years, but I can't recommend it as light-heartedly as I used to.

But im still getting high then my hearing goes quieter and everything starts to go the tiniest bit blurry and it starts to intensify and a few minutes later im only just being able to make things out and my eyes were wide open and nothing was working it got to a point where my vision was completely gone all i could see was black as if i had my eyes shut, the worst part about it was I was in the middle of the woods so i couldn't just go sleep it off
So i put my hands in my head and just rest for a few minutes and then i look up and everything is still blurry but im starting to be able to see so i do the same again and just rest for a while and maybe 10 minutes later I didnt really have a  perception of time but I could see again and i was back to normal
So i have a another drink and I start to feel it again,
My vision was going blurry so without a second thought I close my eyes and rest again and contemplate why the fuck this is happening to me.
So I looked again and i still couldn't see and then BANG I could see perfectly all of a sudden and felt completely sober while 2 minutes ago I was a extremely high blind swetty mess!

So at this point i was confused on what just happened to me and im the only person that can roll a joint so i roll them a joint and think im just gonna pass on it and not smoke anymore, so i give it to them and just take some time to chill and then the  joint gets offered to me and I turn it down then think im completely sober now so i say never mind i will have a few tokes and i was completely fine and a little while goes on and some more people came and smoked another and nothing happend to me that was concerning after that.

It happens with almost drug I take, and it happens too damn fast. 
I lose the euphoric feeling too fast from anything. Opiates and similar, uppers, Benzos,  even cannabis, with the exception of Kratom, given I switch ""strains"" and vendors every few days. It started after high school when I got Into hydrocodone. It would last a good 4 hours at first, then it slowly started to lose it's magic, of course. But then I started doing OxyContin did that a lil while, fucked with Xanax and alcohol a lot then started messing with uppers, which I overdid it with methylphenidate patches (I know stupid, but I was 19) and ended up having a very bad time and had some delusions, once those died down I had a hard time with anxiety and drank quite a bit 1.75 in 24 hour period I also know, stupid. 
 I don't know if any of that is super relevant to my question, but like I literally can't take hydrocodone for pain even, it won't work. Ritalin works but the euphoria leave FAST. Like I said about kratom, it works for me, I just need to only take twice a day and switch my stash up every couple/few days. 
 With bud, i also have to switch, depending on strength of the thc/CBD. I just would like to know why i lose my magic with basically ever drug my body has ever done, no matter how long or much I took. I have to take drugs that have some kind of ER to it. Doesn't matter if its speed based opiate-based or cannabis. It's truly irritating, i have cut down on drugs and the only thing i take daily is kratom. It works wonders for my anxiety, but it's the only drug I don't lose euphoria one or two times after i take it. Drugs arent supposed to lose their magic within one or two days of use.

However, I am going to tell about a few strange/unexplainable things directly related to the recording itself in the comment section of this post. Now, here is the essay and the short verse which somewhat serves as an introduction to it:

*i hide myself in the shadows 

my “i” shines through the darkness and the flourishing of the shadows which i produce and surround myself with; 

which surround me with themselves, unbeknownst to me 

bright shadows

bright shadows 

the Oneness, or the multidimensiality of the fractal sets, the so-called “hivemind” of bits of consciousness that exist in every existing particle of the material world, all of them interconnected no matter the distance. But I’m repeating myself here. I wasn’t sure if I should write out these thoughts or not, but I concluded that verbalising my experience would be more worthy than keep it all to myself. 

Am I Empty? Or am I a Universe containted within itself? Or is it that the whole Universe, in itself, is Empty? 

I take pride in my works of art, I think they give me value as a person. But why should I engage my thinking in these “market economics” concepts of “value” as applied to myself? 
So if I get rid of all things that make me proud of myself, of all things that feed my ego, of all things that I consider to be particles of the grandiose collage that I have determined as “myself”, who do I become then? What is left when all is gone? What remains when nothing else does? 

Some would consider this question to be unreasonable, as it is built on a paradox. But aren’t all concepts directly related to what we call “life” and “consciousness” are, at their core, built on dichotomies and the paradoxes that those dichotomies create? Why is it that all human logic can be reduced to a dichotomy? Essentially, one or zero? Perhaps that’s one for the proponents of the Simulation theory. 

But if you go beyond all dichotomies in which human logic, consciously or subconsciously, operates — what remains then? Is there a God? Who am I addressing all these questions to? 

If there is a God, I will appear before him stripped of what I can “myself” entirely, to nullify and dissolve with Him, essentially becoming Nothing. But what created us if we all came from nothing? Who am I addressing all these questions to? 

By writing this out, I already accept that it will become seen by somebody other than me, because that’s what my ego dictates. At the same time, it is, quite paradoxically considering the subject matter, a very personal writing. Perhaps, by marking it out clearly as my Weakness, I can nullify what I consider to be my “Weakness”. Perhaps, none of the written above even makes any sense, or appears to be too arrogant, since those who read this may already know all the things that I have talked about. What have I talked about?

*I don't condone the use of drugs, in fact it would be safer if you didn't take them. This post is simply for HARM REDUCTION purposes.*

So the story w/ klonopin and marijuana is pretty short and sweet. 

I'm perscribed Klonopin (benzodiazapine) and I take 3mg daily but I just thought I'd let you guys know that there's really nothing special about kpins. 

The duration of the high from 1mg(kpin) is longer than 1mg of a Xanax. And benzodiazepines by themselves are kinda boring. You just get chatty if you have anxiety because it removes your anxiety and then you get sedated on the come down. 

It's fun w/ marijuana because I become insanely focused on the peak and it's really good for gaming or even working out if you take the right dose. 

But yeah all in all it's a pretty boring drug and can lead to addiction easily so it's best to stay away from it and other benzos unless you need them.

I had dealt with bad anxiety and depression and trauma from life long illnesses and abuse. Today was my first time micro-dosing or even taking magic mushrooms or any psychedelic. I cannot begin to tell you how amazing the experience was. I felt my anxiety, depression, and sadness melt away completely. I was with friends and I wanted to explore outside and find trails and find nature, and we did. It was an amazing experience, total bliss. This is very different from my usual self (too anxious to leave the car) and agoraphobic and pessimistic and in a fog of thoughts. Even 7 hours after my experience I still feel the benefits from the microdose and it’s unbelievable. I read online about psilocybin and people being treated with it who have very bad mental health. The readings indicate that mushrooms can help these people tremendously and maybe that is what I experienced? I gave up weed due to CHS and almost dying in the ER from vomiting, dehydration, kidney problems, and electrolyte deficiencies. It’s very rare though. I felt my want to smoke completely go away.

We are continuously trying to improve functionalities, user interactions, reducing the level of difficulty to get used to the App. I would love some perspectives on what everybody thinks I could pass on to the Dev. Team to improve?**

The App currently features mood trackers, nutrition planners, symptom trackers and a connection with a Care-Team.

**This includes being able to do the following:** 

* Add Caregiver information for future reference
* Enable pill alerts for missed doses
* Enable Caregivers to view your care plans, reports &amp; bookmarks. Share symptom reports from your medicine tracker directly
* Nudge Dependents to stay on track

One of the core features is a Medication Reminder, meaning that patients are able to add their medication and set reminders through the App.

**The functionalities are as follows**: 

* Set pill reminders, appointments, refill reminders, vitamin reminders or supplement trackers
* Snooze medication reminders or Mark as Taken
* See medication adherence reports from pill tracking
* Medicine Reminders can be adjusted to new timezones
* Keep track of Health Appointments for yourself and family

There is a diary and symptom tracker function that can be used in unison for patients to monitor their well-being.

**The functionalities include the following:** 

* Check-in to record your treatment alongside medication reminders
* Include PRN, Photos, Weight, Sleep, Blood Pressure, Energy, Memory, Mood, Pain Log, Blood Pressure, Pulse &amp; Temperature or Add your own Measurement &amp; Goals.
* Log Therapies: Meditation, Mindfulness, CBT, LLLT, Fitness

This post is lowkey trash but I recommend reading my quotes from psychosis, they’re italicized down there. Funny shit. Last three paragraphs are cool too :P

Ever since drugs entered my life, they have made me a better person. They have made me kinder, more compassionate, more understanding, more loving of life, and accepting of others. Almost every drug I have done has taught me something important. I am sure I’ll share with these with the community later. But today, we’re talking about my two experiences with Adderall. 

Now, I don’t have adhd or anything like that, at least I don’t think. But fuck man am I depressed and have huge issues with motivation. I am a fool that is for certain but I’m not stupid. I know what it takes to get myself out of this rut in life but its so fucking difficult. I wish I could reset the pattern my brain has gotten itself into. To stop putting the important things off and seeking pleasure instead. But I don’t. I just don’t. I know I should. It’s logical, it’s reasonable, it’s NESSECARY. But nah I would rather eat some dope food and play some kick ass games. The worst part is when I face a serious failure in life, it hurts my soul, I cry, and swear to change. But I never do. 

The last time I faced one of those episodes was a few months ago. The last week of my second semester of college(a blast this whole college thing is no cap). Classes had not been face to face for several weeks due to corona. Not that I was going to too many classes anyway but once shit went online, I didn’t log on to canvas for fucking weeks. Just vibed, smoked hella weed almost every day and just had a good ass time with my bros. Of course, this would come to bite me. I kept letting all my work pile up and up. Until I had a damn mountain of shit to do. Nothing new to me though, Ever since the latter years of high school I had gotten accustomed to putting things off, back then to play cs:go or some Minecraft lmao. Great games. Then the day before assignments were due I would blast some Eurobeat and get to grinding. 

This ridiculous habit followed me into adulthood. This time it was different though. This time serious financial investment was on the line and could possibly fuck up my life if I failed all my classes like I was on the verge of doing. However…. This time I had a secret weapon that a year prior would seem ludicrous to me. Drugs! I had tried Ritalin but found it to not affect me too much. Adderall was what I was looking for it for a while and I found it just in time. A week or two before finals. I could procrastinate even more knowing I had the secret weapon to fuck this mountain of work up. Oh boy did I overestimate their potential. 

I bought like 7 15mg xr and planned on doing half a semester of work in a few days. When it was time to rock and fucking roll I popped two of those boys and started with my favorite class: Philosophy, Politics, and Economics(yes one class, not to flex if you’re interpreting it that way just clarifying lmao. Man, I’m fucking silly lol). I began reading the works of Karl Marx, and Cohen. Exploring communism. Fuck was I INVESTED in what I was reading. It was incredible. I was glued to my computer, taking awesome notes that connected all the main ideas into a coherent framework that I could use to clearly and effectively answer the prompts I was also given. I was having an absolute blast. After I finish with the Communist and Counter Communist literature, I decide I’m going to smoke some dabs because why not. 

What awaited me next was absolute euphoria. The Adderall gave me SUPER LUNGS that allowed me to take the biggest hits I have ever, and to date, taken in my life. I am almost certain that night I smoked more thc/dabs than I ever had in one sitting. Dab after dab. Keep em coming. Pure bodily euphoria. But that wasn’t even the best part. The best part was I was learning. I was learning so much. Taking in so many new perspectives and seeing the world in new lights. The bourgeoisie gained their wealth and power through capitalism, and through their seemingly unstoppable expansion of influence, managed to dismantle the feudal system. Marx believed that the proletariat must follow in the steps of the bourgeoisie and overthrow them the way they overthrew their feudal lords. I can say in retrospect it is a super cool idea with lots of truth to it but I’m not sure if it’s entirely true. But fuck was that mind blowing. Every piece of literature had dense mind-blowing information in it. Even Martha Nussbaum making an argument for legalizing prostitution(something about giving women control of their own sexuality’s financially or some shit) introduced brand new perspectives to my head that I would have never even considered before.  

Halfway through that course I notice something. I’m having too much of a good time taking these notes and immersing myself within the literature. Every assignment(piece of literature, and 5 prompts) was taking me two to three hours, and those were hours I could not afford to spend. I was saddened by this realization because the fun would have to be cut back on a little. It felt as if I had been missing out on what a true educational experience really was like. I wanted to take this feeling back with me to sobriety. This idea would ingrain itself in my head until it was all over. So, I stop taking notes trusting that my GODLIKE memory and IQ from this drug would be more than enough to answer the prompts. I was not totally correct as it did take several glances back at the literature. I also redosed a few times this night every 4 or 5 hours. 

I decide to take a quick break. Talk to my roommate for a little. Fuck could I talk and talk and talk and talk and talk. It was so much fun! Just how my studies were so incredibly interesting, everything I said and heard from my roommate was so fucking interesting. But I knew I had to stop, I had not the time to waste. This saddened me a bit as well, but no matter. Onward! Many many hours pass and I am almost done with that class but I know I have to make some intelligent decisions if I want to salvage my overall grades. I stop with what I was doing and decide to take my American Government final which I didn’t study for, barley showed up for class, and definitely barley read anything posted online. To my luck, all the information was stuff I already knew. The exam was easy and I fucked that bitch up in under an hour. A true blessing. I thanked childhood me for being super into history : D, kiddo saved my life. What comes after that? A euphoric shower where I jerk off for half an hour, only to realize a nut is miles away and I’m wasting my *PRECIOUS* time. 

I get out and back on the grind, just to pick my phone up and loose another 20 minutes staring at girls on snap. I just couldn’t get enough, they looked like such sculpted works of Art. Absolute perfection. Wow. That’s all I could say. But fuck, I was running out of time. Only a day and a half left and several classes left to go. I was taking two student success seminars because my dummy ass failed first semester. But fuck one of them wants me to do a fucking project that involves taking all the information we learned over the semester(didn’t learn any of it cause I barley went!), so here I am scrambling through this dummy project trying to put the pieces together just to find out that I need to attach next semester schedule to it? FUCK. I procrastinate everything. Even that. I didn’t even make my schedule until a few weeks ago lmao. So that class was a lost cause but I just accepted it and moved on. 

I open geology and see another mountain of fucking mountains. I’d rather just fail I told myself. As my mind began to tire, I lost motivation to keep going in that moment. I needed to rest for a while. So that is what I do. I go to my bed, and somehow fall asleep for about 5 hours. Maybe the giant amounts of thc(probably a good amount of cbd in the dabs too) in my body were overpowering the amphetamine. Idk. All I know is I slept, woke up, took two more addys and got back on my crusade. At this point I half about a 30 hours left or something. I knew my fate had been set in stone. I explained to my roommate that it felt like I was getting surrounded by 7 zombies, and I had a gun with only 5 bullets. Was I going to go down swinging? Hell yeah. Was I going to go down? Yeah… I have 3 classes left full of work to do. I say fuck it. I’m going to have fucking fun and continue working on my PPE. I work the rest of the day on that, finish all of my addys, continue to take hella dabs and work until the night. I had lost but I was high as fuck and didn’t care. I was literally just vibing. As it became dark, I had only some 8 hours left(grades were due in the morning of the next day or something I think). But, something happened while I was chugging away. 

I went into fucking psychosis. As I was trying to finish my favorite class, I end up typing two pages of nonsense throughout out the night. Philosophical nonsense clearly influenced by the information I was soaking up. I’ll probably post it sometime on its own but here are some quotes:  *“Lmao. Hello all, and self, much love, and best regards to all. Since all of humanity, which makes sense that it is possible for warping of perception and fantasies of man to not only effectively desire, the desire of being filed in*  *or at least a reasonable amount of reasonable and awesome showerthoughts.”* This was the opening line lmao

*“Followed very close to the given how amazing they really are. Besides, by the comibation ogreat on weed crashes It make less sense to those of humanity with little matter regarding just the polar music of Weezers, greatest strengths are true experienced art.”* I guess I was listening to weezer right then lmao, awesome band haha

*“Really to inspect not only my person relationship of maintaining the happies selft, or guest, will more likely bet by relating to my fellow man about what it means to live a fulfilling life”* Damn. Feel like I was really on to something LMAO. Aight one more. 

*“Your child hood, may have been particularly if they were not meerley the seeker or pleasure, or*  *The potential. . . for abuse. . , no matter the differences or nuances of us all. The past two days, and I know not if I shall leave in unshared, and unprofitable producing legacies of particular amounts of fine art I have understood the artistic boost that is clearly boost”* I feel like the first sentence is getting at the themes I talked about in the beginning of this post. I grew up a pleasure seeker, looking for the next dopamine rush. Whether through the vidya games, porn, or shitty food that tastes awesome, rather than doing things that require discipline. The second sentence if I had to guess, and I do, is reflecting on the amphetamine binge I was coming off of then. The artistic boost stuff sounds legit, I definitely could have made some dope art if I had any idea how to do so.  Mind was for sure in artistic boost mood though fr fr.  

I remember sitting down and typing this out. Remember it making more sense in the moment though. I think I thought I was writing in my journal. Well anyway, I was in this state for about the whole night. Some 6-8 hours. Thank god I didn’t fucking submit this. Some other things I felt/experienced while in psychosis. It was like a delirious psychedelic trip. Never had one but I bet that’s what I would feel like. I think(I think), I was aware of being in psychosis but I’m not sure I’m just projecting that into my memories. I definitely remember being chill af. I knew it would be over and I just had to hang on. My entire body felt how a limb that is very asleep feels like. It felt sorta good, but not as godly euphoric as I felt before. At some point I manage to go pee, and it was ODD, my pp felt fucking weird, but I was just vibing. I had a difficult time breathing and was breathing manually the entire night. The only scary thing that happened, or kept happening, was this flag that I can see from the window in front of my desk. I’m not sure if it was moving in the wind, or my mind was imagining it but every time it moved it fucking spooked the shit outta me. Like a jump scare. Well once the sun began to rise, I began to regain most of my normal consciousness, my breathing is still heavy and manual, my body still feels asleep, and it takes me a solid minute at least to stand up out of my chair, but it was a challenge that felt kind of good. The first thing I do is take a fat dab. Instantly after exhaling my breathing returns to normal, and I am back to normal at this point. 

I had failed most of my classes but fuck, that was a battle and I’m a fucking veteran of it. Had a good ass sleep after that. Deserved it. So, what comes after that? (before we get into that lemme tell you I was orange! I looked in the mirror after I woke up and I was orange like Donald trump. I thought that was funny but was sure it would pass. It did. Aside from that I didn’t really feel a comedown or crash post psychosis, I sort of had an afterglow where I was motivated to turn my life around.) What comes after my miserable failure as a person? A fucking fight that’s what. No way is that shit happening again. I start researching motivation issues, focus issues, shit about the brain, stuff about diet because I was tired of living in this shitty body. The next months would consist of research, research, research. But the patterns I had ingrained in my life were like castle walls. Impenetrable without serious gunpowder(metaphorically). I found myself burning out after giving different self-improvement techniques out, going back to seeking pleasure rather than improvement. 

Well, I signed up for a summer economics class to boost my gpa after that giant tank(!corona virus saved me from getting kicked out! : D ) Just to end up running into internet issues that would spiral into procrastination to both fix them, then get to work. So about two weeks into the class and few 0’s. I finally just fucking did it. Got my internet fixed and got to working. However. I had overestimated my sober abilities to focus and work. I had not applied myself in so long that attempting to actually do something was difficult. Reading, analyzing, and problem solving? Borderline painful. So I bought more amphetamine! My second two-day binge is coming to end as I type these very words. But damn, has amphetamine revealed some very important *truths* to me. 

The first is that dopamine is very important chemical for motivation and hard work. My personal theory is that since my whole childhood and adolescence was about doing what was fun and not what was hard, I am used to not having the dopamine to difficult task. If you search “dopamine detox” on youtube you will find some super interesting videos about how dopamine helps us accomplish tasks. Rather than being the “feel good” chemical in the way we think about it, its more of a “feel good enough to motivate you to do a task the brain thinks is worthwhile” chemical. Rather than being released in the face of pleasure, it is released in *anticipation* of a reward. And theoretically(haven’t tried it yet but probably in the next few days) if you starve your brain of typical dopamine releasing activities(browsing social media, playing vidya, nuttin, doing most drugs, watching Netflix, listening to music, etc) for a day or two and your brain will release it while doing activities typically considered, or *experienced*, mundane. Such as reading a book, doing schoolwork or exercising (lots of people feel great while and after they work out but I don’t and can barley do it without hardcore high energy music propping my soul up).

Amphetamine makes doing boring shit easy and exciting because of precisely the same principle. Dopamine! While I highly doubt amphetamine levels of dopamine activity are possible. I’d like to aim for more dopamine, more of the time. At least this will be my first attempt to drastically change the bad habits I have. I really hope, and am going to give it my best shot to pick up the pieces of my broken life and piece it back together in a way that makes me stronger and better than I was before. I shall ***will it*** into existence.

I personally have noticed a lot of positives from tripping every weekend and the only negative I can think of is that I have started to create a bit of a habit.

So, it's around 22:30 and I'm bored as fuck so I decide to take this tab I've had sitting around for a while. I was told it was 220ug but I didn't test it so I don't know how accurate that is. Now I'm fairly experienced with psychedelics, especially acid, so I took the whole tab and stuck Rango (quality film btw) on my TV while I was waiting for the come-up.

It took around 45 mins before I felt anything, I was expericing the typical effects such as tactile enhancement, slight nausea, vision starting to distort but nothing too crazy.

Anyway, fast forward around 2 hours and I'm peaking at this point. The visuals were nothing crazy but there was a noticeable headspace which induced a bit of anxiety. All in all up to this point it's been a pretty mundane trip, until I start to hear footsteps outside my house. I live on a farm so it's not uncommon to hear foxes walking around late at night so I just dismissed it as being that. I was wrong.

Maybe 5 minutes later and I hear the footsteps again and so I decide to take a peek out my window since it's directly above the front door. So I quickly poke my head out and catch a glimpse of something reflective. Fuck. I pause Rango and straight away hear knocking on the door downstairs. I immediately think that I'm hallucinating and going into a bad trip so I sit down on my bed for a couple minutes, telling myself ""you're fine, you've taken acid and you're hallucinating"".

Only I wasn't hallucinating, the knocking persisted until I looked out my window to see two coppers standing outside my door. I'm obviously freaking out at this point, it's like 2 in the morning and police are knocking on my door. My eyes were like fucking dinner plates, I was topless and sweating like a pig.

I decide to face the situation since they clearly weren't leaving. I went and woke my dad up first to let him know and then went downstairs to open the door. There I was tripping balls and these police look at me and one of them gave a little smirk since it was clear I was off my face.

So, the reason the police were knocking on my door at 2 in the morning was because my ex girlfriend had gone missing. She lives under the care of this government progrsm, basically she has her own flat but because she's 17 has to be there by midnight or they call the police and report her as missing. She wasn't actually missing, she just decided not to gone home btw I'm not an arsehole. Because they think I'm still her boyfriend, every time this happens police turn up at my house looking for her. 

I greet these officers topless, practically dripping with sweat. I ask the officers if they'd like to come in and they declined. At this point my dad comes downstairs and they ask him if shes here or if she had been, obviously she wasn't. They ask me if they can look at my messages with her, usually this is something I wouldn't be keen to do since they had no warrant. However given the circumstances and likely some suggestability enhancement from the acid, I grabbed my phone from my room and took it to the police.

He takes a quick look and confirms that I'm telling the truth. I can't remember exactly what they said after that, I just remember staring into one of their bodycams that looked all distorted and the flashing light gave it a really ominous vibe. Kinda reminded me of Autopilot off the film Wall-E. So at this point they're satisfied and decide to leave, they apologise for waking us up and as I'm about to shut the door, one of the officers says to me ""I'm sure you won't have any trouble getting back to sleep"".

Yeah, they knew. I know it's not a crime to be on drugs in you're own home, and most other substances and I wouldn't have been bothered. But I can slip into a bad trip really easily on acid, and the one thing I've always been terrified about is the thought of talking to the police while tripping.

The rest of the trip was really weird. I felt on edge and decided to do some curls with my dumbbell since I had so much energy I had to expel. I was lifting this weight for around 3 hours, taking breaks every now and then. My headspace was dark, for some reason I felt like I was living in a facist, far right world and as I was looking at myself in the mirror I started seeing myself as some sort of far right militant. I'm not right wing, neither would I say I'm left, so I don't know where this came from but it lasted a few hours.

Have you ever wondered why former addicts crave drugs? Why drug cravings persist even after long periods of abstinence? Or whether 'wanting' drugs (drug craving) is attributable to ‘liking’ drugs (to the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs)? Or possibly due to external components altogether?

Some commentary / journal club-esque conversation reviewing the classic addiction research article that began the 'wanting/liking' dichotomy that researchers are still investigating to this day. Titled ""The neural basis of drug craving: An incentive-sensitization theory of addiction"", Terry E. Robinson &amp; Kent C. Berridge present a bio-psychological theory of drug addiction, the ‘Incentive-Sensitization Theory’.

The incentive-sensitization theory of addiction posits the following. 1. Addictive drugs enhance dopamine transmission in brain reward regions 2. A major psychological function of this neural system is to attribute ‘incentive salience’ to the perception and mental representation of events associated with activation of the system (drug associated cues and stimuli). 3. In some individuals the repeated use of addictive drugs produces adaptations in this system, rendering it increasingly and perhaps permanently, hypersensitive (‘sensitized’) to drugs and drug-associated stimuli. This is ultimately a learning &amp; memory based effect.

I have smoked almost everyday without any problems, and since I have started to smoke moderately (due to how much money I was spending), I have produced a more of a negative reaction when under the influence. A lot of times, I'm fine but ""bad trips"" are becoming more frequent than usual. And anxiety/panic attacks seem to be triggered by really small things.

For example, tonight. I had went to the shop and bought some things, returned home late, and relaxed in my room. As I sat, I was looking at my feet and just had a random thought how feet in general are disgusting (even though I keep mine fairly clean). To many reading this, this seems like an innocent and harmless matter of opinion, but it ended up spiraling out of control in less than a minute and I couldn't stop thinking about it.

For some odd reason, this single thought had escalated and I ended up having to immediately put my socks back on and I desperately needed to lie down. I was also nauseated and was ready to be sick, but luckily I wasn't. However, my heart began racing and I turned extremely pale and had to sit and rock back and forth on the stair trying to convince myself that I was okay. And needless to say, I got a drink, calmed down pretty quick, and the symptoms passed. This was all triggered by the sight of... my bare feet and while it's laughable, it's a terrifying experience for me. And this only seems to happen after I smoke. There's other small triggers but this particular incident affected me a lot worse and it's not the first time this has happened regarding certain body parts that normally never bother me when I'm not high.

I know this sounds completely ridiculous but this an issue and it's torturous to go through. This makes me want to die because it really does like impending doom. I still feel shook up and I'm still trembling slightly from what happened tonight. I'm going to watch a movie shortly to take my mind off it.

Regular MD/Coke user here, but for my pals birthday we're going on a camping trip, and have decided to get some shrooms.

I've never taken any form of psychedelics before, mostly due to previous mental health issues, but given the fact this group of pals are a safe group for me, and we'll have someone to trip sit I feel comfortable giving it a go.

However, there are some initial nerves around the whole thing, and my partner has said I shouldn't take anything psychedelic like if I'm not 100% relaxed or I'll have a bad trip. I appreciate his advice, but he's only had shrooms once before, so I'm hoping he's wrong. 

This is the thing that's really held me back in taking stuff before, as I mentioned previous mental health issues here. I'm worried that I'll have a bad trip and end up in a not so fun part of my brain, when I'm only after some fun visuals. However was going to get 1.5g of B+ as that seems to be pretty beginner friendly and see how I get on.

So, is this a terrible idea/should I stay away because of the nerves?
I've also got some Valium which can help chill me out, but I don't like to mix shit that I've not tried before.

If I can add gabapentin to that and print it and bring it I’m in the clear. ANYBODY ABLE TO HELP?!?!? I can pay you thru cash app if needed.

I’m tired of people overstating the benefits of kratom and suppressing those within the kratom-using community that aren’t part of the kratom cult.

I’ve done acid 3 times at 1 tab, 2.5 tabs, and 4 tabs respectively and each time I did it completely alone and handled it pretty well for the most part and I’ve also smoked dmt once alone. I currently have 5g of psilocybin cubensis shrooms.

Although I did have some really cool experiences and insightful thoughts I did not quite have the out of body super visual type experience  I really want to have a heroic type experience with full on ego death, crazy visuals, and deep introspection so I plan on the full 5g alone at night (I know that’s super stupid for my first time but I don’t have that many close friends that I trust). I want to try the Terence McKenna completely dark room thing but I’m also completely broke now and won’t be buying shrooms again for a long time due to their high cost so I want to make the most out of it and get the full trip experience seeing the trippy visuals and like having the peacefulness of nature 

Considering I want to get the most out of the experience let me know if this plan would suffice: 

-Set an alarm for 3am and eat the shrooms along with some orange juice
-lay in my bed in complete darkness until ~6:30 am (not sure if I’ll still be having a strong enough experience by this time to still experience other things)
-go outside and watch the sunrise in my backyard and listen to some music and maybe shower after

Does this sound like a safe and effective plan to get the full shroom experience alone? What should I expect at this dose?

Your opener unequivocally and apologetically states, "" Sourcing drugs is NOT allowed here!"".

And goes on to express this sentiment with CAPS and then close with this little number.

""Just remember that there is no 100% safe drug use. Not using is always safer.""

Now, a brief word on why drug use, particularly opiates, is so dangerous nowadays. As every educated member of this forum should know, regular opiate use has no known unhealthy side effects. Apart from the potential mental addiction, one could safely use heroin daily from cradle to grave. So why the supposed epidemic? Because of mentalities like yours on this sub.

If pure, unadulterated heroin was regulated and sold in every ""liquor store"", folks would stop dyin. Yea, it's scary to think prohibition is causing the very epidemic it purports to fight against. And so my point is, by deliberately forcing sources underground, you are directly contributing to the demise of the next soul who desperately hits up a random dealer on the street to the tune of spiked or pure fentynal.

But more than this, your closer is also baffling to me. I hope we're both aware that the majority of habitual drug users are dual diagnosis, meaning they're attempting to self medicate a condition that's not being properly addressed by society. But you mean to say that no matter the mind state of the individual, or the potential benefit they receive from their illicit substance, that abstaining is ALWAYS less dangerous?

So the war vet who drops mdma with his wife so they can cathartically dispel some heinous PTSD, that's less safe than allowing the flashbacks and paranoia and guilt to continually worsen? And the depressive who sources ketamine that possibly and probably will change his life, they should abstain from using because it's the more dangerous route? I dunno bro, telling every single visitor that no drugs are without danger seems awfully presumptuous. And while you may be correct about a healthy percentage of druggies, I'll easily challenge that there are innumerable folks who are a) informed b) intelligent c) careful and d) really in need of manual chemical rebalancing.

In conclusion, you bring folks together to revel over a scarce product that you prevent them from sourcing. Also the the assumed gross mischaracterization of everyone's ability to use safely, namely they can't because every conceivable drug-person combination poses danger, incurs risk and is NOT preferable to not using. That is one broad generalization... but if I made a similar sweeping generalization about broads... I'd be in trouble.

At the beginning of this year I had little hope or motivation to live. This manifested in habitual drug use and anger and resentment towards my loved ones.

Not only has this year provided me a chance to look at myself with a new perspective, it has reignited my passion for life and empowered me with a vision that prior to this year I couldn’t have dreamt of.

When I was deep into my habitual drug use I believed my best course of action was to disconnect from my family and friends.

I was too ashamed to talk to people of my past and try to connect with them, for fear of the harm I caused them.

My sister-in-law felt my presence was damaging to her daughter, my niece Eevee.

I was more disconnected from my brothers and sister then ever before.

I fought with my My Mom and Dad constantly and they wanted me out of the house.

A part of me thought that living on the streets, or even death, away from all my loved ones, would be the best use of my life. If I went my own way, no longer would I be able to harm them.

Today, I’m closer with my family. I am a positive influence on my niece. I am closer to my brother than we have been since we were children. I am eternally grateful for my parents and everything they have gone through to support me. And I’m beginning to mend relationships of the past.

Most importantly, I finally see that my presence can be a positive influence on the lives of the people I love.

I've started a podcast and a non profit organization, with my brother, since getting clean. Thank you all for taking the time to read this post &lt;3

However, I’ve since read that LESS molly is actually MORE and was reconsidering the dose to be a point instead since that seems to be what DanceSafe recommends, although no two sites or posts anywhere seem to agree on the exact same thing either way so idrk what to believe, including the formula used to calculate the recommended dose based on your weight if that’s even a good way of doing it?

To anyone who’s actually rolled before and has done around both a point as well as 125 mg. or at least something near that in two separate sessions before, do you personally find the “less is more” thing to be true or is it bullshit? What were the biggest differences in both experiences that you noticed, including the come-up, roll itself and the comedown? I get that it’s only a difference in 25 mg. but it seems like that could be noticeable so that’s the main reason why I’m asking. Also, I was planning on rolling with a friend and was going to give her some for it but she’s only 5’2” so she’s pretty small to begin with and I don’t want to accidentally give her too much, so maybe just a point for her or even less than that?

Different drugs (like most of the best tools) can can be used in different ways to help achieve a multitude of different things. 

    As someone with an addictive personality who can easily get obsessed with anything at all but still wants to enjoy drugs I find this way of thinking to be very helpful in practicing self control. 

Here’s a lil analogy for ya:

Shovels are tools, yea?
    
    If you for some reason obsessively use an old ass, shitty ass, grimy ass, stepped on ass, shovel to dig in the middle of the desert everyday you should probably have some gloves and petroleum gel so you don’t absolutely fuck up your hands. 
     
    You should also be certain to be attentive to where and how much you’re digging because when you find yourself deep in a pit of hardened clay and your shovel breaks you may just be too exhausted to pull yourself out, and by nightfall hypothermia, rattlers, and scorpions start to fight over who gets the kill. 
    
    This isn’t to say that there is anything inherently wrong with using a shovel (because why the fuck would there be), just that maybe digging yourself into a hole far away from food water or other living things that aren’t hostile is a really a shitty thing to do to yourself

I am NOT feeling overtly suicidal in the least, my brain just feels confusing and foggy.

When I was 18-19 years old, I ran with a not great, older crowd and I used meth for a period of time. Luckily I was self aware enough that after a couple months of this I realized what I was doing to myself and stopped, knowing that if I ever did a drug like that again I would likely be unable to stop myself. I am now well into my twenties, I avoid anything that makes you feel ""speedy"". I don't even like the little 5 hour energy shots. I remember how desperately I loved that feeling and it's too risky.

A few days ago, when getting ready for work I saw half of an adderal on my boyfriends' dresser. I threw it away and left. I didn't bring it up. Last night we were drinking and I guess it started to get to me because I went on a tangent about how not okay that is and how seriously I NEED to be as far away from things like that as possible. He seemed to understand, said it was only the one time and he wouldn't get them anymore. A few hours passed and he approached me without warning and emptied a capsule into my mouth, saying afterwards, ""There. Now they're all gone, that was the last one"" This was at about 8:30pm.  
I would like to note here that I can't blame him, I allowed it to happen.  
So later on, maybe 30 minutes later, fueled by alcohol we got into an unrelated argument and he left. For the rest of the night I experienced what I can only describe as horrible, back to back, paralyzing anxiety attacks. I tried to sleep and for the couple hours I did I had terrifying lucid dreams that I couldn't manage to wake myself up from. I feel itchy and like I want to scratch my skin completely off. By the time he came back around 6am I found myself curled in a ball silently but desperately begging the universe for release. Somehow I managed to get myself together enough to come to my job. I work at a very small IT company where I will be alone for the entire day. I could have called out but I couldn't bear the thought of being home with him.  
I still feel itchy, my hands are shaky and the only thing keeping me semi functioning has been typing this post. I feel like I want to walk into traffic, I will not do that, its just how I feel. I considered for a moment checking myself in somewhere, but I know that with my mental history that my son would most likely be taken away from me. Which I couldn't bear to happen. So instead I will have to force myself through whatever this is and make myself feel better. I have been doing so well for so long and I am so overwhelmingly angry with myself and with the Universe.

It started around 2pm and lasted (at least for me) until around 3am.

Throughout the first few hours I only consumed some beers (maybe 4-5) and a little CBD. At around 6pm I started to do little bumps of amphetamines because I was a little too chilled and wanted to get into dance mood. This worked perfectly and I felt reaaally good and went dancing a lot.

However, I also planned beforehand to drop some molly later in the evening, so I did at around 10pm (~120mg tested &amp; weighted with a scale, I'm a ~80kg male). Strangely though, I felt it hitting me and I got really touchy and talkative with friends, but no euphoria at all. Nevertheless I enjoyed talking to people, but I somehow lost the interest in dancing, which was strange (never happened before). Then ~3 hours later at 2am, I had a really hard comedown, I'd even call it a crash, all my good mood was destroyed within a matter of 15mins, and I became very melancholic and wanted to be alone. The only thing I could think about was going home, which I eventually did around 3am.

All this after taking a 6 month break, because I misused MDMA in January (took it 4 times in a month, I know, stupid..) and had quite a depressive episode afterwards. I thought a 6 month break would have been enough time to recover.

Now, my question is: Do you guys think that I've destroyed MDMA for myself with my consumption in January and need an even longer pause, or do you think I was bound to have such a hard crash because of the way I consumed it in combination with other substances that evening?

I never had this problem before, and I was always drinking a little bit besides when rolling. Maybe it's also worth mentioning that I stopped smoking weed cold turkey four weeks earlier, hence this was my first role without hitting a joint.

The aftermath of this evening was not bad, I'm feeling great currently, without any depressive vibes.

*HARM REDUCTION; This post is not meant to glorify drugs in any way in fact just the opposite(: Learn from what you read and go into the story w/ an open mind. Not everyone thinks and does as you do! Thanks*

So a couple summers ago I had access to pounds of psilocybin as well as many other bulk substances.

It was an early morning. I woke up and had nothing to do so I spontaneously ate 3.5 grams of golden cap psilocybin mushrooms by myself and figured I'd see where it would get me.

Prior to this I had been microdosing a bit because I always had shrooms and I'd done my research on microdosing psilocybin and LSD to want to experiment and try and use it to treat my depression.

Once I ate those disgusting tasting fuckers it took about 45 min for the onset of the shrooms to settle in and at the time I was just in my basment watching New Girl (great sitcom btw) and thats when I started peaking.

Everything the characters said sounded like they were talking to me personally so I eventually switched to music and that lasted for about 10 minutes. 

Once I peak on psilocybin I almost always have to take a big dump so I left my basment room and went upstairs to the toilet. 

While sitting on the toilet I stare across from me these towels my mom has hanging that we aren't supposed to use, it's just there for aesthetics but anyways I'm lookin at this thing and I get these real neat wiggley almost worm like visuals moving around on the towel from the pattern of if.

After my defececation I left the bathroom not knowing what to do next. I had people supposed to come over but I was tripping so I told them ""like nah bruh now's not the time I'm kinda busy staring at walls and carpets and shit"" lmao

Finally I go into my old room and I take a look at the things I kept as mementos from childhood and growing up. 

I remember taking out gift cards and notes and objects that I used to play with as a kid and I started to burst into tears. 

I thought about all the choices I had made until that moment and how good some of my childhood was even though most of it was lived in fear due to an alcoholic father figure in the house. 

After going through a lot of my things I just laid there on the floor surrounded by the things I had kept for so many years and felt nothing but gratitude and how truley lucky I was to be alive.

I smiled, wiped my tears, cleaned up my things and I took a shower after to really think things over in comfort. 

When my mom came home later in the evening I told her thank you, that I loved her and gave her a big hug.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,696159,public,confidence,self,Eating an 1/8th of shrooms and crying,0,[],0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hwe53q/eating_an_18th_of_shrooms_and_crying/,no_ads,0.0,1595533204.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Usually these “neuroscience/drug” experts just write oversimplified or very flawed explanations as to how different drugs effect the brain.

One misconception that I’ve seen a lot is the notion that benzodiazepines don’t affect dopamine levels, it’s usually something along the lines of “benzos affect GABA not dopamine”. The thing about the human brain is that it’s a lot more complex and intricate than people seem to think. Stimulants are the only drugs that have a direct effect on dopamine pathways, they’re usually either dopamine reuptake inhibitors or D2 receptor agonists. But that doesn’t mean that’s the only way to affect dopamine and therefore cause feelings of pleasure.

For instance the neurotransmitter GABA has various functions in the brain and it only exhibits its effects when it binds to specific receptors. As of today we only know of two GABA receptors GABA(A) and GABA(B). When GABA enters a GABA(A) receptor it produces feelings of sedation and muscle relaxation, whereas GABA(B) is involved in controlling dopamine levels in the reward pathway (so basically the “good” euphoric dopamine, cortical dopamine is mainly involved in alertness and cognition). Brain receptors either shut down or open up in response to ionic concentrations (that’s a whole nother complicated mechanism that I won’t get into). Basically what benzodizepines like xanax or valium do is mess with this system and force GABA(A) receptors to be permanently open therefore taking in more GABA than they should and causing anti-anxiety effects. What this also means though is that GABA(A) receptors take up all the available GABA and there isn’t enough left for GABA(B) receptors. As a result the mechanism by which GABA inhibits dopamine release when there’s too much of it is shut down, without this form of regulation the brain becomes flooded with dopamine as it keeps being continuously produced.

So in a nutshell just because benzos do not affect dopamine directly it doesn’t mean that they don’t increase dopamine levels, therefore causing some euphoria. It’s worth mentioning though that unlike cocaine or amphetamine addiction a lot more is involved in benzo dependence. Too much GABA in GABA(A) causes the brain to just slow down all physical processes and if that happens too often our bodies become used to working in “slow” mode, leading to unusual feelings of agitation, increased heartrate and a lower seizure threshold during withdrawals. This is the so-called  “physical dependence”. Alcohol, opioids and other downers in general also work through relatively similar mechanisms, although other receptors such as opioid receptors also play a role in these cases.

I hope this was informative and please do your research before talking about these things.

&amp;#x200B;

I was in my room I had a baggie of edibles. Since I've been in quarantine I've been bored as hell and took edibles 2 times before this. They were THC gummies the brand was Dazed and Infused. One of my homies hooked me up with them earlier. I was planning on selling the bag, then I found 60$ in my pants pockets from a few days ago that was on the floor.  It was about 2:00 am and I was bored as shit and had nothing else to do. So I was like fuck it and took the edibles. About 5 minutes later I snuck out the back door with my skateboard. I was skating to the park and I was listening to some music I think it was Ski Mask the Slump God. I like ski mask cause when he raps his flow is hella weird like on faucet failure. When I'm high that music is the shit. I went into the park and the edibles started kicking in HARD. I tried to do a kickflip but I fell and scraped the skin of part of my knee. That shit hurt and I was screaming. I was in the park acting like a fucking insane crack head. I saw some people turning on they lights and I dipped. I ran to this alley. It was 3:00 something I looked on Snapchat to see if anyone was up I posted it on my story. One of my homies replied saying he was up. He had a few tabs of acid. I said FUCK yea and told him to slide over. I took 2 tabs and we were hanging in his car. I was legit falling asleep my homie had to keep waking me up. We heard police sirens cause sum bitch called the cops on me cause I was out in the park screening earlier. I told him to drive me up by Mc Donald I got an Mc Flurry and fries. I ate my food in the parking lot and the tracers started kicking in. I checked the time and it was 5:00 am and I was like OH SHIT had to get home before my parents realized I wasn't at home. My dad wakes up really early sometimes so I was praying that he wasn't awake. There was a cruiser and they saw me and the cop got out to talk to me and I Bolted I ran as fast as I could and turned a corner and hid under a car and he drove by me. My heart was beating super fast. I used google maps and started walking home I was running and got home about 30 minutes later. This is what I texted him ""Yo bro I love you"" and he responded ""Love you too homie"" I was like"" I'm not gay and gay porn is gross but Fuckkkkk"" he's like ""go to sleep high boi"".I was hearing whispers like voices in my head and I was starting to freak out I opened the door took my shoes off and started walking upstairs. I was trynna be quite but I was tripping balls and I already took 4 edibles. I was kinda loud I think my parents knew. I went into my room and laid down. Ionno why but whenever I take edibles I get Madddddd horny and my dick was mad hard. But at this point, I COULDN'T think at all I remembered a video but I couldn't type. I eventually searched up hentai and picked a vid and watched it I couldn't focus on the video tho. Eventually, I finished and went to sleep. I recorded the videos on snap and I also posted hentai to my story Ionno why I don't remember doing that and I have a bunch of videos of me acting like a dumbass.

My first RC I tried was 6-APB(MDA substitute). This was a year ago when I just found about RC's, I bought 1.5g's succinate. It was a really fun and exciting 2 days, yea it only lasted me 2 days back to back with one 8hr break in between. Now if you do the math that would be around 750mg's a day right?! Wrong, I did 1g the first day and 500mg's the next day with only one 8hr break in between it all. 1.5g's in a 2 day period was extremely dumb and dangerous. My brain was fried for a whole 2 weeks, I had severe amnesia and memory loss , I had these weird brain zaps every 30mins, and the depression was at a real dangerous level. The only upside to it all was the dreams, my dreams were really vivid, interactive, and plentiful for 2 weeks. I would wake up 5 different times at night and each time it would put me into another dream. My theory on dreaming is that when you have low levels of serotonin and your brain starts to produce more, while you're sleeping your brain starts back to making more serotonin somehow causing you to dream a lot more often than when your serotonin levels are already normal.

*FAQ*
Q:What was you feeling at 1g into the binge?
A:the euphoria was thru the roof, I didn't feel hungry or tired, and the visuals where noticably getting stronger and intensifying.

Q:was their at any point in time into the binge were you started to get scared of redosing? 
A:not really, I was feeling invincible up into the first 500mg's. After that I started reminding myself after every redose to slow down and keep track of the amount I had already consumed. I wasn't scared tho because the high was controlling my every emotion.

Q:any permanent damage to the brain that you have noticed?
A: The only thing I would say that it effected was my memory, it's hard to notice it because it mostly repaired itself within a month after but it didn't go back to the same old memory I had. If 100% means perfect memory, then I'm probably at 90% now.

Q:why did you never buy it again?
A:I couldn't control myself when It came to redosing, I felt more and more invincible after every 100mg's I consumed and that's terrifying for me.

Q:why are you so retarded?
A:when you're on that level of fucked up the euphoria is soooo huge that the huge amount of happiness you feel overrides every single emotion and decision making skills that you had before the binge.

Q:what's your favorite RC now?
A:5-MAPB is my favorite RC of choice because I'm more of a euphoria chaser then a stimulant chaser and 5-MAPB is all about the euphoria and less about the stimulation.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,696108,public,confidence,self,The first and last time I try 6-APB,0,[],0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hwazi8/the_first_and_last_time_i_try_6apb/,no_ads,0.0,1595515726.0,9469b226-728a-11e9-b0d5-0ebd9c4fbbf8,Long Post,,Custom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1595487670.0,

It was around the afternoon when he was taking a dab and I asked for a small hit. I inhaled for no more than 6 secs and ended up accidentally swelling some of the smoke sending me into a heavy coughing fit. The coughing kept getting worse and within moments I was ben over the toilet emptying my stomach. It was all ok up until this point.

My throat was burning and my stomach was on fire my boyfriend helped me into bed and we layed there watching some TV. I remember listening to the music and suddenly the room just completely morphed, the TV was on a loop and every move I made seemed to repeat itself like I was a vodeo game character lagging in place.

I closed my eyes and just accepted that I was really fuckin high and that it would were off. I was laying there until I got this really painful electrical spark in my head, I couldn't control my hands and legs anymore and then my body started shaking, I was having a seizure and it took my entire will power to tell my boyfriend. Things get fuzzy by this point i remember everything in my vision going black i could only hear the things around me and the sounds were on this loop repeating over and over. I had this pain in my chest and then remember nothing, until I could see my boyfriend above me holding his hand down on my mouth, apparently I was screaming i dont remember much after the second siezure, I remember being on the floor in his living room and a cop kicking me with his foot, and then i remember a hospital room.

All i know is that during the whole thing i truly believed i was dead and was yelling for someone to make it stop. Things would go back to normal only for it to immediately loop all over again. I thought i was in some sort of limbo stumbling around in a deep black hell. Apparently my siezure caused an induced psychosis that sent me over the edge.

After black ing out in the hospital room, I woke up in my bed at home.

I haven't touch wax sense then. And sometimes as im going to sleep or smell a dab rig I get a slight looping sensation for just a second. I'm not terrified of drugs at all from the experience, but I definitely don't trust my physical reactions to things anymore, I dont do wax in fear of having another siezure or freak out.

Jul 22, 2020

around 11:30 PM I woke up from sleeping from 8 PM as I was extremely tired from staying up all night before. So 11:30 PM I had taken 2x.25mg of Xanax for a total of .5mg a low dose for sure but that was all I had lol. I had not taken any Xanax for about a week and a half. Around 12-12:20 AM I started to kinda feel the meds kick in nothing extreme just felt a bit warmer and I did a check on my motor skills and speech everything was normal I was a bit tired but nothing more than normal. The overall feeling was kinda dark and hard to explain nothing crazy dark thojust empty I feel is a good term to use.  Then around 12:30 I got bored and knew I had taken a low dose so I would not feel much of anything anyway so I then took a 20mg of short-acting Ritalin ( 4x5mg). In my mind, I knew it was safe because doing research about ANYTHING is the best thing you can possibly do for yourself. I was a bit worried they would just cancel out and I would feel nothing which was true for about 20-30 minutes after the taking of the Ritalin. Then I had a feeling I never had before its hard all most impossible to explain but for me, it was actually feeling happy while on ADHD meds it was euphoric made me want to dance to music and just chill at the same time.  I do not know if this is for everyone but with me its a 50/50 chance when I take Ritalin or methylphenidate I might feel a need to clean or do everything hell I impulsively painted the entire basement one night on methylphenidate because it bothered me how the colours didn't match. But then times I could take the same dose and just chill on the couch and fall asleep or watch youtube. when taken with Xanax it was a perfect balance I did not feel like my brain was running at a million miles per hour but also I felt I could focus and do things if needed.

I gathered up the courage to tell my psychiatrist about my addiction and I promised her from then on I’d only take them as prescribed, I do have severe anxiety so I actually need them but obviously not in dosages that get me high like I used to take. I managed to stick to the plan and after I found the right combination of antidepressants and started smoking more weed as a relaxation agent I found myself not even needing or craving them anymore.

But recently my grandma had a cancer diagnosis and that took a massive toll on my mental health, for the past week I felt incredibly agitated and anxious in a way that I hadn’t felt in a long time. So yesterday I caved in, I took 3mg xanax and oh my god it felt good. I’ve tried a bunch of drugs (I mean only alcohol, marijuana and a few psychs so not the actual heavy stuff though) and nothing compares to the feeling of benzos. It’s like a major flood of dopamine and GABA. And I’m so tempted to do it again today.

I know how bad they are for me, seriously my memory is still fucked from 6 months of daily binges, I struggle to remember conversations I’ve had with my friends all the time and my resting heart rate is constantly over 130, yet it’s so hard to resist them.

*This post is meant to share a moment of weakness in my past (it's been years since) and I in no way mean to promote the use of acid or other substances. Especially when behind the wheel! HARM REDUCTION is its purpose okay? To keep others from making similar mistakes. Read w/ an open mind*

It all began a normal day as usual. I woke up and got dressed and I didn't know what I was going to do that day so of why not spontaneously drop 2 tabs of acid before work right?

 I drop around noon and things are GREAT. Im at home waiting for my friends to text me back and I'm outside in the backyard climbing the tree lmao. Eventually my friend who we'll call Mark for the time being gets back to me and I make the not so brilliant idea of driving over to him and picking him up. 

Now remember I have work at 4:00PM and I pick mark up and everything is freaking cool man. I could drive perfectly fine even w/ a passenger in the seat an hour into my acid trip. So now let's say it's about 3:30pm because Mark and I decided we needed weed before work and no one is hitting us back.

 I've been driving for a good while now but finnally at 4:00pm Marks sister gets us our bag and we're on our way we get to work we smoke and by this time I'm feeling really high and its 4:30 we're late to work. Mark and I get out of my car and we leave the bud in the center console and we walk toward our place of work which was a small ma and pop pizza shop.

 Once we make our way towards the building we work at Mark starts asking me questions and I'm just able to keep up with him I'm forgetting what we're talking about and the next thing you know Mark looks over at me and says ""oh you're about to experience something right here buddy good luck"" and we walk inside the pizza shop. 

Now immediately Marks first mistake was he shook me up when he said that so when we walked inside I immediately felt like I was a hostile in an enemy hotzone and once we entee the kitchen the boss starts yelling at the two of us because we were late and how I missed the day before. I told him ""My car wouldn't start so we had to walk"" and we walked away to put our aprons on. 

Now keep in mind its a Saturday night at a busy pizza shop okay. We get there late and the place is slammed they are taking orders out the butthole the place was hectic even if you weren't tripping. Everyone's in the kitchen making orders meanwhile I'm hallucinating while folding pizza boxes by myself in the back room LMFAO. 

The boss comes in and yells at me and tells me to help make orders because we are slammed so I stumble my way into the kitchen and scootch past everyone in this tight space to go and physically write down the pizza order. I really remember this part because I was shaking so badly it was like i had tremors all in my body. My handwriting looked like Egyptian writing by the time I was done.

 Anyways I've been at work for maybe 20 mins now and I go over to the counter to roll my pizza and im surrounded by employees I don't know and I'm staring at my order trying to make one pizza but I was so mezmorized by the cheese and spreading it around w/ my hands it took me forever to make that pepperoni pizza lol Mark had to check up on me. 

Eventually after leaving the Pizza shop through the back door several times despite my friend Mark encouraging me to stay I eventually decided that I couldn't do it anymore and I left. Then I started blacking out or experiencing ego death... 

I thought I died and went to hell or some sort of lawless land where nothing mattered and every time I blacked out thats how I would react. I remember the first time I ""died"" I pulled my phone out of my pocket and threw it on the ground as hard as I could because I figured I didnt need it anymore, I was dead.

 I remember trying to find my car after ""dying"" multiple times and hallucinating all kinds of things from manicans standing on porches to objects that would deconstruct and reconstruct right in front of me.

 Eventually after tripping sack for about 30+ mins I found my car (right down the street) and tried to wait out the trip in there but I was just uneasy. People kept passing by and it made me uncomfortable. I even approached a couple on their porch near my car and asked them how they were because they were looking at me... 

They could tell something was up because they offered to let me stay and rest there instead of my car but I didn't feel comfortable w/ that either so I got in the car and made one of the worst mistakes I could have ever made in my life which is I tried to drive home on ACID.

 I got in my car started it put it in drive and it didn't take but a minute or two for me to black out into that ego death mentality and while I was driving blacked out I even thought I could hit someone if I wanted to and it wouldn't matter because I'm dead and none of this is real... 

I crashed once I started driving about 5 minutes or less down the road and I even managed to fit my 2005 honda civic to fit between a fire hydrant and a lightpole (still blacked out) then I crashed into the only two garbage cans the church had. I didn't cause any damage to the church at all thanks to those tiny garbage cans. 

Once I crashed I continued to go around doing whatever I wanted like, slapping a bare mans belly and running away, jumping on the hood of a moving car, shouting at the neighbors because they were shouting at me because I didn't understand what was going on, and much more. I had come in and out of reality multiple times at this point and I even apologized to the people I may have scared or harassed and askes them to call 911.

 I remember laying there waiting for the ambulance or cops to come and I was still blacking out but this time I was really in another state of mind. I was out of my body listening to what sounded like my mothers voice keeping me out of danger and my dog was barking in the background and it sounded like someones was trying to take me or hurt me.

 Regaurdless I have my own theries as to what this could mean but the ambulance and police officer had showed up and I had admitted to them that I was on LSD because I really just wanted to go home and be okay. I went to the hospital after some minor hallucinations prior to that and my mother came and picked me up angry and dissapointed of course around 9:30pm from the ER. Moral of the story is set and setting and don't drive on acid guys.

Dramatic post incoming.

I have ADHD and was prescribed Adderall for roughly two years and then seitched to Vyvanse 30 mg for about 3 weeks before shit went down. I was smoking concentrated THC at night. I took my vyvanse around 1 p.m that day and smoked hard around 9 30 p.m.
 2 hours later my blood pressure was rising to an unusual level and this abnormal blood pressure and heart rate gradually increased until 3 hours from the onset of those symptoms. Then gradually, my bp returned to ""normal"" but with left arm pain and heart palpitations.
Yes I have a blood pressure monitor. Yes I monitored my bp every 30 minutes when I started to detect a problem.
The whole episode lasted roughly 6 hours, so my heart and blood pressure were super higher for that duration.
I felt like I had a heart attack. I didn't go to the hospital durig that episode because I was scared of telling my parents I did weed. Well i regret that decision now because I now have exercise intolerance, dizziness, chest pain, and heart palpitations. I canmot exercise like I used to. I cannot lightly jog in place for 5 minutes without experiencing a drop in diastolic blood pressure.
I get a wide pulse pressure whenever I exert myself, like today I had caffeine to see if I still have these heart troubles, and my bp was 122/67.
That's not normal for me.

I went to the cardiologist, did an echo. He found mild tricupsid insufficiency and mitral prolapse and said my heart looked healthy and I shouldn't worry about either defect.

Im scared I may have Pulmonary Hypertension, caused or aggravated by that weed and vyvanse mixture. My heart was racing for 6 hours straight its quite possible this caused scarring or thickening of my pulmonary arteries.
I ain't a doc, but I'm just going by my symptoms. Talking leaves me slight out of breath. My diastolic pressure does not go above 75 and can be as low as 55.

I'm scared of dying. I also have elevated liver enzymes and fluid build up in my abdomen. I am going to the gastro tomorrow to discuss what the next step in investigating my liver issues is going to be.
Im so scared of dying from either cirrhosis or from pulomary hypertnesion or what ever the heck I have.
Cardiologist is willing to do an exercise stress test so he can see for himself what Im talking about. Im literally having palpitations right now and its not letting me sleep. I also have a dry cough that I ve had for years.

Please send me your blessings. And please no one send me hate.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,696098,public,confidence,self,Two unlike drugs lead to my fear of dying,0,[],0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hwa5nb/two_unlike_drugs_lead_to_my_fear_of_dying/,no_ads,0.0,1595511578.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1595485514.0,

They pulled the plug today.

I’m not sure how to feel because he was of my only friends and if it was intentional I had no idea he was hurting that bad. I had warned him about Xanax. Especially when taken with alcohol. He had talked me out of suicide multiple times and said that we’d always have each other. Losing him still doesn’t feel real.

(early 40s)... 1 night of mild partying (maybe 1g each over the course of 8 hours) can literally take us 3 to 4 days to fully recover from. We've decided the cost isn't worth the reward.

But here's the thing.. we're both social introverts, and when we're on coke, we can make friends EASILY. We're 'swingers' and we love other couples.. but without coke, it's impossible.. and frankly, we come across so 'cold' that it's just a waste of time.

So we need a solution... I've experimented with Adderall+Alcohol with decent success. It does work for me for the most part (it's not coke.. that's for damn sure.. but it's okay).. though she's never tried it.

However, we BOTH like Phenibut.. it seems to put us in a very natural-feeling good mood, without the stim effects of coke... But it's VERY subtle.

I'm curious if anyone has tried Adderall + Phenibut. (Adderall for the energy and focus, and ability to socialize... combined with Phenibut to get the good mood).  It would be nowhere near coke level, but it might be good enough...  The only downside here is that I don't think alcohol is supposed to be mixed with Phenibut.. which might make socializing a little awkward.  Also, I'm unclear on the dosages that would be effective.  (1.5g of Phenibut puts me in a great mood.. and I typically like about 15mg of adderall, but only if I can drink some alcohol to smooth out the jitters.. so I have no idea how Phenibut + Adderall is going to work if there's no alcohol on board...)

Anyone tried it? What dosage? What was your experience?

Finally, do you think Phenibut + Adderall would be safe for someone with moderate anxiety issues (wife)?  She also has moderately high blood pressure (treated and under control), which becomes a huge problem when it comes to coke... but maybe less problematic with adderall.. ?

Well, I'm not 100% sure about continuing my ""use"" so make of this post what you will. Essentially, I'm just asking for unique, interesting drugs to try. so just comment if you don't want to read a whole backstory. 

I suppose that the crux of my drug experimentation is about experiencing novel or interesting experiences. Being in a unique state of mind far removed or different from a sober mindstate is what interested me most. Such so that alcohol isn't too interesting, because being drunk isn't groundbreaking. Accordingly, I found Acid to basically be the perfect drug for me. As expected, my use quickly skyrocketed. However, after a horrible experience with acid, I don't think usage of psyches is the safest for me, and I doubt I'll be comfortable using them again. I intended to leave behind all drug use, but the itch is still there. I don't think I'll be (or can) leaving this lifestyle too soon. However, I find myself without a drug of choice. DXM crossed my mind as an ""interesting"" experience, but honestly, after the initial infatuation passed, DXM is akin to ""super alcohol"" and not as interesting as I first thought. Other candidates (that I've never tried before) are Ketamine and MDMA. I think I would find Ket's dissociation interesting, and MDMA is just something I've always wanted to try. So I suppose I'm asking for ..new drugs to try.. PS: i tow the onion fields so nothing's off limits. 

Wow this turned out rather long-winded, but this is something that's just been stewing in my mind for a bit.

Of course Adderall wasn't any better, with bad vasoconstriction and chest pain, hence the change.  I could take a long acting weak benzo along with my Ritalin to smooth off the edges a bit, but that only further diminishes the effects of Ritalin, which as I mentioned, is already weak.

I do have a personal stash of meth that I use once a month with minimal use (5\~10mg, oral or snort, never smoked), and even that alone would give me comparable effects of 20\~40mg of Adderall, without the awful vasoconstriction that comes with any Adderall consumption. I'm of course not here to justify or encourage meth use of any amount to anyone for any occasion (unless prescribed), but the effects of a minimal, regulated, and well supplemented dose was clearly the right amount of boost and concentration I was looking for in the absence of Adderall. 

Ritalin (Methylphenidate) is a NDRI, and meth (Methamphetamine) is a potent dopamine releaser. So would it be reasonable to take a smaller dose of Ritalin (20mg, 10mg each) with a micro-dose of meth (1\~3mg, &lt; 5mg) instead? This idea stemmed from the Rx version of meth (Desoxyn), which comes in 5mg tablets, and considering the questionable quality of any street meth, I thought the amount should be even lower than that just to be safe. Would this be (at least to an extent) sustainable to take everyday, or once a week only, or just ditch the idea completely? 

I don't believe there's much of an addiction potential either way, since I personally hate the fiendish feeling and paranoia that comes with moderate/high doses, and I always strive to maintain the sweet spot energy and motivation using the lowest dose possible (tolerance control). I just want to be able to live each day as productive and motivated as I can, nothing more or less.

**TLDR; Ritalin sucks. Too much anxiety and restlessness. Thinking about lowering Ritalin dose and adding in micro dose of meth (daily or weekly or monthly or etc).

Now I don’t like circles. Have a good day

So my sister came back from Basic training and A.I.T in the Army so I’m over at her place hanging out. After awhile she goes to bed and I’m up playing COD with her fiancé. He’s a veteran with 3 (4?) tours in Iraq/Afghanistan. He has medicinal marijuana for his PTSD. He offers me some.

Now I’m more of a blunt and THC cartridge type guy but he pulls out a little one foot tall bong and packs a hits worth. What he didn’t tell me was that it was *his* one hit worth of weed and that there was no water in the bong. So me, being the *“can’t look like a bitch in front this hardened veteran that’s going to be my brothers-in-law,”* I took the FATTEST fucking rip of my life and immediately regret it because, once again, no water in the bong. So it feels like I just inhaled mustard gas and my lungs are on fire and I’m damn near crying. Luckily he was high already and not pay attention because I’m pretty sure I’m dying.

At this point, I still haven’t exhaled because of the pure shock that my lungs are going through. I realize I need to breathe (it was probably only like 8 seconds). I exhale and begin to cough a lot obviously lol. I stopped myself from coughing and begin the highest I have been in my entire fucking life. I just tell him that “I’m chilling” even though I’m ballsack high at this point. 

After about 5 minutes, I damn near feel like I’m on shrooms. I mean I am *FUCKED*. The ceiling starts looking so fucking cool.

Right at this moment, I had the ultimate, most high thought I have ever had...

“I like this ceiling. It’s so straight. I can only work in straight lines. I don’t like rounded edges on squares.”

So now you have me in this retard state commenting on just about any girls page who I find remotely attractive. Anyone from girls I knew in grade school, girls who I occasionally hook up with that I could easily just text, girls who I follow but have never met, instagram models who will never see my comment, sisters of friends, friends of my sisters.... We're talking about 30 comments total over the course of and hour and a half... And these comments weren't anything innocent like ""Hey!"" or ""Nice pic!"" there were incomprehensible horny slurs. Heres an example... ""Hu Kateh wanna come o ver""'

I will for sure, she hasn't decided yet if she will.

Anyways, I was planning to fast for the day until I drink the tea to both alleviate nasuea and increase potency. Obviously, mescaline lasts for quite a long time.

I'll absolutely bring a ton of water. That's a precaution I always take when tripping. But my question was whether it would be a bad idea to eat, and if so, when?

When I do 4-aco-dmt (by far the substance I have the most experience with), food tastes like sand, and feel like rocks in my stomach that twist it until they come out the other end. Lsd, I'm usually fine with eating, as long as I don't eat anything super greasy/unhealthy/heavy. I was wondering where mescaline stands on that scale, and what we should bring to eat.

My other question was about weed. I'm probably going to bring some weed, in case I'm not very affected by the substance. I know she will, even if she doesn't have mescaline. I've got both sativa (Lemonnade) and indicia (cherry pie). Since mescaline is stimulating, I'd imagine a sativa could synergize with it, but an indicia could help chill things out of it got to be too stimulating.

I was in painful agony with stomach aches and all the typical opiates stuff. I slept most of the time and took cigarettes and played games the rest of the time. I was given a drug to sort out the withrawl symptoms  Buprenorphine  i think its called. I only had the most severe symptoms for 5 days. After that i stopped requesting the medication and told them i wanted to just quit fast so the symptoms didnt last so long. The two last days i was super angry that i had to wait there so long since i didnt have any sort of withdrawl symptoms. I was more bothered with the boredom and just wanted to go to the rehab centre.

After ive been at the rehab centre for a few days the cravings are just so intense. It's agony, thats all i can describe it. Heroin wasnt even that good. INfact i have craved cocaine, alchol aswell and it took awhile before i started to want heroin. I just dont see an end to this. I'm afraid its going to last for years. I'm 22, i cant fucking take this. I want to kill myself or end up on the street. just so i can get heroin. 

I said to myself before i went to the rehab centre, ""I'm not going to be one of those who go in and out of rehab for years and waste my life like that."" but now i understand. This drug is no joke, ive done many types of drugs. Got hooked on amphetamine. The withdrawls are nothing alike. Amphetamine withdrawl was the first day. Then it was over more or less apart from the lethargy. I'm going crazy, they dont give methadone or anything like that here unless i apply for it. But i need to have physical symptoms i think.   


As all the negative about the drug fades away and i no longer remember the reason i wanted to quit so badly. The cravings get worse and i'd even be willing to get on the street just to get rid of this awful emotional pain i have in my gut. But deep inside i know its the wrong choice, part of me has stopped caring though. I'm not a man who cries alot. Infact i cant let my self cry even if i want to. But this is so bad i actually cried in front of my doctor when i was telling him how i was feeling like.

The psychological, emotional and cravings is 100x worse than the pain. I can deal with muscular pain etc. But the other stuff its so much worse. I didnt think it would be like that cus all other drugs seemed to be so fucking lackluster in symptoms. Working out doesnt help.

Just a curious question for anyone experienced with my query. 

When sniffing horse tranquillisers is it better to crush the crystals on a hard surface which in a sense crushes them whilst still having that roughness. Or does probably crushing them down into a fine powder better? A mate of mine has been using a pestle and mortar to turn it into a powder which should hit oneself quicker but in my opinion; leaves the nose cavity sooner (backdrop) and then unless you swallow it which is great to Khole but horribly bad for your stomach, bladder and that.. So you ultimately end up spitting it out which wastes k.
Or does crushing it on say your phone with a card or something and doing let it sink in your nose longer to get more out of it?

  So I was sitting at the beach and having a casual few drinks by myself, my phone died so I was kind of just people watching.. It was kind of busy but each group of people were social distancing. There were a group of young people on my left whom I was sharing light conversation with. I was only about 5 beers in and I had a chicken burger beforehand so I was buzzed but nothing crazy and the people next to me ask to borrow my lighter to light a joint. Now this is where everything gets a little fuzzy..

  I remember lighting the joint for them, probably because they couldn't figure out how to use it (one of those fancy engraved plasma lighters) I smoked maybe just a puff or two (I'm not much of a chronic anymore these days). And then BAM I was like paralyzed dazing in and out. I was laying on my towel and I could sort of open my eyes and I could clearly hear everything they were saying and they were going on about taking my shit. I tried to jump up but I couldn't move a muscle in my body and then dazed off again. I came too maybe 4 or 5 hours later. The sun had gone down and the beach was empty. Since my phone was dead I'm estimating that I was non responsive from about 7pm-midnight.

   I got up! But I could not fucking walk for the life of me, all my stuff my longboard, my Polaroid and my lighter was with me, nothing was stolen. Turns out I couldn't fucking walk but I was very capable of riding my board. And I managed to get myself home safely, not sure why I had absolutely no balance on my feet but outstanding balance on my board.

  I really don't believe that I was drugged but the fact that a couple puffs could do that to me is really embarrassing. The guy gave me his number because he wanted to buy some DMT off me and he didn't even steal my lighter so I think he was a stand up dude, though I have tried texting him several times and no answer.

I'm interested in psychedelics, and the science behind it, but I'm too young to try psychedelics myself. I have spent a lot of time thinking about it and reading about it. That probably has to do something with this.

Our experience so far was very different than expected. We've both done macro-doses of LSD before, but had never experimented with microdosing. I think we were both expecting something different - like a little party every third day - a way to get high without really getting high, but it was nothing like that for us. It was surprisingly stressful. We both have desk jobs and it took us a while to get the dosing right. I started at 10ug, then 15, then back to 10, but all of that was too much for me and I found that 7.5 was best to not feel incredibly jittery (like crazy caffeinated), but feel a slight perkiness.

We kept daily audio logs of our experiences and moods, and overall both of our experiences were similar. We started out very excited to start the experience, but after two doses that were too high, our mood quickly changed and we began to loathe the dose days. At the very end of the two weeks we came around again - I feel like we began to surrender to the experience at which point it became more pleasant.

If you have any notes about ways we could've improved on this, please let us know! We were recommended by many within the community to try at least four weeks, so we still have two more weeks of the experience to account for, which we'll be summarizing in our episode coming out next week.

It’s the king of dissociatives (maybe tied with MXE but that is impossible to find now), very comparable to Ketamine except it solves every issue that Ketamine has (short duration, high volume of powder needed, non oral bioavailability), plus it has a flavor of its own which adds depth, color and psychedelic richness that ketamine (especially R isomer) can lack at times. 

It can range to blissfully sedative yet functional in lower doses to spiritually profound in higher doses, and it combines wonderfully with psychedelics as well. It’s clean, doesn’t ravage your body (like MXPr) or your mind (like the PCx analogues). 

I haven’t touched my bag in months but the experiences I have with it remain some of the most memorable that I’ve ever had, and boy have I had some wild experiences combining dissociatives and psychedelics.

Don’t do it, it’s the worst. 

Someone recently posted about spice (“synthetic weed”) and I thought I’d share my experience in its own post, since my comment ended up being a cathartic story telling experience. 

The thing about the effect of spice is it’s a) different for everyone, and b) usually very overwhelming the first time. I had a friend laugh uncontrollably for over half an hour after smoking it for the first time. 

It is definitely the drug that has had the worst long term effect on me, because short term I felt amazing on it. I’ve had a really good and controlled reaction to every drug I’ve tried, and I think I’ve done all the “acceptable” drugs, including being a heavy stoner for a few years. So for me spice was a great high. 

Yes it stoned me to hell and back, but a buddy and I were usually smoking together, I was young living life hard and because of the fun side of it I just ignored the negative effects. Like how apathetic and anti social we became. We stopped doing anything with our friends, didn’t go out, didn’t try to get with girls, we just played video games at my house every day after work, smashing bongs of spice. 

This went on for months. 

It got to the point where anytime I wasn’t working I was smoking spice, including waking up a couple of times a night to hit a bong. 

It started fucking up my life, I got addicted and it got super cheap - 10g for the price of 1g of weed, and delivered to your door. I started smoking and got used to it when I was working in a job where I couldn’t fail a drug test, but a while after that it became hugely popular in my city for a few months because there was a crazy weed shortage and spice was legal so it suddenly boomed. I live in a country where 1 in 7 people smoke weed (present day). 

One morning in the middle of the week I found myself waiting at a bus stop for the busses to start so I could travel 40 minutes to a shop I knew would be open. It was at that point I realised I had a serious problem. 

I quit soon after and so did my friend, although to be honest I think it was the main thing that jumpstarted his slow descent into long term mental problems (depression, apathy etc). I’m pretty sure it literally made me a bit dumber. For a long time after I felt like I just wasn’t thinking as intelligently as I did before.  

It’s a drug for people who want to tune out of life as much as possible, it’s effects and cheap manufacturing cost is why it’s a huge problem with homeless people.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,696012,public,confidence,self,My experience with Spice,0,[],0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hw17lp/my_experience_with_spice/,no_ads,0.0,1595477746.0,,Synthetic Cannabimimetic,,Cannabinoids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a full-time job in addition to this side project, so I've been trying to portion my time on the project throughout the week.

The thing is, I really can't get myself to focus on it for more than 15 minutes at a time. I'm the same way with my regular job, but being on the clock helps me visualize an ""end goal"" and be more efficient. In the case of this side project, it's basically going to be weighing on my mind until I finish it.

So I've decided to reserve all the work for this weekend (Sat/Sun) instead of doing it after work during the week. Without any substance involved, I *think* I could finish by Monday. But ""finishing"" means cramming for the last few hours and submitting something sub-par.

Anyway, I think my best course of action is to take something for focus. I've done a little research on it, but I'm still largely confused on how to go about this (only things I take regularly are weed/psychs).

So, a few questions:

1) What's my best option? I've read Modafinil is the best, but adderall has always been the quintessential ""focus"" drug to me. What should I pick?

2) I can't get an actual prescription (in time, anyway), so what will my plug have? Should I just ask him if he has anything for focus? Or should I ask him for something specific?

3) I took Adderall once in high school, but it did nothing for me. What can I expect this to be like?

4) Would I be okay taking (insert substance here) two days in a row? Should I be worried about any side effects?

5) Should I take height/weight into account when dosing?

6) How much should I be looking to pay?

Sorry for sounding like a total newbie, I just really don't want to fuck myself over here. I'm slowly cracking under the pressure of this project, and I'd rather have a solid plan to get it done over the weekend.

We started out on a huge boulder over looking the ocean. I live in a country famous for it’s beautiful sandy white beaches and on this particular morning it was completely empty as well as very misty. I remember  looking out at the ocean surrounded by a glowing halo of white mist and feeling like I was at the end of the world. But then I closed my eyes and saw a lot of very angry red emojis so I told the girl and my boyfriend we had to leave and find a new spot because thus one was bad. This is where it gets funny. 

The girl lived in the area and wanted to take us to this little road that was very long and had the back walls of houses that were all different colours and textures. We called it the alleyway and walked up and down it a few times, pressing our faces against all the different types of walls. It was a pretty amazing experience. Then we got tired and sat down. We were peaking around here. My boyfriend left to go for a swim and I was left with the girl. We started speaking about EVERYTHING and really connected (we are now best friends) It was around midday now and the beaches started filling up. To get to the beach from the main toad you have to walk down this alleyways and so lots of people started walking past us. We didn’t even think it was weird to be lying in the middle of the toad just chatting and laughing. I remeber one Moment when someone’s dog came to play with me and I just let it jump all over me. A lot happened and it was the most intense trip of my life but I’m fast foreward to a few hours later when we decided we had sobered up and wanted to smoke some weed cause it was a nice hot day and it sounded nice. We went to the girls house and got her HUGE purple bong and some weed and then went back to the alleyway. There was one house that looked very abandoned but the light was on and for some dumb reason we just went straight in anyways. We sat in the garden and you could see us clearly when walking through the alleyway. Obviously, we were not sober or back to normal at all but just thought we were. We filled the bong up with some really gross drainage water and got insanely high. Now it was sunset and loads of people were walking past. We didn’t care at all but suddenly one family walked past and we just ran away to hide behind the house becyase they seemed scary. I peered around the wall and I remember seeing three children each with one adult standing behind them, like they were in formation to attack us. This family just saw my face peek around the corner and then we all three ran away in the opposite direction. The only problem was I had left my bag with everything in it at the house so we had to do a loop and come back. I went to fetch my bag and there was a man on the phone in the garden reporting us but he was facing the other way so I grabbed my bag and ran as fast as I could. I was scared shitless but actually not as scared as I should have been. I was 15. I could have been expelled and literally killed by my parents.

some of the best nights of my life have been on drugs, but i can’t ignore that just a few years of casual use has already put me down thousands of dollars and had a generally negative impact on the way i feel most days.

when it comes to using drugs i know that my best experiences are behind me. every day lately i’ve spent high and doing fuck all is a day i could have been studying, working out, saving money.

i’ve decided the lifestyle continuing to use drugs will inevitably lead me to is incompatible with the man i want to become. if i want to be proud of the person i am in 5 or 10 years, i need to stop while i’m ahead.

I also thought my other dealer broke into my home and put cameras in my room and made crack in my microwave, made meth in my sink, made a meth lab underneath house, and made meth in our cave area in my house in a sandbox in the corner. I found opium seeds as well and almost accused him of making heroin and.fentanyl and spiking my meth he sold me with fentanyl and that the weed he gave me was synthetic weed..took all the lightswtiches off in my room, the mirrors and panicked thinking he was watching me from my phone.. I then accused him of ""knowing what I was talking about and to admit what he had done.

My various drug induced delirium where I would freak the fuck out and call 911 on myself and 30 cops and ambulances and paramedics would show up to the house at 3 am and I would be running into my neighbor's homes half naked crying and screaming.

I thought I had fallen in love with this guy and he essentially raped me and came inside me bareback and he had hiv he told me a day after and I freaked the fuck out and was late to work and he ubered me to the er and me there crying and I thought he was my boyfriend and I got on hiv pep meds and luckily didn't contract it.

I escorted on day 7 or 8 awake and I thought the psychiatrist LOL I fucked for a great amount of money was so amazing and so kind despite being a gross fart and I said I loved his husky pup plushie in his 5 star hotel and he gave it to me and I thought there was a camera in it.. he even gave me some fuckin amphetamines for the comedown I KID YOU NOT I accused him of being on meth he said nah he snorted some pills amphs instead LOL and he gave someto me. They got me spun af on top of the meth on day 7 or 8 awake just in time to fulfill my adult responsibilities for the day.

This guy I'd hung out with I thought he was going to try take murder me.

I thought I had mouth cancer for seeing a ""weird color"" on a tiny part of my gums and the dentists all looked at me like I was psycho (because I was) when I went to emergency dental

I saw dead bodies and people getting murdered and someone hang themselves and dead people in this other guys vents at his house and had sex with his totally disgusting ass for money and to him for his meth 🤮🤮

Not to mention the many er trips where I thought. was having a stroke or had a serious illness.

Thinking my landlord was going to hurt me and someone was going to rape me.

Hi. Yesterday I got mdma crystal that came out to be fake so I threw it out, but then I got myself xtc from a trusted friend (not tested). My last roll was on May 10th and I was really looking forward to my next experience. I started peaking 30 min from swallowing and first hour was just awesome. I was so blissed and had great talk that helped me get over some problems. Unfortunately after 1 hour this feeling stopped. I didn’t even had a comedown. I felt like I was suddenly sober. Then I smoked a bit of pot and it didn’t even got me high. Also I had really bulging eyes. Definitely more than I would have expected after m. Does it sound like it wasn’t mdma?

I’ve been on a drug diversion program through the courts in Wisconsin for about 9 months, today was supposed to be my last day, but the last time I went I tested positive for benzos. The only one I used was etizolam a few times because I have awful anxiety sometimes. My question is this: could I possibly challenge this test or nearly outright admit it was etizolam and argue it was fine to take once or twice due to in being unscheduled federally and in my state? If not, I WAS once single time prescribed Ativan a little under two years ago. On the phone with DA’s office I claimed I had a few of those lying around for a long time that I avoided because I didn’t need them but did use recently. I’m going through a painful process of trying to get the prescription archives to prove this, but then would they be able to tell it tested for etizolam rather than lorazepam?

Kids were on vacation for a week. I was spending the evening with friends.
A. said : *you seem ready for your first molly. How about tonight ?*
And ready I was. Ready and in the hands of the best friends I could ever wish for.

Took it late. Not an heroic dose but more than I should for my weight and overall tolerance. 
It was cold so ignite a fire in the fireplace when the effects kicks in.

Phase 1 The build up

My ears start buzzing and I'm suddenly feeling like I'm in a box full of cottonballs. I sit down on the couch in front of the fire. I feel warm in the back of my head like my brain was melting down my spine. The warm is like a radiation. This is the only moment were I would feel anxious. I didn't expect the overwelming, the suddenty and the force.
I focus on repeating myself this is the experience I've choose that there is no turning back and this is a wave I must ride.
The anxiety left and I enter :

Phase 2 mindblow

My vision start to vibrate. The color are brighter. And waves of pleasure are hitting me.
I can't move, barely speak. I'm moaning, grunting with pleasure. Never ending Ohhhh, ahhhhh and fuuuuuuck ! 
Friends are asking me questions. 

Are you climaxing cause you sound like it ? What do you see ? Are you cold ? You seem thristy.

They are taking such good care of me I feel so loved. 
J. is pouring water in my mouth each time I manage to mumble *thriiisty* 
I ear K and F stating * oh my god it seems so awsome she's having the time of her life* and then both took half a dose to join me.

Phase 3 sharing

After an hour or so of pure pleasure I manage to move again and to share with people around.
The lights are colorfull and it's like people have their own colored auras. K and F are gold. J is bright green. A is grayish blue. My SO Who's next to me is worried and not sharing the euphoria at all. I see him red and distorded. *you're scary honey I'm not looking to you anymore* 

I feel J's knee touching my knee and began a knee obsession. I caress every knee I can. They are so soft. Then it's beards. J's beard. A's beard. So much variety of beards from fluffy to scratchy. It's heaven to touch.

Then I realize they are my friends and I can't tell what color are their eyes so I spend one by one time to look them in their eyes. Enjoying the colors and the connections. It's amazing looking in each others eyes without beeing embarassed or self aware. Just drowning info the feeling of connection and love.

Phase 3 : the goodbyes 

K is stating she have to poop and I feel connected to her needs thinking she will have the greatest poop in her life. But it's time to go home now. My jaw is clenching and my cheeks bleeding on the inside. I don't want to go. I just want to curl up with my friends into a giant ball of cuddle and sleep by their side.

The way to the car is like walking through a desert cause I'm Alone and craving for touch.

On the backseat we reconnect. Kissing and caressing each other hair and hands. It's not sexual, it's love in it's purest form.

But the ride is short. I'm soon home. I lay down in my bed and keeps enjoying this heaven touch by petting my cats and caressing my SO.

The sun is rising and I ear Kte Bush singing. I think a radio must have been left on but it's the birds outside. They are singing and my expanded mind is hearing Kate Bush.

Phase 4 : the following week

A. checked on me every day for the following week. My friends cared all the way through. The comedown I've been warned about  didn't came. I had an afterglow for 5 days. Feeling connected with the world itself. I've enjoyed 10 days straight without any anxiety, the first time in over 5 years.

It was so mind opening and life changing. It helped me reconnect and opened my eyes. Since I'm more caring about myself and trying my best to overcome my problems.

I never thought my own ADHD (if I even have it) was too much of a problem besides when it came to schooling, so I never pursued any medication for it. Yesterday afternoon I tried an Amphetamine the same friend gave me though to see if it would actually help, but I do not know what it was, only that the dosage was either 25 or 50 mg.

When it first kicked in I did not notice it much, but I started feeling more focused and better about myself. I felt like the pill actually helped me a lot not only with ADHD, but my anxiety as well. If I talked to someone or simply was around people, I felt more purposeful, in the way that I was more confident about what I did and not overthinking anything at all (besides how much the pill is affecting me). I read half of a novel as well, and gamed intensely in which I have never done so good in my life haha. I was very focused and felt like I could accomplish a lot, but mainly small tasks. I attempted to clean my room but it felt like too big of a job when I picked up a piece of clothing lmao. Instead I intensely focused on small things, being aware of how precise I was being and how much extra time I would pay attention to something I was doing than normal.

I noticed it felt like I had something in my throat though (I made sure to take deep breaths regularly and such to ensure I wasn't losing breath and going to be surprisingly deathly allergic to the pill). I felt relatively normal until I tried to eat and felt exhausted yet not tired around the 10 hour mark. When I tried to eat a sandwich, for some reason the roof of my mouth burned, finishing chewing what I had bitten was terrible, yet when I tried it again within a couple minutes it felt better. I started sweating from just my left armpit as well, weirdly enough. Now I have been up all night but am worried how I am going to feel after sleeping, or worried ill sleep for super long as I need to be up in \~6 hours.

It's both a dopamine releaser and uptake inhibitor. 

Ritalin is only a uptake inhibitor. 

If you need to study just use 5-10mg of ritalin (gets the concentration job done). No need to do stupid pleasure binges like MDMA + Aderall + Weed + Porn in your dorm room. I got out fine moneywise, reputation wise and health wise but 

I have come to the strong belief that you don't want to daily ANY drug. Reason is core life is so good/beautiful once you start working on what you know you need to.

I have about 1.3 g of wax on me, some booze a .5 benzo and cigs. All of which at the point of writing this will fuck my good energy up if I dont jump into other sober endeavors.

Young soul who reads me. All drug types are ok, you just need to be in a place where you can look back at the last time you popped that pill and say ""haven't had perkies in 8 months"" 

In other words, to be in good standing with drugs means to not only not have tolerance or traces in your body. IT HAS TO BE GO OUT OF THE PLACE IT RECIDES IN YOUR MIND.

I would have to stop looking at coffe for energy, at weed for escape/enhancement and cigs for fidgeting/pleasure/concentration

About a week ago i decided to meet up with me friend who had just got a hold of some 5-meo-dmt. (ill just refer to it as dmt now although the two are quite different) we went into a forest and sat down in a clearing and got a friend to help us both light up. We both took about 50mg each.

I was scared at first, but when i took the first hit, it felt familiar, gave me this almost nostalgic feeling. I look up at the trees and they reach out to grab me. I felt myself trying to fight it but i knew that was just gonna lead to a bad trip. I took another big hit and my body got super heavy to the point i could barely move. I looked up and laid back and i felt myself leave my body, like i was floating one or two feet above it. The tree branches are reaching out to each other and wrapping around my head making these impossible patterns and the sun shining through the leaves made for a beautiful sight, kind of like looking through stained glass. I closed my eyes and then i felt myself being shot up into this bright light with this figure watching over me in the distance. I didnt quite make it there but i could feel that i was right about to.

The trip only lasted 5 mins which was disappointing to me, but i heard that weed can bring back psychedelic trips on lsd and shrooms, so why not try with dmt?

I take rips from my friends bong until i cant breathe anymore and i feel myself getting stoned. I look up to see if the patterns i was seeing were back and they were, although slightly different this time. I was holding my water bottle and it started slipping through my hands. I thought the bottle was a part of my arm and i felt it falling off and hitting the ground and thats when i knew i was fucked up good. I had no money on me so the only way to get home was to walk my bike, which would take almost an hour, so i left early to try to get home so i could lie down.

I was able to get on my bike and it was surprisingly easy to use as i felt the bike become an extension of my body. On the way home i felt my ego being ripped apart and i couldnt feel any of my body normally except for part of my head. The whole time i felt like i was being stretched outward and being pulled apart. All the while my vision was changing colors and flipping upside down and everything. I almost ran into a pole because i saw it as something far in the distance but then all of a sudden it jumped really close.

I got home safely but my head was throbbing and i felt like it was building up to something but i didnt know what. When i got to my bed i lied down and my vision went all black and i threw up. I spent the rest of the trip lying down listening to music and it was actually good at that point. I did end up feeling nauseous for the next few days though.

I think i can safely say this is my last time doing drugs. This really showed me how precious my life really is and how i almost lost it just then.

What do you think is the best drug for this rare use? I will limit it to this events only. Not everyday use. I don't suffer from any addiction and had never any problems.

I'm a daily oxy user right now upwards of 210 mg - 300 mg or more a day. I took some 30's throughout the day today. 2-3 in the morning, one in the afternoon, another in the evening and I think one more at night. At night I wasn't very high or anything so I tried some Xanax I had recently bought. I think I had 1mg then later .5 ( I just looked up the bar now I thought it was a 1mg bar not 2mg). I had forgotten I took those and decided to boof 3 30's (first time I ever boofed that much). When I remembered all this I started to get a little worried. Both are respiratory depressants that cause a risk of death especially when combined. As far as I can tell the only risk is due to slowing down your respiration (is this correct that that is the only danger?). After realizing this I started feeling a little wonky (partially due to anxiety). I've def feeling slow and tired and occasionally closing my eyes for a second before opening them. Weird for me because taking oxy always gives me energy. Any ways I'm curious to see if you guys think I'm at any risk. Can you die from respiratory depression without falling asleep? What about heart rate? My fitbit shows I'm at 82 bpm. Would this also have to go pretty low to risk death? Would someone in my situation or potentially worse be fine as long as they are awake?

I have thoughts about my boyfriend cheating, leaving me, me losing my job, losing my family, etc. I mean, which is completely so far out there because nothing would indicate that any of that will happen.

I only felt a little trembling on my hands, I could walk fine, I laughed easily tho so I was sure it had hit me at least a little. My friend went to sleep shortly after smokin so I also did, I put on some music and I remember at a specific part  of the song I just felt it in a different way, the voice of the singer felt so pleasent in my ears (idk how else to explain it).

Marquis Test Kits

Sometimes, the result of your Ehrlich test kit may indicate that there is very little or no LSD present in your sample. If that happens, you have the option of tossing it out or investigating to find out what it is. Even if the Ehrlich shows the presence of LSD, this doesn’t mean that there aren’t other substances mixed in, as well. That’s where the other tests come in.

Just because a Marquis test kit isn’t helpful for detecting LSD doesn’t mean it’s not helpful for continued testing of your sample. You can use it to look for the presence of MDMA-type chemicals, as well as MDPV, DXM, 2C-B, and speed. This is helpful in knowing what effects to expect when you ingest the substance, as well as avoiding potentially dangerous or deadly effects or interactions.


Mecke Test Kits

Next in the LSD test kit lineup is the Mecke test. This one will react to the presence of opiates. It will also let you know if your sample contains 2c-T-x compounds, as well as showing significantly different results between DXM and MDMA-like substances (the Marquis test turns the same color for both). While opiates and MDMA are used as recreational drugs, their effects are quite different than those of LSD. Identifying their presence in a sample can better help you decide whether to take it or toss it out.


Mandelin Test Kits

Still not sure what’s in your sample? The Mandelin test kit will tell you if it contains the dangerous adulterants PMA or PMAA. The Mandelin testing fluid will also change colors if your sample contains amphetamines, specific opiates, MDxx, and 2C-type chemicals. Like the Marquis and Mecke tests, the Mandelin test is not helpful in testing for LSD but should be used to rule out or confirm the presence of other substances.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,695829,public,confidence,self,Further Testing Your Psychedelic Substances: Marquis/Mecke/Mandelin Test Kits &amp; Uses,0,[],0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hvn6xb/further_testing_your_psychedelic_substances/,no_ads,0.0,1595421120.0,b9d528e2-728a-11e9-b389-0e9820bd770e,Harm Reduction,,Custom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was an amazing trip, not at all what i expected. 

I have done acid a few times before and was expecting it to be similar, but i was wrong in the best way possible. 

The euphoria was fucking amazing and the visuals were insane. I sat outside staring at flowers on my porch forever because they looked extraordinary. 

After that, i went in my yard and sat in the grass. I thought about how I was sexually assaulted &amp; how i’ve been blaming myself for it. I realized then that it wasn’t my fault and it’s just something i need to learn to move past, rather than bury it like i’d been doing. 

My thing is though, today i feel very disconnected. Not necessarily numb, because my sober self usually feels that way, just weird. 

I’ve read somewhere that sometimes after shrooms, people go into a state of derealization. It doesn’t seem like it’s that extreme, though. The best way i can describe the feeling is just ‘off’. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Is it just because my perception was so altered that i need to gain some footing again? Or because i confronted one of my traumas? I’m just really confused and looking for some answers.

Naturally my doctor solved this with every stim he could throw at me, until the house of psychopharmaceutical cards collapsed... so he resorted to max-dose fast-release Adderall. I had the maximum allowable dose according to DEA prescribing guidelines (hovering around 100mg a day, some months going up to 120).\n\n.\n\nQue my brain getting permafucked with the max dose of amphetamines for over one decade. I probably would have a more functional brain if the morons prescribers wrote me a script for anti depressants, or kept the amph dosage reasonable, or even chemo drugs. I was too young to know how they would affect my brain long term. \n\n##B) 8 months ago\n\nI had my blood pressure checked last refill b/c I need lab work monthly for such a high dosage to make sure it is in my system and I'm not dealing... it was 192 over almostdead... they still gave me my script after I used some breathing techniques to lower my blood pressure.   \n\n192 diastolic is when I decided to get the fuck off adderall. \n\nI went through my RX bottle as slowly as possible, and eventually quit my prescription within one bottle: 120 30mg IR per month. \n\n##C) 6 months ago: Aftermath of Quitting max-dose Amphetamines\n\nI quit my research job in a coveted medical AI laboratory developing models for extremely early cancer detection. Flat out, misspelled my co-publisher's name and didn't even give a shit to correct it... hard cringe, so much regret. We were a few months left from publishing... \n\n\nMy grand point with this self aggrandizing and borderline narcissistic post is that I function at a very high level on stimulants, but they've fucked my brain hard. See more immediately below.\n\n\n##D.0) Hypothesis\n\nMy hypothesis is my natural dopaminergic reward system has shut down significantly (idk... 80%+??) because I've been on amphetamines since I could do basic math. Why do I posit my brain being fucked in this way?\n\n##D.1) Limited Evidence to Back Hypothesis\n\nWithout my meds I can't do the following...\n\n* I barely have the motivation to get out of bed, it feels like I'm fucking 85 years old without meds, even months after cessation.\n* Lost motivation to talk to my friends for many months\n* Emotionally shut down and stopped talking to my girlfriend who I live with, this almost destroyed our relationship until I explained what was happening.\n* Lost motivation for my hobbies. \n* Most damningly my neurologist said it was likely to happen and I would need to be on them for the rest of my life. Too little too late, I appreciated his honesty though.\n\n ##E) METH\n\nI got a prescription for desoxyn (meth), took two yesterday and I felt normal for the first time in as long as can remember. Kept on taking them throughout the night to finish a cost estimate for a project at my job -- also throughout the day to stay awake and get shit done, which I did. Who am I kidding, I got high but not very high, riding the edge of functionality and pleasure.\n\n\nLet me just say, better than addy for my ADD, way less body load! But also holy mother fucking one-man one-jar mother Theresa's asshole... the comedown 36 hours later is rocking me pretty hard. I get why this shit is so addictive, although I probably experience it differently than most of you for better or worse. \n\nMy mind was tearing itself apart, so much self judgment, external judgment, anger, sadness, pain, feeling alone. I realized what was happening when I started arguing about pointless bullshit, tried to stick it out but didn't want to do it without helper meds.\n\nThe comedown started about 2.5hr before I started typing this post and I just had to put an end to it before I said something really stupid to my GF. I was thinking completely irrationally, but I was aware it was irrational, it was bizarre. I popped 2mg of Xanax, and that took the edge off, it has fully set in now and I can think clearly again; **that was a fun ride -- even for someone who grew up traveling with the carnies**. Still pretty chatty, but i guess that is a side effect? Worth it. Despite the brutal comedown I'll stay on desoxyn (meth) for as long as it benefits myself and those around me, and my pdoc hooks me up.

Naturally my doctor solved this with every stim he could throw at me, until the house of psychopharmaceutical cards collapsed... so he resorted to max-dose fast-release Adderall. I had the maximum allowable dose according to DEA prescribing guidelines (hovering around 100mg a day, some months going up to 120).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Que my brain getting permafucked with the max dose of amphetamines for over one decade. I probably would have a more functional brain if the morons prescribers wrote me a script for anti depressants, or kept the amph dosage reasonable, or even chemo drugs. I was too young to know how they would affect my brain long term. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;B) 8 months ago&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had my blood pressure checked last refill b/c I need lab work monthly for such a high dosage to make sure it is in my system and I&amp;#39;m not dealing... it was 192 over almostdead... they still gave me my script after I used some breathing techniques to lower my blood pressure.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;192 diastolic is when I decided to get the fuck off adderall. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went through my RX bottle as slowly as possible, and eventually quit my prescription within one bottle: 120 30mg IR per month. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;C) 6 months ago: Aftermath of Quitting max-dose Amphetamines&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quit my research job in a coveted medical AI laboratory developing models for extremely early cancer detection. Flat out, misspelled my co-publisher&amp;#39;s name and didn&amp;#39;t even give a shit to correct it... hard cringe, so much regret. We were a few months left from publishing... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My grand point with this self aggrandizing and borderline narcissistic post is that I function at a very high level on stimulants, but they&amp;#39;ve fucked my brain hard. See more immediately below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;D.0) Hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My hypothesis is my natural dopaminergic reward system has shut down significantly (idk... 80%+??) because I&amp;#39;ve been on amphetamines since I could do basic math. Why do I posit my brain being fucked in this way?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;D.1) Limited Evidence to Back Hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without my meds I can&amp;#39;t do the following...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I barely have the motivation to get out of bed, it feels like I&amp;#39;m fucking 85 years old without meds, even months after cessation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lost motivation to talk to my friends for many months&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Emotionally shut down and stopped talking to my girlfriend who I live with, this almost destroyed our relationship until I explained what was happening.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lost motivation for my hobbies. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most damningly my neurologist said it was likely to happen and I would need to be on them for the rest of my life. Too little too late, I appreciated his honesty though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;E) METH&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a prescription for desoxyn (meth), took two yesterday and I felt normal for the first time in as long as can remember. Kept on taking them throughout the night to finish a cost estimate for a project at my job -- also throughout the day to stay awake and get shit done, which I did. Who am I kidding, I got high but not very high, riding the edge of functionality and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me just say, better than addy for my ADD, way less body load! But also holy mother fucking one-man one-jar mother Theresa&amp;#39;s asshole... the comedown 36 hours later is rocking me pretty hard. I get why this shit is so addictive, although I probably experience it differently than most of you for better or worse. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My mind was tearing itself apart, so much self judgment, external judgment, anger, sadness, pain, feeling alone. I realized what was happening when I started arguing about pointless bullshit, tried to stick it out but didn&amp;#39;t want to do it without helper meds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The comedown started about 2.5hr before I started typing this post and I just had to put an end to it before I said something really stupid to my GF. I was thinking completely irrationally, but I was aware it was irrational, it was bizarre. I popped 2mg of Xanax, and that took the edge off, it has fully set in now and I can think clearly again; &lt;strong&gt;that was a fun ride -- even for someone who grew up traveling with the carnies&lt;/strong&gt;. Still pretty chatty, but i guess that is a side effect? Worth it. Despite the brutal comedown I&amp;#39;ll stay on desoxyn (meth) for as long as it benefits myself and those around me, and my pdoc hooks me up. I&amp;#39;ve never and will never shoot or smoke it, definitely not for me, but no judgement here... I&amp;#39;m actually envious, if I had less to live for I would def go that ROA.

So my dad is typically a really chill dude but lately he’s been acting hella odd. He’s been mad alert and reacts to things like right when that shit happens. He’s been a lot more shaky than usual and also talks, moves, and does stuff faster. He’s been pretty fidgety and seems unable to stay still. He hasn’t been like that for my Whole life. Yesterday in the car he was itching like hell and jerking a little bit. Today we were messing with some SIM card shit and he tried to put the fucking sim tray in the volume tab. Dude knows hella shit about phones and would never do that. His sentences seem really confused too. We had company over today and some kid kept asking where in my car I’m putting something and my dad replied by telling him the fuckin city I’m going to. 

I moved here with him in December and noticed this behavior a few months in, but just yesterday i really decided to think about it. I really hope you guys can help. This is scary for me because at times it’s like he’s not even himself anymore and I hope you guys can help identify if this is some drug shit or nah. 

I’m a cannabis user and I’ve used a few hallucinogenics, I’m not someone here to shame drug use. But I think there’s a time and place depending on the substance. And I also feel some just shouldn’t be used in my opinion.

I weighed out 2.5 grams at about 1 pm and within an hour I was having a nice trip while watching a summer rainstorm through my window. I decided to smoke a joint so I stepped outside and lit up what I had rolled earlier. About halfway through the joint I was extremely euphoric and having some intense thoughts when suddenly I collapsed from pain on my right side. At first I thought I might have eaten some poisoned mushrooms so I was freaking out a little bit while still rolling around on the porch. I somehow crawled my way back in and preceded to lay on my bathroom floor in agony for the next 3-4 hours. I had a lot of intense thoughts and honestly felt sooo grateful that I don’t have long term debilitating pain like many people do- it sounds stupid but I felt like my body was cleansing out years of built up poison in my kidneys and mind. I finally passed it at about 7:30 pm and I’m feeling so much better mentally and physically now. It was absolutely awful pain but honestly not the worst trip I’ve had.

From 15-18 it never appeared to present any long term effects and I quite enjoyed all aspects of it. It enabled me to be more sociable and I always felt upbeat, productive and rarely down. 

When I started uni I picked up the habit once again but this time my usage was more excessive. Me and my mate would smoke zoots and hit bongs all day everyday and I slowly started to realise the destructive potential of this drug. This stage lasted about a year before in winter 2019 everything began to take its toll. I was smoking a couple grams a day, sometimes more but by this point I’d stopped with the bongs as I found they started to mess with my head. I was starting to struggle with focussing, was overthinking everything, struggled to sleep and my sex drive was almost nil. 

In December 19 I decided to seek some medical help as I hadn’t been feeling myself and I was starting to have negative thoughts on a regular basis. They offered counselling/ antidepressants but I thought I would just try and cut down myself and hope that I’d feel better. Throughout winter break I managed not to smoke and the doctors visit seemed to have helped put some positivity back into my life. 

2020- managed to not smoke anything for all of January and most of Feb. However, COVID-19 crept up on us and lockdown was in place. So what better way to pass the time than to get back on it.. right? 

Wrong! I was smoking more than before and it soon started to take its toll. I was getting more sleep and wasn’t dreaming anymore. I was sleeping in until late into afternoon and just didn’t really fancy getting up. I knew I needed to sort myself out. I was distancing myself from my family and was being much less productive. 

In May 2020 one of my mates moved into my house and he’d recently given up smoking weed for medical reasons. He’d said he felt much better and I kinda saw this as an opportunity to get off the stuff myself. Safe to say I have cut down dramatically and am now feeling much more positive about everything. Remember to always use the people around you for support, and if you feel like you’re falling, ask for help. 

The point is Marijuana can be positive in small doses as I’ve now learned but can also be incredibly destructive in larger ones. It’s all about moderating usage.

And maybe I have just happened to see a lot of trip reports and posts/comments like this, and it isn't really representative of the majority of hallucinogen users online. But I have just seen so many people talk about their experience with ""ego death"" and then go on to describe something that isn't that at all.

One of the most common ones I see are people who say that they ""felt like they were dying"" and called it ""ego death"". Or just a really crazy psychedelic experience that enveloped all of their senses. These things and ego death are not mutually exclusive, but an overwhelming trip or the sensation that you are dying is not the same thing as ego death.

Ego death at it's most basic definition is the loss of yourself, or to phrase it better losing the awareness of yourself and your ego. This is a state where you don't know who or what you are, and even the concept of ""I"" has gone beyond you. Many people do report that they feel like they are dying right before this occurs (and often the transition between that sensation and ego death actually may feel like a death), but that in itself is not ego death.  

Often times, it is not some big dramatic process or transition at all. Especially with fast hitting and powerful psyches like DMT, you might just be here one minute and gone the next. But if you are aware of yourself and who you are, it isn't ego death: you're just tripping really fucking hard. Ego death is an experience caused by the trip, and while it's most likely to occur at higher doses it's not a level of intensity of the experience (like some people ascribe plateau levels to dissos), but rather a possible effect of that experience (like synesthesia). It's possible to take a higher dose than someone else, and yet that person will be the one to experience ego death instead. 

I just keep seeing people who seem to think ego death means something else. Not even just here, I've seen it be described in documentaries by people who seemingly misunderstood what it even is. I just felt like posting this to clear it up a bit. The fact that someone didn't completely lose awareness of themselves doesn't by any means take away from how intense, powerful, and overwhelming the experience was for them.

I heard about this drug a few years ago called adrenochrome which has seemingly gained some sort of mythical aura around it and have recently heard about it again.

I read an essay about this drug by the author Adous Huxley called 'The Doors Of Perception' and whilst he mainly talks about his experiences with compounds such as mescaline, he briefly mentions how adrenochrome could potentially produce psychedelic effects much like the ""psychedelic cactus"".

As i searched more  i found a book by Adam Gottlieb called 'Legal Highs' where he mentions it is ""physically stimulating"" and produces ""a feeling of well-being"".

With that being said, my questions are: is Adrenochrome even real as a potential drug? How could you ingest a substance like that? What are the effects of Adrenochrome? Finally, why is there some sort of mythical stigma around the drug such as how it comes from tortured children for the world's elite?

I know Adrenochrome is simply a product of the decomposition of adrenaline so surely it cant even really be ethically possible to gather such a substance without it being synthesised in a lab.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,695789,public,confidence,self,Questions about Adrenochrome (C₉H₉NO₃ ),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hvj5kf/questions_about_adrenochrome_c₉h₉no₃/,no_ads,0.0,1595405362.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All my friends are pushing me to stay awake but I’m at a table, head down, telling my friends that I’m just “resting my eyes”. They grab one of our coworkers who puts a key near my face and told me to sniff. It kept me up for the extra 20 minutes it took for the bar to close and to get to my friends house where I so happily fell asleep.

It has been three days since I rolled, yet I'm feeling fine. In fact, I believe I've lost  around 90% of my neuroticism. 

My anxiety has brought me down to my knees in the past — that horribly tight feeling of coiling doom in your chest — a sinking chill in your guts. It happened in conjunction with ""difficult"" social situations. Stuff like calling someone you don't know very well (or worse, answering one) or having an argument. I understand that it's normal to experience some discomfort, but when my anxiety was triggered, I couldn't do anything productive that day. The feeling would distract me from whatever I was doing and bring me back to whatever caused it. Sometimes it even came for no reason (usually, but not always, elated to an upset stomach). 

So, I took some molly at this outdoor rave three days ago. I knew what I had was potent and had suffered the consequences of abuse once before, so I decided to split it and leave the rest to my friend for safe keeping. Fifty minutes later and I'm walking on clouds, blanketed in a fuzzy love buzz and that warm acceptance that only a rave can provide. When I wasn't dancing, I took respite by our blanket along the wood's edge. A guy sitting next to us tripped on shrooms, LSD, and ecstacy, constantly puffing on a spliff. As you can imagine, he wasn't particularly greedy. Four hours goes by and I'm feeling great. My friend wouldn't give me my second dose (bless him) because he was getting tired and I'd instructed him to call the shots when I was sober. I gave up without much struggle. Unlike my two earlier experiences with the substance, coming down was a pleasant experience. Whether that was due to the weed or the dancing (I wasn't moving around nearly as much my first two times) I don't know. We went home with dawn on our backs, and that was that. 

Now to the meat of it. The days following the rave has been great. My mind cringe in situations which would have triggered my anxiety in the past, preparing for the wave, but right when it's supposed to kick in, there's a slight twinge below my solar plexus, and . . . Nothing. Nothing at all. The same fears are there and the problem remains unchanged, but the feeling is pretty much gone. Just like the sensation of anxiety blew my problems way out of proportion, the lack of it minimize them. I haven't pushed it yet, but I'm sure planning to! The only times I've felt anxiety resembling anything near what it was, is in relation with bad bowel movements (I've got chronic diarrhoea.) 

I've read about the afterglow effect, but come on, it can't be this good. How could depleting my dopamine stores possibly improve my mental health, or even better, solve a chronic issue? Especially when you consider the fact that I've taken it before. Have anyone of you experienced/heard of anything similar in the past? Does the ""glow"" eventually pass, or has molly permanently improved your lives for the better? 

Also, music sounds better now. I've been straying away from my usual genres of folk and metal towards bass heavy ones like rap and psy-trance, dancing and singing along (something I haven't enjoyed as much before)",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,695773,public,confidence,self,Ecstasy eliminated my neuroticism,0,[],0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hvho3k/ecstasy_eliminated_my_neuroticism/,no_ads,0.0,1595400148.0,9469b226-728a-11e9-b0d5-0ebd9c4fbbf8,Long Post,,Custom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But from all I've been reading, I only hear unpleasant experiences, Psychonaut even has a warning header about the experience being mostly unpleasant.

So I wanted to ask, those that have used deliriants multiple times, what do you like about it? What keeps you coming back? Why is it labelled as an ""Unpleasant Experience"" for most but not for you?

Well lads... Let me tell you. The other day I went to an organised smoke up event put together by some local activists in the city where I live (I live in an illegal country). It was a great time, loads of different kinds of people, all ages and walks of life smoking doobs in the park listening to some live music and the occasional talk about prohibition and moving forward. At this point I was two joints and a couple of small bowls in and one of the event organisers gave me a bag of medicated popcorn on his way out saying ""here you go lad, Im way too high to need the rest of this"". I shared a bit of it with my girlfriend and friends who treaded lightly but for the most part I ate a majority of it myself...

I did not go gentle into that goodnight.

I was fine for the first while, walked home got some food on the way no bother. Then when I sat on my couch the demons came out. I let my girlfriend know not to freak out if I become unresponsive that ""Im just on the brink of blasting off into DMT world"". She calmly continued to watch Marco Polo on the projector as I tunnelled backwards through space at a million miles an hour. Unable to alter the course of my astronomical voyage I gripped the couch for dear life and held on for all it was worth.

The walls felt like they were closing in and Im sure I looked like one of the people in those salvia smoking videos that keep backwards crawling up the couch and eventually out an open window. Thankfully there were no windows behind me, only an infinite freefall into my deepest fears and paranoia. Were not in Kansas anymore, I thought as I took a good look at myself, the once confident stoner with a high tolerance reduced to a pile of mushy human parts with some vague sense of sentience. I went to bed early that night thinking that sleep would mimic the sweet grip of death and take me away from my living nightmare but I was wrong. I kept waking up in the middle of the night to restart the rounds of feeble attempts at getting the room to stop spinning.

As I finally drifted off I thanked the weed Gods for putting me in my place, as an overly confident stoner of over 6 years it had been a while since the last time I went too far and I was beginning to think it was impossible. Happy to see that I was proven wrong, it had been too long since my last reminder that there is always a more intense high out there that I want nothing to do with. Thank you weed gods, I promise Ill be a good boy and I will do my best to not be such a silly goose in the future.

Met him once at the hospital. My dad had alco problems before and 3 out of 4 of my uncles do have drinking problems / heart issues.

Whats somewhat safe and whats not so safe? Any insight is good.

Stay safe, and have fun.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Very important, my bro has a case of anxiety / social panic syndrome , i don't know, hes not anti social hes the opposite but he has like this adhd like panic where a lot of people can irritate / anger him. Example: he can go to a party no problem and he will love it but he hasn't used the public transport in like 5 years unless he was forced to travel somewhere. Hes on some form of medication i don't remember the name but I'm pretty sure they are SSRI's. Will they affect him in any way? He wont take them before and after the rave but gotta be safe right?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,695722,public,confidence,self,Nitrous x Weed x other combo?,0,[],0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hvax67/nitrous_x_weed_x_other_combo/,no_ads,0.0,1595378904.0,14240396-9da9-11e5-9ca6-0e5d32eec499,Combo Drugs,,Custom,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': '7W1ZcenFLTbl8eWc7f--nlqPk02UVDTQ9A7_4InQLgE', 'resolutions': [{'height': 44, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3LfPn_P9E5sWIbxadV0g80H-cuu4yq8Dgdwdf75Peiw.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a29d3b27e0a1eb09a27f2b110f86863bdd4fe1d3', 'width': 108}, {'height': 89, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3LfPn_P9E5sWIbxadV0g80H-cuu4yq8Dgdwdf75Peiw.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f39a9f7b169a6285a70daa962aa14afcef6159a', 'width': 216}, {'height': 132, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3LfPn_P9E5sWIbxadV0g80H-cuu4yq8Dgdwdf75Peiw.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=464ec58bd64f3c8fb55b89e88414bc7fdcc8652e', 'width': 320}, {'height': 265, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3LfPn_P9E5sWIbxadV0g80H-cuu4yq8Dgdwdf75Peiw.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88033f7a24016a876f472ec99b12963e829d763d', 'width': 640}, {'height': 397, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3LfPn_P9E5sWIbxadV0g80H-cuu4yq8Dgdwdf75Peiw.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47918dcffdd8a84ac897722869340110d7c10472', 'width': 960}, {'height': 447, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3LfPn_P9E5sWIbxadV0g80H-cuu4yq8Dgdwdf75Peiw.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04bc7ca056aab03abedfafa3d141f7ffb191e96e', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 1575, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/3LfPn_P9E5sWIbxadV0g80H-cuu4yq8Dgdwdf75Peiw.png?auto=webp&amp;s=307d715f2083f6af5b7c88011838fb62b048c243', 'width': 3800}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,1595351910.0,

So I'll give a little back story before I ask the question so you understand why I'm worried. I stopped smoking weed around two years ago, it was damaging my mental health so much (I was 16) that my dad noticed, he has always been very strict with drugs, he doesn't care about alcohol or tobacco tho, but he doesn't allow any other drugs. When he found out I was doing weed he was so dissapointed and stopped trusting me, also it was very hard for me to get better mentally after I stopped smoking. The thing is I haven't smoked for two years (occasionally I have given a few puffs to one but very ocasionally).

Right now I'm in a country house with a lot of friends that smoke, and I have smoked a bit, like 7 drag offs, because it's a special occasion. The thing is with all this covid thing my dad wants us to get covid tested when I come back from the country house. The question is, am I screwed? I mean, if we get a blood analysis for covid testing, can he also test me for THC or does this appear in the analysis? And how long does THC stay on the blood?

This isn't a post about kids wanting to do drugs and be cool. It's a serious post about addiction and it's dangers. I'll probably miss out on a ton so feel free to discuss it. I don't even do marijuana.


This is something I don't understand at all. Why do people think it's more okay to smoke tobacco and drink alcohol than smoke marijuana?

I brought this up with my mother.
Alcohol:
You can easily drink too much without realising it, and sometimes don't even realise you're drunk so you keep drinking.
Very dangerous for your organs in high volumes
Very addictive. Because of it being glorified by our society, it can easily end up in addiction and really hard to get out of.
Very easy access to.
Filled with sugar that can cause overweight, acne and diabetes.

Marijuana where it's illegal:
Harder than alcohol or tobacco to get hands on.
Harder to consume too much without realising it.
Very dangerous to get via irl dealers due to it not being regulated nor confirmed OK by health professionals.
Will fill up our prisons with unnecessary prisoners that is not a real threat to society.
Has health benefits.
Can lead to harder, more dangerous drugs due to drug dealers pushing more expensive drugs like heroin onto the user.


Conclusion: Marijuana isn't good either, but it's not unhealthy if consumed a few times a week with a controlled amount. Alcohol on the other hand isn't good for our bodies no matter the volume and leads to accidents which hurt others and the user more frequently, like drunk driving.
Both can have negative effects on our bodies, but marijuana can actually have positive effects if ingested properly.

WHY IS ALCOHOL LEGAL BUT NOT MARIJUANA. I don't actually get it. People's life gets ruined by alcohol daily, people get killed by it daily and kills others in the process, but it's never brought up. Only the dangers about marijuana.

I read too many stories on r/suicidewatch by people in the process or wanting to take their life because of their alcohol addiction. I have had multiple family members in that situation as well due to alcohol.

It's probably one of the most dangerous drugs, mostly to it being glorified and such easy access. This is what we need to fix.

I'm taking 70 mg of Vyvanse daily to study and get through the day. Usually I take 35 mg in the morning and another 35 mg in the afternoon, because the whole capsule of 70 mg makes me feel wired and unproductive. This 35+35 regime worked just fine for about 1 year, with me occasionally upping it to 105mg per day when I had to work like 8 am-11 pm.

Recently I had a hard time working on a research project so I started taking more than 1 capsule per day. At first it was 1.5, then 2. Two days ago I literally had to work for 36h straight without sleep, so I took half, after half, after half, resulting in 210mg of Vyvanse in total. Then strange things started to happen.

Usually it takes me 50-65 mins to feel the kick, but these days it kicks TWICE AS FAST, like in 25-30 mins. The overall effect has also changed, I don't really feel the kick anymore, just a focus increase. You could compare it to slowly flooring the gas pedal in your car. A total effect time has also lowered a bit, from about 1h of a good focus down to 40 mins and then I have a crash.

So the question is, what do I do? I've never experienced such symptoms before so I'm open for any suggestions. I can't really make a break right now because I have a couple of exams the next week and a research project deadline, but I'm considering going drugs-free for the whole September.

As a kid I've always thought that I would never do drugs in my life (like most think) because, you know, drugs are evil, but at 16, pretty late compared to the 'standard' for where I live, I started using cannabis and alcohol.
My dilemma is that I'm not sure if I was completely conscious, as if I still was a child thinking and acting more like a child, before those events in my life happened. I know this sounds weird but I really don't how to put it that well, this is also probably the reason why I don't speak about it that much. Anyway, I just feel like my life has changed so much since I've started using drug, first making me conscious about myself and the others around me in ways I had never been before and second by making me live in the outer world instead of the one I thought was my world. They have probably been one of the major influence in my life as I look at my life going through 2 different phases: Pre and After drugs


So to wrap it up, I don't wish to have started using drugs later life, as they made me have so many different experiences in the last couple of years and even tho it might sound cheap, before I started using drugs my brother and I almost hated eachother, while now, we are as close as we could be. I just acknowledge the fact that drugs may have sped up everything that was going on in me a little bit.

____


Hello, I abused MDMA and amphetamines in the past and most likely damaged my brain, especially the serotonergic system, though I didn't experience any comedown ever and I didn't experience depression afterwards, I just got some short term memory and concentration issues that I think are getting better and better over time. 

I decided to do a long break of at least 9 months after my last unsuccessful MDMA use with the purpose of  retrieving the magic / the full effects. My last attempt was on December 21 2019 ( I had come up but couldn't access a plateau and roll, it happened every last times that I tried until the last one, despite having tried pauses from weeks to months between attempts ), so I didn't consume MDMA since and today it's been 7 months that i'm clean from any amphetamine-type / or whatever neurotoxic substance. I'm also on a N-Acetyl-Cysteine cure ( NAC ).

In the past 7 months there has been some disturbing and very tough things going on in my life, I had some disturbed sleep at some moments, but after a time my sleep would always turn back to a decent state. 

Recently nothing particularly harsh happened to me, except a very tough bad trip after testing a combination of lsd high dose ( 800ug ) with Piracetam that was litterally unbearable for the mind, after that I got nightmares and early awakenings during a week or two, but once again it eventually calmed down and I could get decent nights.

More recently after seeing an acupuncturist ( that I still see because I want to finish the therapy to see if that can help ) for insomnia purposes, to ""consolidate"" my sleep, I started to get early awakenings quite every nights, whereafter I couln't get back to sleep after only 4-5 hours of sleep. 

At the beginning of the therapy he warned me that positive effects wouldn't occur instantly and that the beginning of treatment could cause an excess of nervous fatigue for a time, and if it's the case then I should be experiencing it fully by now, up to yesterday night I woke up after only 3h30 of sleep while being able to go back to sleep. Up to know I saw him 7 times in almost a month ( he also warned my that most cases would see a positive result after 10 to 20 seances ) and he told me that my early awakening could be related to this side effect. 

My sleep deprivation is too important as its going on since more than a month now, as i'm getting an early awakening every single night. There are some nights where I can go back to sleep, in a random way, but even those nights the amount of sleep i'm getting is way too low. Now I had to quit my job because of it, cause I can't bear the fatigue anymore and I don't know for how much time this will last.

I'm looking for a cause for those insomnias and I would like to explore every hypotheses, these insomnias are very problematic since they remove all the energy from me, I can't go on in my life and pursue my path correctly as long as they're here. So there is the hypothesis of energetic imbalance because of the beginning of the acupuncture treatment, and if it's that then it should get better soon, but there is also the hypothesis of a chemical reason that just prevents me to sleep, that could be due to some brain architecture / ressources in my brain following a replenish / regrowth processus preventing me from being able to sleep normally. That should also certainly get better with time but in the case of someone reads this and can help I'll take it.

I don't deny the hypothesis of potential psychological underlying reasons that could cause this but I hardly see how those insomnias could be mainly caused by psychological stuff as i'm feeling pretty okay nowadays, I'm not experiencing something particulary harsh going on right now, it's all been over for months now, even though these sleep problems are a source of anxiety and stress, I really don't think that could explain this level of severeness for my insomnias.

He asked my girl for a lighter so I wanted to know what he was smoking. He pulls out a pipe in his car and it looked like a weird meth/crack pipe. I said “oh I’m straight bro I don’t smoke dope” because he was clearly tweaking.

He said “nah it’s a dab pipe”. So I hit a huge dab (I never smoke dabs) and as I’m holding it in my mom pulled up to bring me something. I ran and tried to jump over my fence and busted my ass right in front of my mom and her bf lol.

Anyways, went back over there (free dab hits and all) and he asked if I wanted a bar (HELL YEA I DO). Gave me two. 

This is were it gets good/weird.

He asked if I wanted some shrooms and I said yes. He wanted me and my girl to come ride with him while we took them (I wanted to just trip her and I at home) so I said if you can bring them over that would be cooler.

I thought he wasn’t coming back, but low and behold he came back and gave us a legit, fat shroom chocolate.

I said I need atleast 1 1/2 of these probably 2. He claimed that they were incredibly strong (heard it a million times, but it was free). 

I gave my girl a 1/4 of it and took the 3/4. He leaves and my girl comes to show me this “Molly he gave her”. It was white and after I hit it clearly meth. I was pissed he slipped that sketch capsule to my girl.

Anyways. We had a good time. I feel less depressed today. That’s the goal I was going for. 

The thing that sucks is I told my girl to SAVE her Xanax for after the trip. She took it before and the guy assured me I would trip balls even with the Xanax. 

It killed the majority of the visuals and headspace, but hey it was free.

Government response worldwide seems to be to use police brutality. Beatings. Murders. Sieges. In response, people fight back. Bricks are thrown. In hong king there was a particularly unfortunate incident when people were set on fire. People are having their eyes shot out with rubber bullets. And what is worse is that instead of pacifying the protests, the brutality just enrages the protesters and creates solidarity. And then they show up with molotov cocktails. And then things get out of hand.

The government steps in with troops. Democracy is overturned, and totalitarian dictatorship is implemented. People are imprisoned for decades. People are murdered by the dozens in a brutal fashion. People are arrested by masked federal agents, taken to cia black sites, accused of terrorism, and then mercilessly tortured using methods that are not legal or constitutional to use under US law, but are used anyway because the black sites are off us soil, and the us citizen has been labelled ""a terrorist"".

Empathogenic drugs include MDMA, but MDMA is neither legal nor safe. After doing some basic reading, the drug that most closely matches the profile I am looking for is MDAI, however there are some concerns about its safety.

Funnily enough, I’ve also been experimenting with psychedelics more (lots of mushrooms and some acid). It was a few friends birthdays this weekend gone so, to celebrate, we took acid and the next day some shrooms.

So last night (Monday night) I fell asleep in my one bed flat, 4 hours drive away from my family home. Next thing, I find myself stirring to the sound of my fathers voice shouting down the stairs to me to wake up, which I’m slowly doing on the couch downstairs. I switch on the tv (can’t remember the program) and can hear my mother cooking in the background. 

I recognise in my dream that this isn’t right and I shouldn’t be there (therefore recognising I’m dreaming) but because I’m (from what I gather about) lucid dreaming; I don’t wake up. 

I then decide I need to pee, and get up off the couch and head to the toilet. Oddly the route to the toilet in my flat is similar to that as the family home, and as I’m walking this I’m getting flash frames in my vision of both routes/toilets, kind of like a flashback scene in a film going to and from the past/present.

Throughout the whole experience, I’m totally aware i’m dreaming, because theres no way I could be there, but when I try to wake myself up I’d close and open my eyes, slap myself, the lot  and still be there. This happened over and over until I was convinced I must be there, and only once I’d completely accepted that I must have travelled to my parents’ place, I closed my eyes to nap and woke up back in my flat. 

To note: I’m regarding this as a positive experience because I love lucid dreaming and am fascinated by the idea of them. I wasn’t scared or concerned at any point, just completely dumbfounded by what was going on.

I lemon tekked 3.5g of shrooms. My first trip was 2g and I had a bad trip where I was stuck in time and had a bad body load. This trip I flowed very well with time and didn’t feel nauseous. 

I felt very child like, a little dissociated, and very just connected with everything. Something I noticed is my breathing was a lot more primal and I was yawning a lot which made me feel like an animal for some reason. Also, I was ugly as fuck, I tried not to worry about it though but I’m so ugly when I’m tripping.

As far as visuals It was pretty intense. Whole room looked smooth, and everything in my room looked like it was rotating. Each carpet strain was wiggling back and forth. I spent a lot of time looking at the carpet and door.

Now for when I hit the nitrous.

First time I did it, I got visuals similar to acid, where trails/lines ran through different shit in my room and pulsated, making it look alive and with energy. I think you get what I mean. It was intense. 

2nd time I did it everything looked FUCKED. As if my whole POV was just cartoony puzzle pieces put together and it was all 2d. Very hard to explain. 

3rd time I watched my door expand infinitely, and was so out of it I think my ego had died. Wasn’t terrifying because I was literally brain dead but I was incapable of thinking while I watched my door expand infinitely.

I did dream when I would use marijuana but I felt my dreams were less crazy and I would remember only one if that. Now I have very random vivid dreams. I remember not only one but a few. This sounds odd but when I was smoking my dreams felt less real or I was not fully enveloped in it.

Also sorry this is kinda weird but now my dreams have became alot more sexual as well. I do not have wet dreams. I’ve only had one in my life and that was in my adolescence. Maybe this is all due to me being able to remember my dreams more and able to recognize the absurdity when I wake up.

3 years ago I experimented with MDMA for the first time. The first time I tried it, it was heavenly. I took 120mg once that evening. The euphoria was outta this world. 2 months later I gave it another try. Same dose, same results, incredible experience.

2 months later I decided to dose again, but this time I got reckless. I ended up dosing 2 nights in a row, going against my own rule I set for myself after all the research I had done. I knew it was a bad idea, but for some reason I didn’t give a fuck. 

The first night I ended up doing 200mg after a redose in the same night. That night was amazing, probably the best so far. The next night I dosed another 200mg total, but this time there was no euphoria. I had completely depleted the chemicals in my brain the night before and I knew I fucked up.

I tried to lay down and just wait for the stim effects to wear off, but something wasn’t right. My head started to feel... weird. It’s hard to explain exactly. Eventually, I felt a snap or tear. It happened in my head. It was like several rubber bands being torn apart at once, but in my head. It hurt a little. I was terrified of what I might have done to myself.

The next day I felt like most do after a night of MDMA; depressed and tired. Only these feelings have never gone away. 

I haven’t touched the substance since. It’s been 3 years since that night and I feel exactly the same. I don’t feel happiness anymore. I have no motivation. I’m just depressed, always.

I have always suspected I fucked up the serotonin receptors in my head, or something like that. I always thought that eventually it would get better, but it hasn’t. 

I decided to take MDMA again a few nights ago, just to see what would happen. I got the normal stim effects, sweating, and dilated pupils, but no euphoria, zero. I felt nothing. I probably shouldn’t have done this, but I just had to know if what I thought was correct, and unfortunately for me, it was. I really fucked myself up.

Will my brain ever heal itself? I don’t know how much longer I can go without experiencing happiness again, even if it’s just for a few moments. 

I’m sorry for the length of this, but I do appreciate you for reading till the end. 

Take care of your head, people.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for sharing your experiences and advice. I’m going to try a few supplements recommended in this thread. I’ve also decided I’m going to see a doctor, finally. It’s something I should have done a long time ago, but I’m just a stubborn idiot sometimes. I guess I just needed a little push, and I got it here.

We boilied down 24 inches of the stuff into about 600ML of product. Just finished my cups not too long ago. Tasted like ASS

I'm quite interested to see how this trip is going to go, I'll make sure to edit the post with an update.

Update: hey I’m laying down now and shit what a decent time! To clarify I did to a slight amount of research but it was my intention to try and experience this no expectations unlike I do with every drug I like to try. Overall though I’d say the experience was a really uplifting one and more of a body high. Real forgiving and straight forward!

The first few hours I had some pretty bad nausea I won’t lie. I puked and felt like heaven instantly. Went back inside and instantly started cracking jokes with my buddy. Had some real good conversation and a quality time.

Maybe someone can tell me but from what I ingested I’d call the effects rather light. I definitely felt ‘high’ but it was really sedating but at the same time uplifting euphoria. A different headspace then I have experienced with any other pysch.

Feel free to ask for my reasoning for any listing, and also to share your own ranking of the hallucinogens you've tried.

This ranking is of the three main classes of hallucinogens: psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants. Personally I'm also choosing to include entactogens (MDMA, MDA, ect.). I do consider cannabis to have mild hallucinogenic properties, but I will not be including it in this ranking.

Notes: Surprisingly, I have not found a hallucinogen that I actively hated. Even diphenhydramine, which to me was a very neutral (but interesting) experience even if I didn't ""enjoy"" it so to speak. That said, I probably wouldn't choose to do the last 5-7 items on this list. Items 1-10 are all my top tier hallucinogens.

So I've suffered from an anxiety disorder, OCD, for as long as I can remember and only when I was 13 did I start going on medication for it. I did different sorts of therapy, and while it did help, both my psychiatrist and I felt like it wasn't enough. I was prescribed Sertraline (SSRI) and started at about 25mg, slowly increasing the dose to 100mg where it felt comfortable and unneeded to increase it.

For the next 3 years I have been on this dosage and it has repaired huge parts of my life. But it has come to the time where my psychiatrist and I discussed slowly going down on my dose, so that I would be able to reach a goal of being drug free before I turn 18 and don't have to get medication from the hospital instead.

I decided that I wanted to try it even though I was given the option to continue. Its now been a few days since I started my 75mg dose and I have started to feel a bit off. I am not sure if it's the timing or just the state of my mind right now, but I definitely feel different, might I say in a negative way even.

This is where I want to ask my question: if there are any people experienced with going on SSRI for long and then getting off, do you mind giving me some advice? I would like to know what to expect and what will change. This whole process scares me more than I feel comfortable admitting to. I am only 16 and while I do lots of research, I feel much more reassured by personal experiences from older people who know their shit when it comes to getting off medication.

It's terrifying at times thinking back at how I used to be before I got help and how there might be a possibility for that version of me to come back to life.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,695577,public,confidence,self,Question regarding personal experiences,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/huz2u3/question_regarding_personal_experiences/,no_ads,0.0,1595326988.0,61289b14-9d47-11e5-99c5-0ef44579b8c1,Antidepressants,,Antidepressants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1595300191.0,

There’s something different about dawn from sun rise to like 11:30am after that everything starts making a little more sense again. Idk if it’s because that’s when I’m supposed to be waking up?....that shouldn’t make me feel guilt or shame...should it? All I did was not sleep. Maybe it’s not right because I’m stretching where my brain is metaphysically and where it’s supposed to be in time...like maybe sleep is like a way to unhook your brain from reality so when you wake up you hook yourself in place so the experiencing of thought and emotion is relatable to the source of awareness. So by not sleeping you are almost like the inverse of a ghost bc you are physically there but everything inside is old data your lagging behind trying to live without receiving what’s essentially an updated patch file for everyone which leads us forward toward fresh instances of the present. If you didn’t sleep your at a metaphysical dead end inside. So you frantically start looking for a what you can only get from sleep.

So at dawn the sun comes up birds chirping dew on the ground with fresh air but it’s not going to register to you as fresh unless your running on the patch that coincides with the day. You start to feel less alone as the day progresses because now the other humans start becoming more relatable as they approach the dead end of the patch where they require another update. So now you don’t feel as alienated and left behind. I feel like the longer you stay out of the present the more it will become unfamiliar and not relatable so you reject it...just like a sensory deprivation tank your brain will fill in spot that’s lack data...it come through as voices and events that don’t exist anywhere except your personal imagination. Instead of receiving data from source you hallucinate data instead so now the world calls you a schizophrenic or whatever term from the DSM they think fits.

So two weeks ago, my roomate (which is also my best friend) and I decided to try DXM for the first time. I'm not a very experimented drug user, but I do a lot of reasearch about drugs, so I had a good idea what we were going into. So, for this first experience, we decided to take 300mg of DXM HBr each (syrup with DXM only) along with a glass of pink grapefruit juice. About 1h into the trip, we also smoked some weed, and the overall experience was great! Of course, music was awesome, we robo-walked, robo-shited and the DXM was kind of euphoric. We didn't experience any dissociation though since we didn't take that much. It felt like a mid 2nd plateau experience.

Two weeks after this (which is just a few days ago), we decided to step up our dose a bit, this time with 450 mg in robitussin gel caps. Along with this, since I red a lot about potentiation, we each added:

\- 1 benadryl pill (25 mg) for the robo-itch and the nausea

\- 2 tums to avoid the nausea

\- A glass of pink grapefruit juice for potentiation (I can't find white grapefruit juice)

\- 3 caps of tumeric for potentiation (I don't think it does a lot)

\- A dozen black pepper corn for piperine potentiation

There were quite a lot of potentiation compounds, but since the first experience was chill, I figured this would do the trick.

So anyway, 30 minutes after taking the DXM, we were already feeling the effects. They were hitting harder and faster than the first time (obviously). 1 hour in, we decided to go smoke some weed, since its synergy with dxm is awesome and that the trip felt a bit gross compared to the first time (maybe because of the benadryl, I don't know). Smoking the weed quickly put us in this kinda euphoric state again. I think I hit the 3rd plateau that night; music was surreal, I felt like melting into the couch and CEVs were strarting to get interesting. I felt like I was thinking outside of my body and my vision was pretty distorded. I was in for a good trip.

Howerver, things started to go south pretty quickly for my roomate. I feel like he went from the 2nd plat to the 3rd plat to the 4th in a matter of time. In fact, about only 10 minutes after smoking the weed, I realised that my roomate wasn't with me listening to music anymore. I walked to his room and found him laying on his bed with his eyes opened. At first, I though he was just there thinking, so I shook him up and decided to bring the music speaker to his room. What I didn't realise is that while laying on his bed, he experienced a ""kind"" of ego death.

(As he told me after the trip, he was experiencing the same scene over and over again where he gets up, walks to the door only to find out that the door is locked. At this moment, for him, this repeated scene was all what life is, for eternity, thinking he was dead, with a ""game over"" feeling filling up his mind. He said he thought he would stay a vegetable forever and was stuck in this scene for eternity.)

So when I return to his room with the speaker, he was obviously freaked out, since he though that he would never return to normal life. Waking up from this totally strange state felt like a rebirth for him. It didn't take me long understand what just happened. As I said, I read a lot about drugs, and hopefully, I've already heard this kind of stories whith eternal loops so I was able to stay calm and deal with him. It took him around 1 hour to return to a 2nd plat state, but was still in shock of what just happened. We were still pretty fucked up though, and I didn't eant to totally waste the trip, so for the rest of the night, we talked about this surreal exprerience of his and listened to music with eyes closed (the CEVs were still pretty awesome on my side).

After this 2nd trip, I really don't know what to think. 450 mg didn't seem like a heavy dose and I didn't expect anything like this to happen. The were a lot of potentiation compounds, which may have strenghted the DXM a lot. However, we both have the same weight and we felt the 300mg of the first trip the same way, so he doesn't have enzyme deficiency. The only difference that I can think of is that my roomate had a totally empty stomach while mine was \~5 hours empty.

In summary, I want to know what you guys think of that. What did I do wrong? One really needs to be careful with potentiation. I'm scared I kinda ruined drugs for him, or at least this drug, since he is still in shock about all of this. Also, I didn't know that dxm+weed could lead to infinite loops (I thought it would happen mostly on psychedelics). Does any of you or friend of you have lived a similar experience?

I have a history of alcohol addiction, but no other drugs.. but I also have an impulsive control disorder, where I just do things without thinking..

At first I thought this medication was amazing, it got rid of my anxiety and depression and binges, I feel way more normal through the day, I’m not nearly as impulsive , but now all it does to me is makes me feel like I’m literally on speed, can only focus on one thing and get sucked into it, picking at my skin, scratching my head til it bleeds, OCD behaviour .. mentally it still makes me feel good, no binge urges, no anxiety or depression... but I’m scared that I like it too much already.. I’m also scared to get off it because it’s the only thing that has resolved my binge eating, and generally has taken away all my anxiety and depression, so I don’t want to be put off of it.. do you think this is just side effects and they will calm down? Or should I talk to my psychiatrist.. I just don’t know what to do

So, you are thinking about taking LSD. LSD experiences are complex and long-lasting. For many people, some trips will involve emotional swings. LSD also has a pronounced ""expectancy effect""; the experience one expects to have can significantly color the acid experience. As a result it is important to have a general understanding of what your LSD experience will be like, to be emotionally prepared for it and to create the atmosphere appropriate for the experience you are seeking. 

You may want start by reading about the different phases of an LSD trip that are commonly encountered.  Personal experiences vary, but this overview is an excellent starting point.  Much of this article focuses on being prepared for tricky stuff.  Please understand that people who are well-prepared for their acid trip almost always want to take LSD again.  They seldom have unpleasant experiences and in the case that challenging emotions arise, this phase of the trip will almost always be a small part of a longer, joyous journey. 

When you hear people who have had negative experiences ask yourself the following questions:  Did they take a recreational dose (&lt;150ug)?  Did they apply the well-known techniques outlined below to guide theoir trip?  Did they understand how to us Xanax (benzos) to impact their trip?  Did they trip in a safe environment with good friends?   We haven't encountered anyone who had a negative (won't repeat) experience who didn't fall short on one of these counts. So there is good reason to have confidence that your first experience with be a positive one. 


II.  Warnings

Do not take LSD if:
* you have a personal or family history of psychotic disorders or other severe psychiatric disorder
* you are taking Lithium, Tricyclics, Ritonavir or Indinavir, as there may be dangerous interactions.

Be aware:  SSRIs (like Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Desyrel) or MAOIs (like Nardil, Parnate, Marplan, Eldepryl, Aurorix, Manerix) are consistently reported to noticeably reduce the effects of LSD. MAOIs seem to cause a greater reduction in the effects of LSD than SSRIs.  Larger doses may counteract the effects of SSRIs and MAOIs, but reduces the predictability of the experience.


III.  Preparing

Reading a few trip reports may help set general expectations for what to expect.  Reading about the phases of an LSD trip is also valuable.  

Dose
A threshold consideration is what type of experience are you seeking. At low doses one will likely feel very much in mental control, while still enjoying visual effects such as beautiful colors and patterns, enhanced sense of taste and enjoyment of music. At a larger dose visual effects become more intense, including powerful hallucinations and significantly reduced ability to make sound decisions. Moving beyond this we leave the realm of recreational doses. Visuals and auditory hallucinations will be intense, but importantly one may lose almost all rational thought and enter a world of temporary psychosis, with the sense of self disappearing and magical thinking taking over the mind. This may be very enjoyable, interesting and/or disturbing and frightening.

For a first experience, a recreational dose is a great place to start. Some may want to start with a high dose, and go for a ""spiritual dose"" or a ""heroic dose"", but this guide is geared toward a recreational experience. Our only advice is to understand that there is a fun/recreational experience on one side of the LSD line, and a very different type of experience on the other side of the LSD line, and it's important to know which side of that line you want to be on.

A good recreational dose is 75ug to 125ug. For those with anxiety about LSD, one might aim for 75ug to 125ug. With those with no anxiety, a positive mental place and desiring a more intense experience, 125ug to 150ug may be better.

Note: Weight appears to play less of a role in dosing than is true with many other drugs. The doses above are based on a 150 lb person. From personal observations, a 50 lb increase or decrease in weight equates to no more than a 10% change in dose.

Getting Things Ready

You will want clean, uncluttered spaces for your trip, so tidy the rooms you plan to spend time in before the trip. Have a source of music ready for each room, or a portable speaker to bring with you.  If you aren't tripping at home, clean up your bedroom so when you return home you have a pleasant environment to sleep/decompress in. Even if you aren't normally a clean freak, on LSD cleanliness/order almost always matters.

It's likely you want to spend much of your time outside, so consider whether there are safe places in your yard or a local park to enjoy nature.  Have a picnic blanket ready and things you can use as pillows outside (rolled up beach towels work well).

Unlike most drugs, LSD is a great time to enjoy food (usually in the second half of the trip). Get everything ready in advance and then bring out small bites when you start to feel like eating.  We usually start with sweet foods and then go savory.  Quantity of food is generally very small early on.... one nut can go a long way.

Group Dynamics

When tripping with other people, it's valuable to have a discussion about preferred group dynamics.  Do you intend to all stay together?  Are there safe places for people to go to have personal time?

If there may be a sexual component to the experience, discussing boundaries before the trip, as it may be impossible to give meaningful consent or to establish healthy boundaries once the trip has started.  Discussion may include comfort level around nudity, public displays of sexuality, physical touching of each other, etc. 

Unlike MDMA, which tends to have a more consistent sexual component, LSD has a very mixed impact on sexuality.  Some people may become more highly sexualized while for others it may decrease sexuality.  Even once consent and boundaries are established before the trip, it's critical to continue to check in during the trip.  Never expand a boundary beyond where it was during sobriety, but continue to check that what worked during sobriety still works throughout the trip


IV. Guiding Your Trip

Mental State
Be aware of your mental state before the trip, both your mood the day of the trip and your overall mental state in your life.  At recreational doses, most people find it fairly easy to control their mental state during a trip.  If you have sadness or conflict in your life, these feelings may arise during the trip, but typically in a very manageable or even cathartic manner.  

There need never be “bad trips”.   Trips may feel lighthearted, they may feel heavy, they may feel easy, or they may feel complicated.  Always approach a psychedelic experience with the assumption that the experience will be a positive one for you.  Spend some time visualizing the general type of experience you want to have - it will likely become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  If you want to have a fun, recreational experience, just focus on having that type of experience, and set the stage accordingly with a nice sunny day, upbeat music and lively friends. But also be prepared to embrace a more complicated experience, without viewing it as bad. Learn from every experience and use it for personal growth and mental cleansing.  

Note:  in our experience, even if you are not in a happy place in your life, LSD can be a rewarding experience.  Dealing with powerful loss, such as the death of a loved one or the end of a significant relationship need not, by itself, preclude an amazing experience.  Psychedelics have been clinically shown to be effective at helping people cope with their own terminal illness.  However, there is a significant chance that these experiences will impact your LSD trip, and you may feel deep sorrow, a profound sense of poignancy, or other powerful emotions.  Therefore, you should be in a mindset to allow those emotions to arise, live with them for as long as feels healthy and cathartic, and then actively cause them to move on as described below.  You should be mentally prepared to accept these emotions without strong fear or anxiety, and simply accept these as being a natural part of any LSD experience, and a natural part of life itself.

Challenging Trips
For well-prepared people, who take an appropriate dose, in a carefully curated setting, challenging trips are very rare.  Despite the best preparation, some trips may be more challenging than others. The best way to avoid a challenging experience is to understand:  1) there is an extremely low risk of long-term negative physical or psychological problems associated with LSD (zero reported in thousands of clinical studies); and 2) most people find that they are able to guide their experience to where they want it if they have the right tools.  

Unlike many drugs, on LSD most people can choose to change their mental state if they find themselves to be in a challenging emotional place.  The first thing to do if you experience something emotionally challenging that you want to stop is to change things up:  go someplace with a lot of light (preferably sunlight), put on new music, talk with a new person about a new topic of conversation, etc.  
It's important to note that emotional swings are inherent in LSD experiences.  Crying is absolutely normal, as is laughter... often within minutes of each other.  Many people find LSD to be an effective time to process emotional pain, and do self-work.  And most people find that even if they start down the path of looking deeply into painful areas of their life, they can quickly stop that process by deciding they have had enough and changing things up... more light, different music, etc.  Attention spans are short on LSD - use this to your advantage.

If you are struggling, do not be embarrassed to ask for help.  If someone else appears to be struggling, ask in a neutral way if they need anything.  Someone sobbing during an LSD experience may be an indication of something not going right... or it may be a moment of grand self-awareness, which they will treasure forever.  Never make an assumption about others' states of mind.

You may also want to have Xanax or a similar benzo class drug on hand.  Taking one will greatly reduce the psychedelic effect of LSD, as well as general anxiety.  It is likely you can take one and take a nap to end your LSD experience.  While it's worth having Xanax at hand, we have never been with anyone who has decided to use it.  Changing music, conversation and/or location has always been entirely effective in helping people have the acid experience they desired.  However, those who are anxiety prone may feel less anxiety simply knowing that the option to end the trip is available, eliminating the need to ever take the Xanax.

Interacting with others
Never assume you know what another person is experiencing on LSD.  It is common for LSD to cause people to believe to have deep insights into another person's mind state, and these insights can be extremely inaccurate.  Therefore, always ask direct questions before making assumptions about what any other person wants or desires on LSD  
Consent.  Sexual consent on LSD is tricky at best.  At higher doses, even understanding the concept a sexual experience may be impossible (during ego dissolution, sex may be conceptualized in bizarre ways, for example).  Therefore, if sex may be on the table, expressly discuss sexuality prior to ingesting LSD and establish boundaries prior to a trip.  

LSD is a poor time to start a sexual relationship or extend boundaries with a new partner.  We believe most people are not in a position to give meaningful consent during an LSD experience and the risk of causing or experiencing substantial harm as the result of an unwanted sexual encounter is significant.

Partnership dynamics

One of the most common areas of conflict during a trip are romantic partners wanting different lengths or intensity of experiences.  It's very important to either get on the same page by going with the more conservative experience (e.g., lower dose, not re-dosing), or to get on the same page by agreeing to have different experiences.  Avoid getting on the same page by pushing anyone out of their comfort zone.  Remember, this is only your first experience and it is more important to have a positive connecting experience your first time out than to have an intense and entirely fulfilling experience.  

It is very common for people to have complex emotions around their interpersonal relationships during an LSD experience.  While LSD may lead to significant insights, it usually takes many days after a trip to process the experience.  

An acid is not a great time to have a challenging conversation.  It's also not a great time to make an unexpected marriage proposal.  Focus on what connects you to your partner.  If you start your trip believing it will be a connecting experience, and throughout the trip look for connecting moments, you will likely walk out of the experience more in love than ever.  

Remember to give your partner space if they request it (physical or emotional) or support if requested.  LSD experiences can vary radically between people.  Avoid the temptation to try to change your partner's emotional state unless they request the change (or respond affirmatively if you ask them if they would like help to change their head space). 


V.  After Care

Most people can go to work the next day without issue, and do all the day-to-day things they normally do.  Some people report feeling mental fatigue, but otherwise there is very little or no hangover the following day, assuming you get a good night's rest.  You may be very hungry if you haven't had a good meal after the trip, so plan accordingly.  Not only do we find little or no hangover the next day, LSD is a wonderful hangover cure for MDMA - taking MDMA on a Friday or Saturday night and LSD the next day all but eliminates the MDMA hangover for us, so much so that we seldom do MDMA without following up with LSD the next day.

But be gentle with yourself and other trippers in the days after an LSD experience.  
Take the time to reflect on your experience, including any personal insights you may have discovered.  The role of your ego may feel significantly diminished in the days following a trip.  You may have a feeling of acceptance of yourself and others.  And you may have deep insights.

You may also have false insights, misinterpretation of your experience, and confusion.  It is critical:  Do not make big life decisions in the days following a trip. People often chuckle when they hear this advice the first time (and it's very common advice).

Guess what?  People quit jobs after an LSD experience.  They break off long term relationships.  They delete Facebook accounts.  They do all sorts of drastic things.  And then they may feel deep regret over the hasty decision.  Take the time to process your experience.  You may decide to make a life change... but give it a week.  If it's critical to do, it will still feel just as critical a week later.

If anyone has any other questions regarding  
psychedelics, or any other drug classes don’t hesitate to ask!

Neophyte hallucinogen user here, trying to explore it a little more and broaden my horizons safely. Been wondering about this for a long time ever since a friend of mine talked to me about the dangerous side effects of DMT and its supposed more destructive nature as compared to other hallucinogens like shrooms and LSD, both of which I've used before but still refuse DMT when offered. I think that same friend also explained it to me as an easier to make LSD equivalent, which is both more difficult and more risky legally speaking to make.

So far I’m tolerating it better than I thought I would and I can see a positive change in my appearance. So it’s working without starving myself or depriving myself of sleep for too long. I lost 20LB(prob gottA subtract water weight idk) and I’m happy about that.

Because of my big IV opioid addiction years ago I did a number on my shit machine. At one point I would only shit once every two weeks. It would be a huge hard, dry, mucus infused mega turd that was too big to pass my sphinct’. The worst belly pain in the world for 2 hours while on the toilet sweating and salivating a huge puddle on the floor in front of me. My heart would race and palpitate making me think I would die taking a shit like Elvis. I’d always prevail but not without blood shed.

I think that stretched my large intestine so now I’m able store abnormal amounts of shit in there. Idk but my stomach had been looking distended for the past few years....especially on the lower left side. Having a bowl movement has been painful as fuck ever since I started opioids and even though I stopped heroin and got to a really low dose of buprenorphine it still fucking hurts. 

Amphetamine salts/meth allows me to shit with like 95% less pain and because of that I took advantage and decided to try to totally evacuate my bowels to finally pass the theoretical impaction that has been chilling in there for years. I drank ALOT of water with miralax mixed into it. Than did a line of crystal. I took a huge shit. Than I shit again an hour later which was atleast a foot long. I thought that was it but I kept feeling this tightness around where my belly distended out the most. I had to get in the perfect position to feel gas pass by that area. After a few more hours I started feeling a sensation similar how it feels when water unclogs from the ear canal but it wasn’t that it was inside of my ass. It was the impaction I knew was in there finally starting to move in the right direction. It was like a plug made of shit beginning to slide which was creating a suction internally. I didn’t realize a lot of my discomfort was because of that being inside my body but became the norm effectively becoming blind to it. So anyway I shit three more times and knew I was done when the shit finally changed consistency from hard and dry to soft and moist packed with undigested corn kernels from last nights dinner. I wouldn’t have been able to handle that without the amphetamines.

And now to what the post is for.....so meth helped me shed not only the extra weight but extra shit also. My only problem is that the meth seems to trigger spasms underneath the area that was visibly distended. So I’m starting to feel like that “impaction” was actually just my intestine having a spasm that constricts it to the point of blocking gas and shit... I don’t know but can someone tell me why meth fucks around with my IBS making me bloat and feel a lot of pressure? Benzos and gabapentin make it stop and I’m positive that benzos caused it. Some people call it benzo belly...making it feel as though nothing is moving inside of your body as if you can’t digest any food. The meth also made my esophageal disfunction/pain that make food and drink get stuck unable to get down into the stomach which hurts like a morherfucker. It’s probably a hiatal hernia. I also haven’t been getting any acid reflux whatsoever. I usually have to either take omeprazole everyday or take Pepcid when ever the acid flares up which was a daily occurrence. 

I feel like amphetamines help me not only my ADHD but all of my digestive system malfunctions caused from a lot of different things but mostly stress and nervous system depressants and withdrawal. 

Oh let me also add this. Opioids made me suppress all need for sex. I couldn’t cum while on heroin or even a normal dose of subutex. After awhile I just gave up on relationships and sex. I was like a eunuch and just wanted to drug myself unconscious. I subconsciously wanted to be dead. This meth use over the past month has helped me remember and get my sex drive back. It’s been a long time but I fucking love how I can feel attraction towards the opposite sex instead of being completely numb to it.

That being needle exchanges.

I didn't know much about these services, as I personally don't use IV drugs, however my best friend, who I love and care about an incredible amount, was / is an IV user. She has been purchasing unpackaged needles from her drug dealer for $10 a piece, and I suggested to her that she try and locate a needle exchanges as they would from my understanding provide free totally safe needles.

Today she called me and asked if she should come over as she had gone by a needle exchange and was incredibly amazed by what they provided.

She was given 3 naloxone kits (each with 2 sets of naloxone in them), 50 needles of various gages, cookers (metal containers to cook whatever in), sterile water in nice little containers, cotton filters for drawing your substance, as well as ""sharp containers"" being a container to keep your needles in for exchange.

On top of this they also provided hygine items such as pads, fentanyl test strips, and they even had a food bank where people picking up items could get 8 pieces of food.

Their website also states that the provide safe snorting and smoking kits, tourniquets, first aid supplies, as well as hygine supplies, all of which are incredibly useful for drug users.

She was truly amazed, and while I knew this was a thing, I had no idea how many harm reduction and safe use supplies they offered.

The people at the facilities are also, at least from out experience, incredibly nice. They aren't judgemental, they aren't trying to get you to stop using or making you feel bad for what you are going through, they want to help keep you safe as best as possible.

I wanted to share this because she was truly so afraid to go, check it out, and get what would help her, she thought it would be scary and judgemental but instead they helped her, and made sure she never had to go through a dealer for harm reduction supplies again. The one she went to is also anonymous, you only had to provide the first letter of your first and last name I believe.

So if you are an IV user, or are around people who are IV users, please check out your local needle exchange. You should be able to find them by just googling needle exchanges, or there are locators on google that help you find them as well. These are truly amazing organizations, and I know our state is one of the more progressive states for drug use and harm reduction, but I hope most states do have something like this because to me it really is amazing and is a great step to helping the drug community.

Last night I attended the best home rave I've ever been to and I felt like testing my limits. It started during the day at around 3pm and lasted until 2am or so. 
So I was having a blast on X for the first few ours. I like to start slow and was only starting to roll hard about three hours in (I even popped half a 2cb pill ""yellow batman"" that was left from my last trip, but I did not really feel any effects) and I was totally in love with everyone there. There were 20 people at the party, including my best friends.
At some point in time, I think at around 11pm, I had about 1¾ pills of X ""blue punishers"" and was well past my ""in love"" phase and started to go into the on-edge phase, so I stopped taking more and danced untill I cooled down a bit. I brought some Ketamine because apparently it's super effective after taking X and I wanted to try it. I got over confident and snorted like 5 lines in about 40 minutes (I think, I had totally lost track of time at this point) and to top it all off I had another balloon of nitrous oxide.
This balloon completely LAUNCHED me into what I think was a K-hole, something I had never experienced before. I was just staring at the ceiling, completely oblivious as to what was going on. I totally forgot where I was, what I was looking at and that I had a body. Luckily I was in a comfortable place, resting against my friends, who later told me that I was spacing out for about fifteen minutes before I could communicate again. I heard one of my favorite songs and got up and stumbled to the dancefloor. It felt like I was dancing for about one or two hours, most of the time with my eyes closed and in a completely different universe. Wildest experience I've EVER had. To be honest I have no idea how I could even stand, let alone dance! All I could see were my very intense closed-eyes hallucinations and I could not feel my body move. It was like I had transcended my human form and I morphed into a being of only music and visuals. Ather about one or two hours I was pretty relieved when I got to my senses again and realised where I was and what I was doing.
I went back to the room where I had the balloon to sit down and ask what happened. Apparently I had only been dancing for about fifteen minutes haha, that really fucked with my head. After that I decided that I had fried my brain enough for the night and stopped taking more drugs. I danced untill I could not stand anymore and crashed at my friends place. Best. Rave. Ever.

Throughout this whole K-trip I was luckily never really frightened or panicked, just really fucking confused and out of this world. I did not intend to go this far but I was kinda glad I did (and not any further, thank God). I'm still wondering if it was a K-hole that I was in, curious as to what your experiences are. Not looking to try it again anytime soon though haha.

"" *There are basically two kinds of philosophy. One’s called prickles, the other’s called goo. And prickly people are precise, rigorous, logical. They like everything chopped up and clear. Goo people like it vague. For example, in physics, prickly people believe that the ultimate constituents of matter are particles. Goo people believe it’s waves. And in philosophy, prickly people are logical positivists, and goo people are idealists. And they’re always arguing with each other, but what they don’t realize is neither one can take his position without the other person. Because you wouldn’t know you advocated prickles unless there was someone advocating goo. You wouldn’t know what a prickle was unless you knew what a goo was. Because life isn’t either prickles or goo, it’s either gooey prickles or prickly goo.* ""

I’m very spiritual and I enjoy tripping as a means of expanding my consciousness and opening my mind’s eye. I decided to go to CVS and buy a 5oz bottle of Delsym (about 888 mg DXM) after doing plenty of research on the effects. I know its unrealistic to expect the same results as an acid trip from drug store cough syrup but I was willing to give it a shot. I drank the syrup slowly over a 10 minute period in hopes that it wouldn’t upset my stomach. After an hour and a half I started to receive a nice body high and I felt increasingly inebriated. The feeling wasn’t similar to acid at all but it wasn’t bad either. After 2.5-3 hours I started to feel very sick. I ended up gagging myself which led to me projectile vomiting. I threw up so forcefully that it actually hurt my throat and nose, but after that I felt a little bit better. I started to notice my motor skills were becoming increasingly inept so I laid in bed and watched youtube videos. I was watching Mitch Hedberg standup comedy and struggling to understand the jokes. I still felt very nauseous. It’s not unusual for me to not want to get out of bed while tripping but this was for a completely different reason. I did not feel good at all. I didn’t get any visuals out of the experience either which was dissappointing. My pupils were so dilated I was actually concerned that I had become cross-eyed. After laying in bed for about 6 hours I decided to try and sleep the rest of the high off because I was not enjoying it at all. The only good part about the trip was laying down with my eyes closed felt very peaceful and relaxing. I saw some pretty cool stuff with my eyes closed so I gotta say it was very nice to just lay there and let my imagination entertain me until I fell asleep. The next morning when I woke up, I was so high it was hard to walk. I had mild diarrhea as well. It was very hard to urinate for days after the effects had worn off and I was worried I might need to be hospitalized.
All in all, DXM is way more similar to being extremely drunk than actually tripping. If you like shrooms and acid like me and seek those types of trips I do not recommend DXM. If you just want to get fucked up I still wouldn’t try it.

The next moment, I'm worrying about something else.  **It's like trying to catch positive thoughts/emotions are like ice cubes: slippery, really hard to hold onto and melting rapidly.

I tried to quit them like 2 weeks ago because I was feeling good and wanted to try drug free methods live cbt, meditation etc. Everything was fine for 2-3 days, but then it got horrible. I wasn't sad - I was literally in mental pain as my default mood. Obviously I started to dose again after that and had to smoke myself to sleep for couple of days.

I just don't really know how to make this transition without suffering. My psychiatrist has a mentality of 
"" take these pills and gtfo"", and I can't afford a private one. 

I've been reading a lot about it, and most of the tips can be concluded to ""live your day like you are a healthy person - work, exercise, build relationships etc"". Cool story bro, I'm healthy already.

I have never had a bad trip but have seen two people have bad trips in my life but nothing compares to what I saw happen off of three and a half tabs of lsd. 

Around 3 hours in me and her roommate start to smoke some weed I am seeing crazy visuals and having a good time my girlfriend did not smoke but insisted we go outside. So I put the weed away and go outside where she’s sort of doing some weird thing but kind of to be expected off the dose I get her attention that she’s acting weird and she sits by me and begins to cry and say I don’t know what I’d do if you left me and it worried me so I said let’s go inside we go inside and are just chilling but she’s starting to put some bad thoughts in my head talking about my parents and I’m like not right now babe. 

Then shit starts to get wild because I hear a phone ringing and she’s calling her parents and I’m like don’t do that and all of a sudden her parents were like are you on drugs and I was freaking out like saying hang up and then she basically told them she’s on acid and they are pissed at us so I tell her parents sorry and I’m taking care of it. Then I bring her back to the bedroom and tell her to chill out and just relax and lay in bed with me for the remaining time and she’s like let’s go outside almost exactly like before and I’m like let’s just chill and then she starts saying she needs to get to her family and that’s when I was like somethings off with her. 

She gets up and runs towards the door and I tell her roommate somethings up don’t let her out just relax her and call our friends to help out and so she starts to say let me out and I told her I don’t feel good and want to stay inside but she keeps going through thought loops where she wants to go outside and I keep telling her my friends are coming and they want to see me and we can’t go outside or they won’t find us but she’s completely not herself at this point and no rational thoughts were being said by her and then I would have to carry her back from the door to the bedroom because she kept trying to break out and I would have to calm her down. After like 5 times of this I’m freaking out and telling my friends I need help now and then she hops up and says let me out and runs to the door but is stopped by her roommate so then she breaks away from her and I’m talking to my friend on the phone but she jumps up and is like I’m gonna break this window and starts punching it three times and it shatters she luckily didn’t get any cuts from the glass and it only broke part of it. I grab her off and am worried she’s gonna need to go to the hospital but couldn’t imagine freaking out in a hospital so I got my friends here and they basically took all the drugs out of the house in case cops were called or we needed to get an ambulance. She says she gonna puke after I carried her to the bedroom and then she gets to the bathroom and pukes all over several times and is rolling around and I get on top of her and just hold her and tell her I want to cuddle but at this point she’s not talking to me but also kind of talking to me so I try to guide her towards calming down but her mind is nowhere to be found she starts saying the alphabet and saying words of each letter she said talked about all her family members and would every once in a while say I want to die and what have you done to me. She would eventually get off track and just scream like hell enough for the whole neighborhood to assume an axe murderer is in the house. I would just hold her and say I’m here for you but then she would snap back for a bit and say let’s go outside and this time I just couldn’t let her go because I feared what she would do outside. 

Then I eventually had to restrain her and at that point she broke my glasses started ripping up my shirt and I got her to calm down but she would then just puke I was seriously concerned for her well-being but I knew it would only be worse in a hospital and she didn’t have any major injuries in fact I had probably sustained worse during the battle and she I knew I only had to get her through 3 hours until she would start coming down and it felt like eternity while I was tripping, towards like 5-6 hours in she started to snap out of it and would every once in a while say normal stuff that we were doing before she went into this state and that’s when I knew she would be okay so I just held her and brought her back to the bedroom where I helped her get clothes on since she ripped them off in the bathroom and it looked like a tornado had gone through there.

My main question for you guys is sublingual ketamine vs IV ketamine, I've read Hydroxynorketamine and norketamine levels are potentially the more therapeutic metabolites of the drug that produce relief and they seem to be higher with sublingual. Any input is greatly appreciated!

I've been researching ketamine greatly the last month and a half as I try to exit this prolonged depressive relapse caused by trying to get off my SSRI (Going on 5 years of zoloft, made my way down from 200mg 14 months ago to 25mg now).

IV treatment is the 'gold standard' but funds are limited at the moment and 'Mindbloom' is here in NYC offering oral and IM treatment. The regimen is waay less intense, IV is once every other day for 12 days and $3k later...only to most likely relapse in a month and get a booster. Mindbloom is one treatment a week with integration therapy included.

Started with the DXM and acid, once I felt the come up I took the 4-aco and continued to take bumps of the K throughout the entire experience. I had very profound body disassociation similar to a high dose of 3-Meo-pcp however my head was far more clear and I found it easy to form sentences and communicate. However the body dissociation became So intense that at times it was nearly impossible to move, however it was enjoyable and not concerning. At times it felt like my legs had rooted into the bed. The room looked very strange, the ceiling looked like it was draped like a tapestry. I had some CEVs but they were very different than typical psychedelic induced ones, they had more visual depth but less crisp lines and were generally more melty. I had a very strong sense of mental and physical euphoria. I was watching music videos on YouTube and I found I could get completely engrossed in any genre that I put on, everything from dubstep, rap, alternative, I even really enjoyed the footloose music video. When I finally got around to the nitrous I was deep into the experience. Typically I hit around 4 whips at a time and fish out, however I would blast off so hard from just one that I didn’t have the mental capacity to load any more. Each canister would blast me off into a deep visual experience. I believe I closed my eyes almost every time and it felt as though gravity would increase substantially as I drifted away into the visuals. When I finally got up I had some severe robo walk which I found amusing. Overall it was a really incredible experience. While I did get some sleep afterwards (thanks to hydroxyzine) I had very little energy the next day, however I had a nice afterglow.

Hi all,

I've some history of Xanax use. I used to recreationally use it here and there (1-3mg) and have a few beers, maybe once fortnight last year. Since recently, I've been dropping 2mg Alprozolam bars like crazy because of COVID-19 related stresses. The first couple I took a fortnight ago I was wavey as fuck and even blacked out for hours. I was doing all sorts of wack shit according to everyone. I've been taking around 1.5-3mg a day just to cope with overall pressure for the past fortnight. Today I've dropped a total of 10mg (5mg some hours ago in which I took a nap, 5mg in the last couple hours) and I'm not really feeling much at all. I'm still quite coherent.

I know I've built a tolerance. I'm just wondering if this tolerance will subside eventually or I'll never get that same feeling again from a single 2mg bar?

I acknowledge that I need to take a break for my own safety as I'm concerned about irreversible damage and the inability to feel the full effects of Xanax again.

Just to add - I've been severely stressed/depressed lately due to COVID-19 issues, so I'm not sure if that's affecting the performance of the pills.

**I'm asking that people please don't attack me for my abuse - I'm not using them to get high for entertainment or recreational purposes, I'm simply just struggling to cope during my crisis caused by COVID-19 and trying to find an outlet. My intentions for using Xanax is pure.**

It is summer break right now so I don't have any stress from school and I have a group of friends that I really trust and feel safe and comfortable with. 

But since last month I've been reacting badly to drugs I'm normally familiar with like molly and acid. I had a panic attack on molly and paranoia and anxiety on acid. I took a short break from psychs and did 2cb recently, thinking the bad trips were a one time thing.  It started off as a really fun and cool experience but I somehow got really paranoid and fell in to one of the worst thought loops of my life. My friends who were sober tried to calm me down but it didn't work.

A common theme among the bad trips is the thought that my friends are sabotaging me and laughing at me because of my bad trips, I got the delusion that I was on  something like the truman show when I was on acid and 2cb, thinking every passerby or stranger that I saw was an actor of some sort and the whole world was laughing at me and everything was calculated to expose me (I even found nature to be fake), I questioned my friendships and my reality (what if what I took wasn't really 2cb or acid but a vitamin pill or just a tab of paper and this is all just placebo and I am the biggest pussy of all time)

Does anyone know why I've recently been reacting this way? Like I said, I consider myself mentally and emotionally healthy with a great group of friends. I've taken acid, molly etc. before and have always reacted positively. The bad trips all started around a month ago.

I hope you can forgive it, I just had a lot to say. If you aren't up for the long read, I employ you to at least read the final 2 paragraphs because that's what's mainly important, but if that's also more than you'd like I've provided a bare bones TLDR at the bottom :)

I tried Adderall for the first time when I was a highschool freshman and totally loved it. I took it before my classes and remember putting so much care and thought into my work that day. Not only was I finally motivated to accomplish something, but I was also satisfied with the result. I did it a few times in that time period and then didn't touch it for a while.

Fast forward to junior year. At this point I had many drug expeirences under my belt. Namely just club drugs, different psychedelics, ketamine, but most notably, Molly. I tried Molly over the previous summer and couldn't get enough of it. My friends and I had all tried it together for the first time and had exclusively done it with each other after. Soon though, we realized how much we had been doing it and decided to hold off as to not spoil the beauty and sacredness we held for it.

At this point, I knew I was an upper guy. Sitting around and nodding off never seemed appealing to me. I preferred a high that let me have fun and participate in things. The school year started back up and that's where my old friend Adderall came in.

I do actually have pretty severe ADHD, but ironically enough I've never received medication for it, however my friend who doesn't have ADHD somehow managed to get medication. It was dextroamphetamine but for simplicity sake I'm just going to call it Adderall because it's similar enough and that's what everyone's most familiar with. He didn't take it very often so he would give them to me a lot.

I began really noticing how helpful Adderall was for me. Not just for productivity and motivation, but for every facet of my psyche. It gave my brain the space it needed to breath. I constantly have so many thoughts and I feel like they're all desperately fighting for the spotlight in my conciousness, but with Adderall I was able to let them go so easily and move on. Same thing emotionally, typically I would think about something slightly negative and proceed to tunnel down until it became extremely depressing, but with Adderall I was able to accept those thoughts the same as any other and simply viewed them as par for the course instead of feeling my usual hatred towards them.

Because of the mental serenity it granted, I began using it for the carefree lifestyle in addition to the much needed motivation/productivity. I was so depressed at the time and it truly liberated me, it gave me the reassurance that although my feelings weren't always ""normal"" they were my own nonetheless and they mattered just as much as anyone else's. I would usually get a few from my friend, take one or two per day, and just binge on it until I ran out. The lack of sleep did cause some occasional issues, and there was considerable weight loss, but the mental security made it all worth it. The ability to live without my brain torturing me was a massive relief.

Anyways, he no longer gets the prescription filled so I went without it for a long while until I found out where my mom keeps hers a couple days ago (she's who I got my ADHD from). In these past few days I've rediscovered how amazing this substance is. This is when I finally realized Adderall was MY drug. I love all stimulants but no other fits me so perfectly. Molly is amazing but it's more about having a singular great time opposed to overall life improvement. I actually had an expeirence with meth aswell but didn't enjoy the inconvenience of the insane duration, it was just so unmanageable. Adderall is right in the goldilocks zone.

In all honesty, it's comforting knowing there's a substance that so perfectly meets all my issues with solutions, but it's also sort of terrifying. No matter what I'm going through, I'll always have have this perpetual awareness that I could solve it with a pill. I fear that in the future that awareness will discourage me from practicing healthy coping methods because there's something that can do a much better job while taking much less effort. I don't really feel guilty about using it as a cruch because in a sense my brain actually has a metaphorical ""broken leg"". However, I'm worried that one day it may cease to be a support and instead become a hindrance. Continuing the ""cruch/broken leg"" analogy, it would be akin to using a wheelchair; certainly still helpful, but unnecessary to the point of becoming a burden. Fixing the solution but ultimately preventing me from reaching my full potential.

It feels great to have something that compliments me so well, but it's also indimidating knowing I might never be able to achieve that sensation on my own. I'd love to have more control over my thoughts, but the sad truth is that I simply don't. Adderall is a substance that empowers me with so much control but consequently emphasizes how little control I have without it. I can't think of anything more bittersweet.

TLDR; I have a long history with Adderall but just recently noticed the extent of my love for it. I adore the feeling it provides but am also deeply scared of that adoration.

Edit: Once again I'd like to apologize for the length. Ik a lot of the backstory might be unecessary but I felt like I should do my best to explain my full journey with the substance to portray how it progressively became my favorite.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,695472,public,confidence,self,Finding your drug of choice is simultaneously invigorating and terrifying,0,[],0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hunqdj/finding_your_drug_of_choice_is_simultaneously/,no_ads,0.0,1595289332.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1595260768.0,

I’ve seen reports of people snorting it to get high, but it seems most concentrated in the prison system.

Like many unconventional drugs however (like nutmeg, dxm, datura etc.) all I can find on the internet is „Don‘t do it,“ without any actual harm reduction or advice. 

So my question(s) are- 
Is it as simple as crushing up a few of my pills, (I have a script for it) and then snorting them? My pills aren’t very high dose compared to many who take wellbutrin; What’s the dosing I should be snorting?

I then weighed 1.2g of phenibut and 1g of taurine and placed the powders dry into a paper cup. I place both items well away from any place that people or animals could accidentally reach for safety.

I consume the Memantine solution first, noting it’s strange almost “alien” minty taste. The phenibut and taurine are dissolved in water and consumed together as a solution. The early hours of the morning proceed normally, with the chores being done before the onset. I decided to also go outside and take a gander at Venus and The Moon in the dawn sky.

My cat also comes by to pay a visit and antagonizes my ability to successfully raid as hard as the memantine wants to antagonize my NMDA receptors.\n\nT+ 1:00 It is now 7 in the morning and I am rapidly approaching the long plateau I will call home for the rest of the day. I sit on the kitchen floor and my body is feeling numb. My mood is simultaneously neutral and good, though there was no way the phenibut was playing a role as that takes at least 2 hours to kick in for me. My mom wakes up and puts on the Today Show and I am welcomed by the warm embrace of coronavirus news and “In these difficult times” commercials. My morning interactions are completely normal as I can handle the “wonkiness” of memantine really easily. Not wanting to get a headache, I make a small coffee to feed my physiological caffeine addiction I’m too lazy to try to fix.\n\nT+ 2:00 My mom goes to work and I have the place to myself, sort of as my brother sleeps very late into the day. I decide to go outside into the backyard to listen to music on my phone and enjoy the fresh air. Moving was not an issue and using the railings/walls and taking it slow was more than enough to keep steady. The act of moving felt more like my brain “executing a script of code” then a natural process. I settle into the backyard hammock, feeling especially weightless and put on my “disso playlist” The music enhancement is especially noticeable with nostalgic songs and ambient music. The song “Dragostea Din Tei” was especially fun to listen to.\n\nT+ 5:00 After a few hours of enjoying the outdoors, I decide to head inside and put on some YouTube. At this point, I am completely detached from my environment. Things around me look exactly the same, but my connection to them seems broken. When watching videos, I coincidentally stumble upon a video about “liminal spaces”. This is interesting as the sense of vague familiarity and being on the threshold of reality sums up the headspace I am in near perfectly.\n\nT+ 7:00 At this point, my brother is awake and watching TV in the living room, my interactions are completely normal. I decide to head into my bedroom and my cat yet again hops on the bed to see me. At this point, my mind’s eye to process “cutenesses” or “innate familiarity” to animals or people is gone, causing my cat to look weird . Also, I could not feel the incredibly soft fur of my cat due to extreme tactile suppression. Nonetheless, I chill with her anyways because I love my cat. I hop on the computer and play Rimworld for an hour, but put the difficulty down because I don’t want to fuck up my base whilst high as hell.\n\nT+ 14:00 The rest of the day proceeds pleasantly. The phenibut brings forth a jovial “childlike” mild euphoria. I ended up watching videos about a video game named “Kenshi” and note to myself to buy it when I return to baseline. Being the evening, Heading in, I also decided to take a shower. I light a candle and turn off all artificial lights. This is the only true “hallucinogenic” part of the experience. Between the displaced  tactile sensation of water hitting my skin and the dim light of the room was enough to throw off my mind and senses. Sitting on the shower floor, I was able to “conjure up” dark landscapes. Some examples include a rainy street at night, a blue crystalline city and a green decaying bedroom. The sound of the water would constantly change in pitch and the sensation of it hitting my skin would allow for full on kinesthetic hallucination. I ended up taking a half hour shower and had a fascinating time seeing how much I could push the “hallucinations”.\n\nT+ 18:00 It was now midnight and I decided to go to sleep. I took 2g of taurine before heading off to sleep.

My boss generously gave me 2 days off, so I wouldn't have to work 4 weeks straight, and today I had about 125mg of propylhexedrine (benzedrex extraction, so probably less but feels great still haha), 1 beer (500ml 5% abv) and some amount of diethyl ether.

I just strimmed and mowed my garden while listening to The Armed and it's one of my absolutely favourite things to do while on a bunch of drugs, especially stims.

I think the rest of this is going to be even more weird stimmed out rambling so feel free to check out now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if it was even a good idea to do benzedrex, because I had a little molly (&lt;1/2 pill, reagent tested, unknown quantity) on Friday and I've read they both need quite a long recovery time.

Does anyone have a better understanding of this? Or mixing the two together? Apparently mixing amphetamines and molly is okay (tripsit drug interaction chart puts it as low risk and synergy), and I would have considered benzedrex closest to amphetamines, because of the similarities between methamphetamine and propylhexedrine.

But from what I've read on reddit (so, not necessarily super reliable) propylhexedrine is more serotonergic and you could risk serotonin syndrome.

Also Ether is so fucking good. If you see my comments history, you'll see I've gone to bat for this drug a few times.

I took some to a work bbq on friday, my boss had some and just went: ""Wow. Oh, wow. That's better than nitrous"". Which is what I've been saying for ages now. Then some of my colleagues, who had seen me do it before and been like ""fuck that, it stinks dude"", tried it, loved it and I felt so vindicated.

Some people think it's dangerous like other inhalants, but it's been used like nitrous as a medical anaesthetic for a really long time, it's well understood and really safe.

Just stick to inhaling it, because drinking it can cause problems, and only use pure diethyl ether. Starter fluid can kill you instantly afaik, and methods of extraction from sources like this don't really work and are dangerous.

Sorry for rambling, I feel so great and love you all.

However, I want to cycle things a bit. I managed to get hold of Kratom, even though it's illegal here (Australia), but it's addictive, so I don't want to take it too often. I've tried other legal highs before, but they've all been pretty weak or just bunk, from what I can tell. Kanna is okay, but it isn't as recreational as Kava or Kratom. It's more a little bump, like coffee. 

Anyone know of any that actually work and are moderate like Kava or Kratom? I'm not looking for psychedelics or anything, but something I can take at least once a week, preferably without many health or addiction concerns. I'm not really into weed.

Edit: I have heard good and intriguing things about Indian Warrior, Dwarf Skullcap, Sakae Naa, and Zornia Latifolia, but my (albeit limited) experiments haven't had much reward. Indian Warrior has a definite effect, but it was quite mild and not that interesting. Sakae Naa was good the first time, but didn't work after that. Zornia didn't work, and I couldn't get Dwarf Skullcap. But with all these it might be because of not getting a good source or my preparation. I am sceptical stuff like Wild Dagga or Passion Flower or Damiana is anything but like a good relaxing herbal tea, which isn't what I'm looking for.

I usually only smoke a joint and always by myself in my room to relax. At first when I start smoking I get the nice body high &amp; happy feeling, but then I get into an almost mediation state and when I close my eyes I can start feeling all my nerve endings tingling and I can slowly move my “energy” through my body up and down and around in side me. When I do it some of my body parts actually spasms, like when I push the “energy” into those parts, like a leg or a foot.
It’s not a scary thing, if anything it feels nice and relaxing.

I wish I knew more what it’s called or what it means to learn more. The closest thing I can find when searching is possibly links to Energy/Chi/Qi &amp; Taoism, but still not really sure how I’m accessing it through smoking weed.

Hope this makes sense to some people.

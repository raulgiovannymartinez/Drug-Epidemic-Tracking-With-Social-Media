I’m starting to get skinny so I decided to take a few. It knocked me out. It put me in this state where I was sleeping and aware of the fact that I was asleep at the same time. I could wake myself up instantly if I wanted to. Eventually I started hallucinating black and white images with my eyes closed. I would call this the highest level of hypnagogia. One of the hallucinations that I remember was a perfect reflection of my own sleeping face. I also had the sensation of seeing with my eyes closed. Although I was in my living room I could see a recreation of my bedroom through my eyelids. It was exactly like laying on my bed staring at my wall but colorless and in the wrong room. Occasionally random objects would fade in and out of the scene. 

Has anyone ever had a similar experience with this substance? It was not a one time anomaly for me. I have been able to recreate similar experiences.

Cyproheptadine is a very strong antihistamine (it puts you to sleep). It is powerful serotonin receptors antagonist. It is sold under the brand name Periactin.

I had an amazing time and hands down one of the best trips I’ve had, but sometime during it I got this very strong urged in my head to tell myself “this is the last time”. So, I decided for that to be my last trip for a while and take some time to utilize everything I took away from the previous trips and better myself. 

Fast forward 6 months, and I’ve noticed I really over analyze everything. From social interactions I have with others to a simple mistake or action I do throughout the day. It makes me feel like I can’t really open up and communicate and connect with people or myself like I used to. 

Could this just be typical anxiety or is it something deeper that I gotta work through?

Next day on Thursday took 10 I think, God know why. I still had mush brain. Then Friday I think I only took 2mg, Saturday I took about 7mg, Sunday I didn't take anything. Monday now I felt a bit anxious so I took 2mg so far and I'll go up to 4mg of needed and then just stop for the rest of the week. 

Will that be long enough to get over any W/Ds since this is a very short term binge? Will there not be much of a withdrawal? I can't even take my ADHD meds during this time since they increase anxiety so I hope to get back to normal ASAP.

While I watching American Dad I just kept finding reasons to relate to life. Each episode would make me remember growing up when both family Guy and American dad were starting out. Playing day of defeat 1.3b on a pentium 4. Crazy details. Then it would be time to sleep and get up for school. 

And that its probably time I try to clear up my life once again. Damn lsd just opens your eyes. Plus the lines my hand is making as I swoosh around the phone is amaaaaaaaaazing right now.

Now I have a tolerance to Ambien. I haven't had a black out from it in ages.
So I... Snorted 20mg.

Now I just lay in bed watching more American Dad. But now the stimulant feeling is dying out. And I just get cozy. I know Ambien is dimming out the stims.

What you’ll need are (gabapentin, cyclobenzaprine, omeprazole, and finally clonazepam) 

You will need the following dosages 

1500mg gabapentin
20mg cyclobenzaprine
40mg omeprazole
0.5-2mg clonazepam

The first dosage will be a mix of 600mg gabapentin and 20mg cyclobenzaprine you need to take them while eating greasy foods (anything that is high in calories and has excessive oils) when taking this dose you will need to wash/swallow the pills with carbonated soda (Pepsi, Sprite, Coca Cola etc.). For the remaining doses you’ll need to wait 30-60 minutes between the doses and do this step every time you take a dose. 

The second dose will be 300mg of gabapentin also with greasy food and carbonated soda. Do the same thing you did with the first dose, take the pills while eating and swallow the pills with the carbonated soda 

Third dose will be 300mg of gabapentin and 40mg omeprazole, what the omeprazole does is raise the blood levels for pills and specially the clonazepam. 

Fourth dose will be 300mg of gabapentin 

After you’ve taken the last dose of gabapentin and you waited 30-60 minutes between each dose and ate greasy food with the dose and swallowed the pills with the carbonated soda you are 90% done with everything now it’s time to take the clonazepam. I usually wait 30 minutes after taking the last dose and then I take the clonazepam with carbonated soda. The high will feel amazing and it’s similar to opioids and even better. Most if not all will pass out and even blackout while doing this guide, but if you want to keep the high going for much longer I recommend some nicotine so you don’t fall asleep easily. 

This concludes the high and I hope that you enjoyed me talking about it. 

I also don’t recommend you do this every day because you need your tolerance to reset so you can feel the same effects. I usually wait around 4 days and redo

Just kind of posting this to see who else is out there because I feel so alone in this. 

I guess it all started last December when I was taking \~30mg of vyvanse every couple days during finals season. I'd take vyvanse, study all day, then take an advilpm with 25mg of benadryl to help me fall asleep and counteract the vyvanse. Then at home over winter break, my sleep got really screwed. I'd put my phone down at 5/6am and be tossing and turning until I'd finally fall asleep around 7-8am. Beginning of January, I took the few advilpm's I'd brought home with me, so nothing too much or nightly. Then starting mid-January back at college is when it got bad.

I told myself I'd just finish the bottle of advil pm, but then I went and bought a bottle of 50mg DPH pills marketed as sleep aids. January-end of Feburary I'd just take 50mg a night. Beginning of March my tolerance was building up, so I'd take 100mg a night. Flash forward to mid-March, I leave college because of corona. Still taking 100mg a night, occasionally taking 150mg if I was feeling really sad and didn't want to be awake for a while. Beginning of April, i'm at 150mg a night and have gone through many bottles of DPH. Now, end of June, I'm at 275mg a night, nearing 300mg. I know I need to stop, but I don't always want to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm addicted to the sedated feeling of benadryl to fall asleep. Since January, I've only not taken benadryl a few nights (but I had blacked out from drinking so...). I tried one night to not take any but I didn't sleep at all. I took 100mg mid day to get rid of the shitty feelings, but I didn't sleep again until i had taken 200 more mg's at 6am over 24 hours after i hadn't take any. Even after taking the 200mg, i had awful withdrawal symptoms. My body was shaking, i had awful cold sweats, i couldn't move i was so lightheaded. If I don't take the Benadryl, my brain just doesn't stop, it's like after the Vyvanse my brain just became constantly wired (i know that's not really why haha), no matter how tired my body is. I need to be completely unable to use my brain and it basically shut down from the benadryl to be able to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I now black out essentially every night from it. I do stuff, message people, eat junk, and have no memory of it in the morning because I'm so out of it. I facetime my friends and zone out through the whole conversation. I close my eyes for 10 minutes then reopen them and don't know what the hell just happened but i wasn't asleep. With the half-life, my body still has 100+mg's once I wake up, so it takes me an hour to even get out of bed and be able to slightly function because I'm just so tired and body is so depressed feeling. My resting heart rate is now around 90-100bpm vs 60-70 last year. It just sucks because benadryl has completely suppressed my energy even once I've woken up I never feel well rested due to shitty sleep and again, the half-life. I also feel like it's depressed my overall mood and I just never feel full of life or the same since I started taking it. It's only been 5 months and I'm almost taking 300mg a night...

I hope someone can relate to me because nobody understands this when I talk about it. It's like nobody really grasps how awful it is and sometimes I wish it was like xanax or oxy so people would be slightly concerned about this...haaha",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,690019,public,confidence,self,Benadryl/ DPH Addiction?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hhsee7/benadryl_dph_addiction/,,no_ads,0.0,1593429804.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and my psychiatrist only gave me an option between Dexedrine and Vyvanse. I opted for Dexedrine because it’s cheaper, but I didn’t end up liking it. To be frank it didn’t do much for me at all but suppress my appetite. I initially asked him if I could try Adderall but he told me to stick between these two. I was wondering what I could say to him to get him to give me Adderall? Is there anyone here that got positive results with Adderall but didn’t get the desired effect with Dexedrine or Vyvanse. If so, under what circumstances did you make the switch (cause Dexedrine and Vyvanse weren’t working for you).

Also, I talked to my family physician and told him that I‘m taking dexedrine but it wasn’t working for me and then I asked him for another medication recommendation. To which he automatically said Vyvanse. Does anybody know why these guys are so reluctant to give adderall? I’m in Canada by the way. Specifically Alberta.

By the way I titrated my dosage. First day took 10mg, second day took 20mg, third day took 30mg. I’m not feeling the difference. Should I up my dosage to 40 mg?

Some background information. I'm quite young and started smoking a couple of years ago, and it was an occasional thing. In the past year or so it has become a weekly activity for me, (I try to keep it at only once a week for health reasons). I eat healthily and make sure to stay active and I don't smoke anything else, and other substance usage is at a minimum.

Recently I have wanted to keep smoking more weed because it helps my anxiety so fucking much and it feels like nothing else matters when I'm high. It also helps me to fill this lonely gap I have in my life.

However I feel immensely guilty every time I smoke because I don't know what effects it will have on my developing brain and my lungs (two big concerns that I have with my weed use). Does anyone know how many bad effects there are from weekly usage or what this could possibly do to me? Weed has really helped me mentally but I don't know if I'm blowing this out of proportion or if it will have really bad impacts long term. 

I guess I just want to know what people think or if anyone has any similar experiences, or what effects long term usage  has had on people. I am not expecting any professional advice here I just want to know what people think because this is something that really worries me.

I had pooped before so I thought I was prepared. After about 20 minutes I stood up and had to fart, and figured it was long enough that I could squeeze a tooter out. 

Just as I pulled my pants up and fart all in one swift motion, there was a rush of liquid poo that came screaming out of my ass. Had no time to react, and I ended up messing all up in my jeans. 

I stood there in disbelief for a second, wondering if my molly had absorbed or I had wasted it on a glorified enema. As I cleaned up the carnage, which consisted of trying to carefully take the shit pants off and tossing my underwear in shame and taking a shower; I get smacked by what I can only say is the hardest and cleanest come up I have ever experienced. 

I hop out the shower and finish cleaning my mess, barely able to see through my teeth chattering and eyes wiggling. As I stood there, I became enlightened. I stared into the mirror and smiled at myself, took a picture, and labeled it “the newest god on the block” and I walked back over to my friends place where we were rolling at and proceed to tell everyone how shitting my pants made me feel invincible. 

To this day I remember that the whole bathroom experience that night made me a more confident and less anxious person in a small way. 

Silliest way to come to a revelation but it was a good one to have. I’m sure most of this is rambling nonsense but I wanted to tell a stupid story and hopefully it made some of y’all smile.

I started an internship two weeks ago and was drug tested for it. Completely routine, although I didn't know I'd be tested until a week and a half beforehand. I was using carts almost everyday until I knew I'd be tested, and I stopped immediately once I knew. I ended up still testing positive for weed and only kept my job because my boss is my friend's dad who's known me for about 7 years and could vouch for me, or else I would've been let go immediately like the others at the office who failed their drug tests before me.\n\nI feel incredibly lucky to be able to continue working there, not just for the money but for the experience that'll allow me to get other internships and jobs in the future. However, given the current state of the world, and the US specifically, I'm extremely overwhelmed and anxious. Sometimes, it would be nice to go home and just take a hit off the cart or smoke a bowl and relax. I don't even want to do it during the week, only on Friday's and Saturday's when I can sleep in the next day. \n\nThe reason I made this post isn't because I want someone to tell me to find something to replace the weed for calming myself down.

I started an internship two weeks ago and was drug tested for it. Completely routine, although I didn&amp;#39;t know I&amp;#39;d be tested until a week and a half beforehand. I was using carts almost everyday until I knew I&amp;#39;d be tested, and I stopped immediately once I knew. I ended up still testing positive for weed and only kept my job because my boss is my friend&amp;#39;s dad who&amp;#39;s known me for about 7 years and could vouch for me, or else I would&amp;#39;ve been let go immediately like the others at the office who failed their drug tests before me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel incredibly lucky to be able to continue working there, not just for the money but for the experience that&amp;#39;ll allow me to get other internships and jobs in the future. However, given the current state of the world, and the US specifically, I&amp;#39;m extremely overwhelmed and anxious. Sometimes, it would be nice to go home and just take a hit off the cart or smoke a bowl and relax. I don&amp;#39;t even want to do it during the week, only on Friday&amp;#39;s and Saturday&amp;#39;s when I can sleep in the next day. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason I made this post isn&amp;#39;t because I want someone to tell me to find something to replace the weed for calming myself down. I understand that and have already done so. And I imagine everyone here understands the beauty of a nice bowl on a Friday night after working your 40 hours for the week. I was told, when meeting with my boss after he convinced them not to fire me, that I could still be subjected to random drug tests. I&amp;#39;m not the least bit surprised by this, and feel as though because I&amp;#39;m an intern &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; already failed a drug test, there&amp;#39;s a much higher likelihood of them randomly drug testing me. I don&amp;#39;t want to risk it and smoke, but god damn it I do want to smoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think? I&amp;#39;m currently on a complete detox to clear my system so that if I were asked to take another test I would test negative, but I kind of want to see if there&amp;#39;s any point in the next 3.5 months (the length of my internship) when I can get with the guys and just enjoy a nice joint or something of that nature.

I’ve used over 20 different substances since I was 15 and it’s taken it’s toll on me mentally had also made me have a tougher personality. I know it’s looked down upon to take so many drugs with a developing brain but I think the key to it is to see them as a tool that you use for different situations. These days, I’ve been trying to quit pills because in the past year I’ve been taking ecstasy monthly and using oxy on the come down. Ecstasy has made me have less anxiety overall but I’m trying to get my serotonin back.

The thing about harder drugs is that people try taking them thinking they’re not going to get depressed in some way. The problem about these drugs is they will 100% give you some type of depression because you are chemically not going to enjoy things as much as if you were on drugs. Sleeping isn’t the same without opiates, doing work isn’t the same without stims, loving isn’t the same without molly. Even regular life isn’t the same after taking shrooms or lsd because you see everything different. You won’t care about stuff as much as other people. It’s a blessing and a curse. For me, I haven’t suffered in school and my relationship with my parents hasn’t really suffered that much so I’m lucky. But quitting the harder drugs is what I’m trying to do so I can be happy for my family and enjoy my last year living with them.

Since then I’ve only taken one T break which lasted a month because I had to ( to avoid trouble ). I’ve also used quite a bit of LSD recently about 5-8 trips this year but I digress. I realized I went overboard on my psychedelic use and I am beginning to think I smoke too much also. 

The problem is I seriously can’t stop. I live in a area where everyone smokes pot even though it’s illegal ( I’m sure you can guess where ) and I have a full cart that makes it 10x harder to stop and I’m always buying more when I already have enough. I’m done spending so much money on it but I can’t even get through one day without seriously stopping to consider smoking before I inevitably smoke before bed.

i say ""recently,"" tbh its only happened twice now that i know of. a couple weeks ago he woke up the entire house in the middle of the night screaming about how there was someone in the garden trying to break in, and ran out the house to chase them. he was doing this for almost two hours, diving into bushes and running through fields and gardens after a group of people ""wearing camo."" he said there were drag marks in the field outside our house where hed seen them dragging something up the hill (there wasnt) and he started yelling at a blue light in the distance which he swore was them, which turned out to be a ship several miles away. he claimed they were making donkey noises to try and pretend like they werent there, but they were bad donkey noises and he could hear them chuckling anyway (i could not hear any of this). he moved in with his girlfriend shortly after this, furious neither i nor our mum believed there were actually people there, and his girlfriend just messaged me like an hour ago in a panic about him doing the exact same thing again. hes apparently running around the place, saying theres people breaking in, and hes been digging into the sofa saying someones hiding in there and making his girlfriend guard the front door so they dont escape. when she and their mutual friend, who is also there, tried to tell him there was no one trying to break in, he once again started getting extremely aggro about it and refused to listen to them. by the time i saw the message, hed apparently started to calm down, and she doesnt want me over there anymore because shes afraid hell start thinking hes under attack or being persecuted or something and do something stupid

now, the first time he was like this, he could have been taking any manner of pills. he popped xannies to get to sleep and i thought it might have interacted with something else, since hes 25 now and been taking both cocaine and xannax since his teens without ever having something so dramatic happen. this time, though, his girlfriend is pretty sure he only took cocaine, and it was last night when he took it. she actually offered xannies AFTER hed already started acting the mickey because she thought it might get him to settle down, so i dont reckon its some kinda xanny overdose/opoid interaction. honestly though i wouldnt know

* This is really just a post to warn people who are new to weed and specifically new to edibles. Also if someone has some advice for me to keep in mind for the future, feel free to reply to this* 

*Trigger warning ⚠️: mentions of anxiety, panic attacks, fear of death/dying*

I’m someone who has been smoking weed for a little over two years now. Smoking is my main method of consumption but I’ve had edibles as well. Last night, however, I had the worst experience with edibles and I think it was so bad that I’m scared off from using any form of drugs in the future or at least experimenting. 

Any edible I’ve had is usually in the form of a rice krispy treat or brownie so I usually know to only take no more than 2 or 3 little bites (usually consuming less than half at one time). So when I had these gummies, I felt like I was being pretty responsible. 

My guy told me to take no more than 7 in order to feel something. These gummies were small as well. I’d say smaller than regular gummy bears so I assumed 7 would be enough. I had 6. I took two at a time and drank water in between each time, giving around 5-10 minutes between each time I took some. Looking back, 6 was way too many &amp; 3 probably would’ve been a good place to stop. I didn’t know how much were in each gummy but I genuinely found it impossible that these tiny ass gummies would fuck me up as bad as they did by just having 6. 

At the start, my high was really good. Super euphoric. It wasn’t like any high I had experienced in awhile &amp; that was red flag number one for me bc it was so strong I was doubtful it was *just* cannabis. But that soon didn’t matter because i was having a good time. 

Then suddenly I had this sensation that something had dropped/fell on my arm and it surprised me but that’s when everything started to go wrong. That feeling of shock morphed into fear and anxiety and I started panicking. I called a friend and they calmed me down for around 30 minutes. I had no concept of time. 5 minutes felt like 20 minutes. 20 minutes felt like an hour. I was trying to talk a lot of distract myself from the anxiety I was feeling but I was so scared my heart was going to explode bc it was beating so fast. I genuinely thought I was going to die and I had so much guilt that I would traumatize my friend and my family because of this. 

Eventually, I told my friend that I felt like I needed my older sister to help me out. That gave me more anxiety because she was sleeping and is currently taking online classes and I didn’t want to disturb her but I still did anyway. That lasted until around 12:30 am maybe I don’t really have any recollection of when I finally feel asleep besides my sister sending me annoyed &amp; angry text messages at around 1:30 am but I was finally asleep by then. 

To sum it up, I feel terrible and embarrassed and disappointed in myself. I’m usually very responsible &amp; know my limits and I never push myself when it comes to weed and alcohol. I wouldn’t say my tolerance is high but it’s not low &amp; I have never reacted to weed this way especially when I was under normal conditions (in my room, relaxed, hydrated, had food in my stomach, etc).

I don’t really feel comfortable with the idea that I “consumed too much” because I have gotten sick or had bad reactions to eating too much of an edible in the past. That just resulted in queasiness, a headache, or the need to shit everything I ate. Does anyone else think that what I had might’ve been laced or had other things in it? I’m really concerned by the way I reacted &amp; I would really like to know if what I experienced is similar to reactions from other drugs. I’ve only ever had weed and drink alcohol.

&amp;#x200B;

So I had withdrawals from benzos (Xanax) around 3 months ago. This consisted of tremors, severe insomnia, bad dreams, cold sweats, chest pain, extreme anxiety, migraines etc. This lasted for a week and i was 80% back to my normal level of functioning with very minor symptoms persisting. My symptoms were entirely gone after a fortnight. I'd been abusing Xanax for a short period (2 weeks to a month max) but at very high doses. The tremors were so severe over the first 2 days i thought I may have a seizure but I dont think that happened (unless it happened while I slept which I highly doubt). I'm aware that during Xanax withdrawal the seizure risk is very, very high but I'm concerned if that seizure risk remains after having not used the substance for months.

&amp;#x200B;

I've obtained 500mg of Tramadol and I intend on taking 200-250mg of it since I believe this range to be a sensible range for recreational use, low risk for inducing seizures and because I have no opiate tolerance.

Is this wise granted my history with benzos? If any of you know about the seizure potential please advise.

First night, I grinded up half an eighth of psychedelic mushrooms into powder and made tea with about 2 cups of water. Took about 30 minutes to hit me on an empty stomach. Great trip, no nausea, decent visuals not too strong, pretty intense emotional/body high. Overall good experience. Fast forward to the next day, I didn’t feel like storing and risk losing potency so I decided to take the 2nd half. Really bad idea. I read about tolerance and time needed to return to baseline and all that. Figured there was no way I’d be able to reach the same intensity as the day before. Boy was I wrong. This time I decided to lemon tek the 2nd half. Within 5-10 minutes I fell into probably the most intense awful trip of my life. I immediately knew I had fucked up and took 2mg of Klonopin to settle me down. I fainted several times from how intense the trip was, and proceeded to vomit for the entire length of the trip and honestly felt like I was going to die. Not saying this will happen to anyone looking to trip two days in a row. Lessons learned, everyones tolerance levels are different and never underestimate the power of psychedelics.

Working on quitting currently.

Since I’ve taken phenibut I’ve noticed almost no drugs work at all.

I’ve never abused any other drug besides phenibut and kratom, and I’ve only ever taken other drugs a handful of times. All of the below drugs used to work perfectly fine before abusing phenibut.

All of the below drugs do not work regardless of dose. They all result in this pressure in my head, it makes my head foggy and I feel crappy. Almost like an adderall comedown.

1. Cocaine
2. Mdma
3. Ritalin
4. Magic my shrooms
5. Meth (tried it twice, didn’t work, Won’t ever touch it again)
6. Benzedrex inhaler (again, only tried once)
7. Kanna (Mild serotonin drug, legal)

None of them work. All of them will produce some kind of mild effect, but there is absolutely zero euphoria and they all just make me feel bad. Mdma will sort of work, but no euphoria. I’ve only done mdma about 4-5X in my life and it used to be unbelievably euphoric.

Anyone have any idea why this is? 20MG of adderall used to get me high as a kite. Now if I take adderall nothing happens, my heart rate will increase, and I’ll become slightly stimulated but no increase in actual energy and no euphoria. Caffeine is better.

Caffeine does still work, so do benzos, and opioids do a little bit. I don’t really mess with opioids though. I was given IV dilaudid in the hospital and morphine and all it did was sedated me. No euphoria.

I’ve read of paradoxical effect of drugs. The wiki article states that it has something to do with the gaba receptors. No idea if this is related, but it’s the only thing I could find that has any relevance to my situation.

I’m in my very early 20s. I’ve battled things from depression, anxiety and a handful of other things I can throw in there. 

On top of all of this, I have a hard time valuing life and just wish I wouldn’t wake up when I fall asleep. I have zero accomplishments, and I quite mean that literally. Unemployed and uneducated as I couldn’t make it past HS. I know that it’s not because I am “stupid”, but for some reason that is another part that plays into me why I feel the way I do. I’m even told I should model, and I know I am a good looking guy, but I can’t even look at myself in the mirror. I haven’t had social media for at least a half decade, and barely even have pictures of myself. People just think I’m mysterious. I feel alienated. 

I feel guilty for wasting potential. The opportunities I have wasted because of my mental illnesses. The opportunities I am wasting now and will continue to because of my mental illnesses and now drug abuse. 

I grew up in an environment where there was heavy drug use, and I’ve seen multiple people OD in front of me, due to this I never drank/smoke or anything drug related as a kid/teen despite being around it. 

But now in my 20s after thinking I had the toxicity in my head under control during my youth, I am completely lost more than I could have imagined. 

I only enjoy getting high, and it’s crazy to me because I never imagined it’d be me. But it’s my only escape. I look back thinking, how hopeless I must’ve been to start doing what I am doing. I also got into a serious relationship for over a year, which is another thing I was against. I was just hoping she’d make me see the colors in the world but I never thought about the hurt that would be passed on from her to me. My gut tells me she isn’t good for me, but I’m scared to miss out on what could be and how that could be my escape. The toxicity from all of this, on top of my natural toxicity I feel is killing me. 

When first using, I wouldn’t really take beginner amounts. I’d basically take a mix of certain drugs and/or alcohol to completely black me and in hopes I wouldn’t wake up. Now I hardly ever blackout and if I do it usually isn’t on purpose, and never try to end my life with them. But I know that it’s still a possibility which adds to it for me. The more I use, the more I learn about the side effects and it’s scary. Yet the drugs I do are the only escape. But I feel most of the time from what I can remember is that even while high, I’m still sad.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,689813,public,confidence,self,Young guy looking for wisdom,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hhezo1/young_guy_looking_for_wisdom/,,no_ads,0.0,1593382202.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I look at him as if he has 12 heads and I was just like, “oh okay I’ll let him in now. Thanks Man, yeah yeah yeah thanks dude.  Thanks” (with a tone that says get the fuck off my property).  

I don’t know, I’m tripping out that I left my dog out there for extra long and my neighbor now knows I’m essentially a junkie in his eyes, I don’t even think I did.  My last text was at 6 pm to my friend and I think I had taken my dog for a walk and gotten back around then.  If my dog was outside between 6-8 (which isn’t abnormal)... I don’t see that being an issue with a gated backyard, I wasn’t in fear of falling asleep or I would’ve made sure I literally had my only friend near me.

Thoughts:

Overall this is a very dysphoric and unpleasant drug I wouldn't recommend to anyone. No matter how desperate you are, do NOT try this stuff at home. ALWAYS get a physician to prescribe this if you're in the market.

This drug isn't psychoactive in any fun sense, but it definitely fucks up my cognition as much as a shot or two of liquor would.

My cancer is in remission and has stayed that way, so I think I got my money's worth out of this god-forsaken substance.

I’ve never been a huge user, but did it quite a bit back in college, and even today i’ll occasionally be down to join in if its around during a good night of drinking.

I’ve had good shit before so its not like its bc I’ve only done shitty coke, and I have good friends who have told me how great THEY think it is - one buddy in college in particular - I remember him saying while we were discussing this, and he told me how he’ll always remember the way he felt the first time he ever did it - “The second I did that shit... I said yup. There it is. Thats what I been lookin’ for!”

Idk not me though - just always felt kinda meh
Overrated and overpriced in my opinion, but even beyond that, I wonder if maybe its a physical thing that comes to brain chemistry and it just doesn’t click w me like it does so many other people.

Personally, I’ve always felt that way about adderall, “thats what I’ve been lookin for!” and I know thats not exactly the norm - especially when compared to the worlds notorious love for blow, Im definitely in the minority there.

so maybe its just a different strokes different folks kinda thing, but I wonder more and more if it really just comes down to brain chemistry and that alone when it comes to the kinds of chemical substances we are all uniquely hard wired to love.

But anyways, is there anyone else out there that doesn’t really get that intense pleasurable experience from it that so many others seem to?

This was the wildest experience I'ce ever had; since this occured I have generally avoided psychedelics (though I will definitely return to them in the future(

It all started with me ingesting roughly 180 micrograms of LSD. Honestly, I can't say I remember much about the trip before I decided to smoke DMT. All I remember is stepping into my closet at around 4 hours in, loading it with basically all that I had (roughly .3 - .5) and taking as many hits as possible.

Something very; very strange began to happen. The patterns began to intensify and intensify to an unfathomable magnitude with each hit I took. The pipe began to look like a shimmering, effervescent orb; it was almost like I was seeing all angles of the end at once. 

My memory blacks out for a second here (I have no idea how many hits I took, but it was enough to almost completely clear the pipe). 

The next thing I remember is floating above my head, as if I were a disembodied spirit. Somehow, I could see through the closet door, through the closed blinds of my window, and through the fence, far, far out into the sky. Although this trip occured at night, somehow, the outside looked like it was daytime. There was this strong light illuminating everything. Then, this self transforming pattern began to stir in the furthest reaches, outside of what I could see. It flowed over the long grass as it blowed in the wind, transforming them into geometric patterns as well.

I heard a voice. It was telling me, more in feelings than in words: ""Is this what you wanted? You wanted the most intense experience. Here it is. It's only just begun.""

My memory fails me here again. The next thing I remember is hurtling at the speed of light through this whirling geometric tunnel. It felt like some kind of cosmic blood vessel, I don't know how else to describe the warmth and relative ""dimness"" of the place.

I burst through a membrane of some kind. There is a distinct, odd noise, like a zipper being pulled at a high speed. 

Now, I was hurtling through the DMT dimension. It was too fast, I wasnt slowing down like I had in previous trips. Enties raced with me, laughing (?) and smiling and waving at me. Those are the words I use for lack of anything better. They looked as though they were made of some impossibly fine jewels, constantly undulating and transforming themselves. I always had the distinct feeling that these entities are actually people (or their souls). I( know this sounds insane, but I have had several experiences where entities show me memories from their lives)

I fly by a jeering, bejeweled jester-looking creature. His hat looked like it was forged of rubies, but it was impossibly perfect. I turn to my right to look at him more clearly. Suddenly, without warning, I am sucked into a portal (or vortex, or wormhole) of some kind.

Yes. I experienced a breakthrough, *within a breakthrough*.

Again, blindingly fast, I am hurtled through a celestial artery. This one, however, contained no patterns, and in further contrast to the earlier tunnel, it was very bright. This brightness increased the further I traveled, until everything was encompassed in a blinding white light.

I feel myself finally come to rest. No more movement. I feel as though I can somewhat sense that I have a human body at this point. I am still fully inside the experience, it just now feels as though my conciousness is in the ""shape"" of a human again, rather than being a sphere.

I feel as though I am sitting cross-legged, though I cannot see my body when I look down. Everything was just pure, white light. I look up-

and I am filled with an emotion I can't describe. Cosmic horror? Amazement? Terror? I don't know the word.

High up and to the right of my vision was this giant... I don't know the word. It was shaped exactly like a sperm cell, except it was HUGE, so big and intimidating that I felt it would swallow me whole just by being in its presence. But its substance.. it was like this black smoke, but thicker, like it was CGI, but a CGI designed and run on an alien supercomputer.. that is the only way I can describe this ""substance"". This smoke was constantly morphing and shaping into *billions* of different things. i saw a lot of faces, but also, it was like I was witnessing all of human history as I gazed into it... so much suffering, death, war, bloodshed. There were good moments within it as well, but the ""vibe"" from it was definitely dark... or anguished. It swam past me, swimming faster and faster at an exponential rate and going further and further into the horizon, seemingly into this tiny, shimmering white dot until-

there is this huge explosion. So much energy released, it was like being in the center of a million nuclear blasts, or being present for the big bang. I am now in a white place again, but less bright. This being approaches me. It is huge as well. It was female, I instantly recognized it as The Goddess.. an embodiment of all loving experiences, all bliss and pleasure, the experiences were like beads in her hair. Her face was not human, though her figure was humanoid. I cannot remember much else about what she looked like or what was said to me.

Next thing I know, I'm being led by her to this pedestal. On it was a large book, bound in dark leather. She took her place at the right side of it (my right, that is). I realized half of my vision (and of the background) was this white light, so I looked to my left-

and instantly recognized The Godhead, or Supreme male deity. He was encompassed in shadows. He had large, black antlers like tree branches, and his head was like that of a deer.. or perhape a deer's skull.. I can't remember much else.

I remember them beckoning me to the book, on this pedestal. The open it up. There, pictured is a depiction of ""The Tree of Life"".. it had ""spheres"" like the Kabbalah, but it had many more than the Kabbalah has and all were on an actual drawing of a tree.. There were strange symbols and markings around each one. In addition, this tree had roots, which mirrored the branches, and had the same number of spheres as well as markings.

I got this distinctive feeling of an ""up arrow"". It was like it was in my mind's eye. I feel as though a voice was telling me that ""my destiny lies beyond"" or ""at great heights"".. There, looking in amazement at this book,  I instinctively ""understood"" something that I still try to grasp at, in vain. I was there for eternity, overwhelmed with an emotion like deja vu, with these gods on either side of me, and this eternal secret (or answer) before my eyes. 

After this eternity somehow passed, the experience slowly faded away. The tree was the last thing I saw, before it slowly faded into this painting that was propped up in my closet. It was a simple painting of a vase of flowers. The acid was gone. I sat there, shocked beyond belief, and shaking a little before checking the time... it had been no more than 5 minutes.


This experience still weirds me out and makes me slightly uncomfortable to think about, it has definitely put me off of any large doses or serious trips for a good while. Also, this happened roughly 2 years ago. 



Thanks for reading. I know this is long. I'd appreciate any insight into it or other trip reports if anyone has experienced something similar. In any case, this is why my username is what it is :)

So when i was younger i used to use a lot of drugs and smoke weed, i smoked weed for about a year and a half and then started using molly, cocaine and sometimes dxm. It started becoming a regular thing with molly, amphetamines and cocaine and id go on binges of them every weekend while smoking weed everyday, using very high doses. Then i tried dph which i took in an insane dose for no tolerance (900 mg) and my heart was going insane for atleast 10 hours and ever since then ive been getting very scary symptoms such as heart palpitations, chest pains and tingling in my body. It always came with bad anxiety too, i had to quit smoking weed because my anxiety was too bad. i stayed sober off everything except nicotine and the odd adderall. Then i started using molly again very frequently like 3 or 4 times a week usually a half gram or a gram to myself and i did this for about 3 months, sometimes using cocaine or acid. Then i started smoking weed again but it was always giving me severe anxiety and chest pains and heart palpitations so after maybe 4 months i quit. But i started smoking weed again and my anxiety and chest pains started getting worse and then it grew onto getting head aches, heaviness feeling in my right side of my body (no weakness though it just felt very off), blurred vision, problems with balance on right side and tremors. These symptoms always come with very severe anxiety though that makes me feel like im going to drop dead.

I went to the doctor a lot of times and they ran tons of tests. Including ecg’s, Heart moniter, ultrasound on heart, chest xray, ct scan on head showing the blood flow in my brain.

So as you can already tell by the title of this post, your buddy hoGnjen wants to share with you his experience sniffing EU paste and possibly Mephedrone for 5 days straight so far. He's a bit foggy and his thoughts might seem a bit confusing, but bare with me, i'll try my best to transcribe what's going on in his head.

Day 1 - 22:30PM - ""Oh man i cannot WAIT to finish my shift and go for a beer, alright lets go, theres only 30 minutes left. YOU. GOT. THIS. 

\*phone rings\* Message from ""Little Bro"": Hey, call me asap

""Yo wassup?""

""Broski i got something real nice for you, wanna link up""

""Duuuude.... Alright, call ya in 20ish minutes""

Goddamn I can't get a break from drugs. \*Monologue done\*

So after i finished my shift i met up with my broski to see whats up. He's in a hurry so he just quickly gives me the little baggy with some rocks inside and was on his way. I open it and there are 10 or such white rocks which were smelly af. Like cat piss type of smell. Anyhow, I meet up with my friends, we go to a local bar and ordered a few drinks. When we got our beers i just quickly got up and went for a quick ""bathroom break"". Dropped 1 rock the size of my pinky nail. Chop chop chop, the thing was just piling up and piling up, i couldn't believe how much product fell out of that one little rock. It was a huge one guys. Once it went up my nose I immediately shed a tear from both eyes lol. It burned sooooo good.

I went back to the table rushing my tits off, this shit was jet fuel. I was red in the face, still wiping tears off my face and breathing heavily. I explained that i just had an enormous shit, nothing to worry about :)

We finished our beers and went our separate ways. \*Phone rings again\*

Day 2 - 24:45

""Yooooo dude wassup, you in town?""

""Yeah man, im a couple of minutes away from your block actually""

""Sick, come over and bring some papers""

""Aight""

I went over to Danny's place, he's parents are on vacation so there was always something going on at that apartment, sat on my designated seat (on the PC cuz i HAVE TO choose the music) and gave them the surprise sweets I had. There was of us, only Danny boi and 1 other guy were gonna try it. I warned them to not rack up big lines, its powerful stuff.

""Naah bro this looks like shit"" - Danny, famous last words.

He racks us up 3 huge ass rails (yet I still have like 0.7g's left, mind you) and Danny sniffs half and stops to cover his nose and eyes from the immense pain he just felt. It looked like a slap to the face lol

Day 3 - 9:00AM

Okay, so nothing interesting is really going on at this point. We're just smoking jays, listening to drum n bass, rambling about absolute randomness and horseshit, so at around 9:30AM i leave to go home, still have like half a g left. I got home, laid in bed, couldn't sleep at all, so instead I played some Project Reality BF2 until like 12:00AM. Snorted a couple more, still had 3 rocks left. Afterwards i ate my first meal at around 5PM, after 18 or so hours. Could barely eat it, but i had no choice.

At around 19:00PM i went out again to Danny's place.

Okay so this is when it get's weird. At Danny's they copped even more of this stuff, like 10 more g's. The same 3 guys and Danny's girl who i forgot to mention were still on it from the previous day, and the best part is that the dude who weren't gonna try it ended up buying 10g's off of my little bro an hour before I came the the apartment. This place was a mess tho. So much beer bottles, ashtrays filled with roaches. Truly beautiful. Brings me back to uni. Anyway, this is the third day of my bender. Can't remember if i had any sleep for those 3 days, maybe a few power naps but that it.

Okay, so the musics blasting, everyones our of their mind, some new people show up, everyones chatting, me and Danny are talking absolute shite while im trying my best make everyone a line. My hands were trembling so much lol

Lines are racked on a plate, which is goin in a circle of 10 people, alongside a 2 huge ass joints. BONKERS!!!

I've not smoked up until this point, so once the joints hit me I started hallucinating visually and auditory. I was so out of it that i was convinced that this one guy didn't pay me for a gram of coke he never asked for lol. That was one of the many incidents that night. I also felt really weak at one point, like I would stand up after sitting down for 30 minutes and would almost faint or even fall down. That was scary tho.

Day 4 - 6:00AM

Were out of drugs, alcohol and weed.... Everyone went home except Danny's girl and one other guy. I'm fiending like crazy so i hit up my lil bro again to see if he's up.

""Yooo don't tell me I woke you up...""

""Nah im awake, wassup?""

""Any help?""

""You at Danny's?""

""Ye :D""

""I'll be there in less than 30 mins, you got any cash?""

\*10 second pause\* 

""Yea not really, i can give you the cash tomorrow, just come over and we'll talk""

An hour passes, ofc, and Broski has arrived. At this point we were outside of Danny's building and we were sitting on a bench near the entrance of his building. We go upstairs to his place and he tells us this isn't speed paste that he's got.

""This is a new batch, it's gonna be around for a while. Take a look""

I'm looking at a bunch of yellow powder mixed with a 4-5 fat rocks. I immediately think this is horse, the fuck is wrong with you.

""No bro, this stuff is ""Miau Miau"" (in our language, but it's just Mephedrone).

""I'm not taking this shit man, sorry.""

Danny yells out:

""NONONO WE'LL TAKE ALL OF IT, I'LL GIVE YOU 50 EUROS FOR ALL OF IT""

Day 5 - 7:07AM

Fast forward to now, which is Day 5 - 7:07AM. We ended up buying that shit, which was in fact Mephedrone, sniffed 3 out of the 5 grams we got..... Never again. I have no idea what im even writting about anymore, i think that 70% of the story is accurate and the point of this post is: Don't overdo it, not just drugs, anything. 

Now i've got 2g's of MCAT that i dont wanna do, i'll try and find someone who want's it. I just wanna go to bed..

Basically felt super uncomfortable, felt stuck in time, and everything tripped me out. Can’t really put it into words but it was hell.

My trip later turned good. Felt 100x more emotion then I’ve ever felt.

Throughout the trip I had many spirtual thoughts. Some of which were depressing. I saw life in a whole new perspective that I can’t really put into words. I set my ego aside, and even the ego of loved ones.

It’s extremely hard to put into words exactly what my realizations were, but I basically felt like  I was thinking straight from the soul. I thought about how we are living this temporary human experience and how the love I felt for everyone close to me had no guarantee of being infinite, and how once we die there’s no guarantee these connections will live on. I also thought how after death, wherever our energy ascends, our existence is infinite but has no set-in-stone start or finish, and that everything is much bigger then what we know here on earth, and the fact there’s no explanation for any of it or understanding of what’s to come is a very depressing thing. I remember just constantly thinking “why are we here”,” what’s the point”, “why was I put here and why does existing even matter”. It may seem like something a depressed person would think but it was more so a desire for answers. During this part of the trip I was feeling a lot of emotion. Almost feeling cursed to be alive, because it was such a scary thing to realize we actually know nothing. I was insanely frustrated at the fact that it just made no sense.

Idk if this makes any sense but it’s hard to put into words the thoughts I was having.

Very impactful stuff.

I know 300 mg is a lot but I have a very high tolerance towards it (I'm a terrible sleeper and the whole reason I got into drugs was to sleep). Pretty much a good combo for a good nights rest, tho it did make me sleep through alarm clocks, so if you want to replicate make sure you dose early on. 

My personal bedtime is usually around 10, so in order to enjoy the high I take it about an hour before I go to bed.

I will try to remember as much as possible. So I had woken up in the morning around 7 and gone to the store I have no car and it is around a 3 mile walk. I had been up all night the night before also on dxm, don’t really remember how much I had taken. Probably a third plat trip. I went to the store and bought 8 oz of delsym. I went home and drank it all. This day I unfortunately had to go on a family trip. I pretty much ruined the entire trip. I was a complete retard the entire time. I was unable to form words and looked like a complete zombie. I went to a restaurant and could not even order any food and my sister had to order for me. I felt terrible and my parents were extremely angry with me. By the time I got home I had acquired a contact for some high quality acid. I picked up half a strip, went home and popped the tabs and took a shower I chewed them up and held them in my mouth for around an hour. What happened next over the course of the night was terrifying and I almost killed myself. I blacked out and the next moment I was in my room standing up with my mother coming in to check on me asking what was wrong I could not form any sort of coherent conversation. I was sweating and pacing around my room I could not tell my mom what was wrong. After this I cannot remember very much all I remember was I was stuck in a different dimension with demons that were extremely sexual and it basically showed me that our whole lives are revolved around greed and sex and human beings are evil. I was tortured for what seemed like eternity in horrible ways that I cannot remember I just remember thinking I had died and was stuck in hell and every one was laughing at me and people were everywhere in hell screaming and raping each other. I cannot remember hardly any of the details just that it was extremely uncomfortable and horrifying and sexual. Lots of gore and rape. The next moment ir was closer to the morning. I thought that I had died and I was in purgatory I thought my dad was god. My dad came into my room and I could not recognize him. He looked like a demon with sweat pouring off of him and his voice sounded robotic. I thought he was judging me for all of my sins in my life and I was doomed for eternity I started begging him and apologizing  for everything. I don’t remember anything after this for a long time. The next morning I was basically thinking that I had died and was stuck in a dream or in another dimension. I thought I could do whatever I wanted and I thought I was a soul that had lived countless lives of pain and torture and I was doomed to live another life of pain and torture. I walked out of my room no one else was awake. I thought it was the rapture and my family along with everyone else had gone to heaven and I was the last one left on earth. I went to take a shower everything was still shaking and colors were very vibrant.  After a while I realized that it had all been a trip and now my mom and dad want me to go to rehab or na meetings.

Imma get right into it, I’ve done coke and speed before and liked them but not “too” much and since I’m a recovering heroin addict I was being cautious. Now lately my PTSD has been acting up and I did some speed. 

From there it’s kinda been going downhill, I’ve been doing speed basically every day with frequent redosing, this along with a really fucked up sleeping schedule and coke binges in the evenings a lot of the nights. (And I also smoke)


Now the good news I’ve had my heart tested (for unrelated reasons) recently and everything was totally fine, along with that this binge had only lasted about a week, have a very healthy diet and drink a lot of water so I’m probably worrying about nothing but I’m hypochondriac and I guess it’s better to be safe than sorry.


I’ll be okay mentally, I’m on an SSRI that helps me and I go to therapy weekly. I am also gonna stop doing stimulants but I was wondering how much damage I might’ve done to my heart cause the last day I’ve having some annoying shortness of breath.

I've also experienced other changes to the way weed makes me feel but I'm concerned about the visual aspect mostly.

Since then I've:
. Done acid twice
. Brokethrough on dmt 
. Done salvia 20x extract and dmt at the same time
. Taken crystal mdma a few times

It really depends on the weed and how much I smoke, it correlates with high I actually am and how quickly I take it. Bongs give me visuals every time.

The visuals don't resemble acid much at all. It's closed eye visuals on a level of threshold dmt or mdma. Although I cannot control the visual experience the  way I can while on mdma. Plenty of geometry and colour some fractals but not quite as complex as the dmt visuals they seem related too.

I also get fairly standard tracers, colour enhancenent and peripheral vision misinterpretation that linger longer than the more intense visuals.

It's quite a strange feeling and I'm going to take a short break from weed which should hopefully get rid of this.

Is this something I should be concerned about?

I'm not particularly worried as it's neither negative nor positive nor does it occur when I am sober.

Why and how could this have happened?

Is it caused by excessive use or is it just one of those things that just happens sometimes.

I'd love to hear other people's insight or personal experience into how weed may have changed after your psychedelic use?

I don’t think psychs has changed weed for me, about every other day i see people saying how much weed has changed but it doesn’t seem to be the case with me.  

I tried real acid for the first time after a month of heavy smoking and it didnt deter me from using it. In the upcoming months ive been experimenting with psychs and it really showed me how bad cigs are and how i should be healthier but no increased anxiety/paranoia with weed, in fact i love smoking to increase/bring back the intensity of a trip. 

I even had what i would say is a life changing experience whilst candyflipping, weed, ket and nitrous which completely changed my perception on reality but if anything it taught me that i love weed but i shouldn’t abuse it and should do it in moderation to actually feel the high and get its more beneficial properties (i used to smoke 3 grams/day + dabs) down to about a 1-1.5 a day now.

I just want to write. Please just tell me how to fall asleep once I’m home, I don’t have any other drugs to help aside from an edible or two which barely get me high. 

.

I took E for the first time with some friends. I haven’t taken any hard drugs in over six months since I last took amphetamine. 

It wasn’t what I expected it to be. I thought I’d be jumping around, on cloud nine. But I spent the past four hours quite calm. When I took amphetamine it was to study but I never got the dosages right so I was over amped every time and never actually studied. This feels like a perfect study buzz. 

I’m calm, quiet. I get hot and cold really fast for no reason, I was laying in my friend’s garden getting riddled with mosquito bites but that was better than baking indoors. But then I started shivering so I had to go back inside. 

I’m clenching my jaw but not as much as I thought I would. I messaged some people, apologising for things I’d done to some and telling others I love them. My arms and legs aren’t numb per se but if I don’t move them I almost forget that they’re a part of me. 

I was with my friend (M!! We’re gonna call him M) on a couch at some point. He loves classical music, Rachmaninoff mostly. So he played a piece and we listened together while we held hands and he rubbed my head, it was really nice. The comforting presence of someone you know wouldn’t hurt you for any reason; that’s really nice to have. It’s like a warm glow coming from someone’s heart. I sound mad fucked but bear with me. 

I don’t know what music to listen to right now. I don’t have him with me, my friend. I felt a lot more “stable” with him around but now I’m on a bus alone going home to a parent who’s mad at me for getting back past midnight. 


They made me have some water but I didn’t like it. I had maybe five sips and every time I took one I just got queasy. Even thinking about it now makes me feel icky, I don’t understand why. I’m definitely thirsty, my lips are sticking to my teeth and my throat is dry. But the thought of having water is just gross. 

One of my other friends (H? Let’s call him H) with a higher tolerance took two rocks(?) (they were neon green and had no particular shape, so I have no idea how to describe them. Kinda cubical but the edges were rough like it had been poorly broken up). Anyways back to the friend. He threw up while we went on a walk. I hope I don’t get to that point. My mom thinks I’ve only been drinking and she’d kill me if she found out I’ve been taking drugs. 

I’m more of a lurker here. I like to read all the harm reduction posts and bartard stories. I have no stories of my own, I don’t usually get high. Yesterday and two days before I spent hotboxing weed with friends in a toolshed, but that’s the most I’ve done recently. The wildest drug story I have is actually from the first time I met M. My school was doing some joint work with the local church for this Christmas celebration, I took music so I had to be in the choir. While we were at rehearsals I got sick of being sober and I bombed some amp in the bathroom. I met M for the first time while I was amped as hell, feeling my heartbeat in my abdominal artery. A mutual friend introduced us but at the timehe just turned away because he didn’t want to get involved with someone high hahaha. Which I can’t really blame him for. But being high on amphetamine in a Church isn’t a great first impression. 

I realise I’m rambling here but I don’t really know how to stop. I’m walking home to my apartment and I wish I could stay out later and walk. But it’s dangerous. I’m in a skirt, my town is really sketchy at night. I’m going home anyways. 

I realised a lot of my friends think I’m some hardass edgelord druggie that doesn’t care about anything. But I care about a lot. I’m the class metalhead, I’m walking around in my nowhere-near-complete battle jacket. I realise the image I have created for myself isn’t accurate. I’m reflecting on myself as a person and I realise I’m not satisfied with who I am or what I’ve done. I want to be a better person. I kinda wish people knew how much I love DnD and theatre, and baking and taking naps in the sun. I have a whole soft side that I almost never bring up for some reason. Also brb putting my phone in my pocket :D

I’m back I took off my makeup and changed into pajamas. It’s really warm, my fan is all the way up. I’m the kind of person that will sleep with a thick blanket no matter what, not because I’m nuts but because I almost need to feel something holding me to fall asleep. I feel weird without having it over me but I’ll be even warmer then. But I wish M were here. I have a crush on him for some reason. I wish we could listen to music and hold hands some more. Even though I’m warm as hell I’d make that sacrifice for him :) I’m not *in love* but I love him yknow?? I’m attached, I guess. He’s a really fun guy. A good person. 

I love this sub so much. You guys are a really fun bunch. I really like reading the essays I see on occasion. Maybe you’re like me. Whoever you are, who’s reading this. I hope you’re getting some level of enjoyment out of this :)


I think I’m gonna force myself to stop typing right about now. Theres a lot of things in my life that I’d like to change. I wish I liked getting high more. I enjoy it but theres always a certain point where I start wishing it would just end and I could go back to being sober. I guess I take too much, or maybe shouldn’t take any drugs at all. But right now, as good as I feel. I’m getting sick of the high. I want to sleep, I’m tired. 

I’d say goodnight but I’ll probably stay up longer. If you read this far, please let me know and comment. LeAvE A LiKE aNd SuBScRiBE. Really though if someone did take the time to read this shit I’d be mad impressed and also I’d like to thank you for your time. So letting me know would be pretty sexy yknow??

So im using a throwaway because I really wanted to chat with yaal! So about a week ago I decided to try DXM after about a year of considering it and researching it.

TLDR: DXM Is pretty strange, fun, and I think we need to be a bit safer about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I'm 22 M, roughly 155 LBS, and have done Acid, Mushrooms, X, weed, with my fav being Acid.

Trip Planning:

It was about 9 PM, and I decided 150MG was a safe dose in case I had the enzyme deficiency. This brings us to point number 1 about DXM Safety:

1. There is an enzyme deficiency that affects roughly 1 - 2% of the population, in which it makes DXM roughly 3x as strong. Do your own research about it since I don't know too many specifics off the top of my head, but it's a big thing to know!

As I mentioned before, I have been researching DXM for over a year before trying it, and I didn't know about this fact until my final research day like a week before my trip! This is pretty important news for noobies and safety! I think we need to be better about spreading this info and I haven't seen many people talk about it when noobs are asking for DXM trip advice.

150 MG seemed like a good call for my body weight, as without the deficiency it was scheduled to put me in high first low second plat, and with the deficiency a mid third, which would have been rough but survivable.

The Trip:

My plan was to just go big chill mode, play some Left 4 Dead 2, draw, and listen to music. I like to trip on new substances solo for the first time with a close friend as backup to call if necessary. I personally find this easier, but everyones different! Roughly 30 minutes in, I was starting to feel it. It felt like 5-10 minutes had passed, and It was already 45. The time dilation ended up being crazy throughout the trip, With minutes feeling like hours and vice versa! By this time (45 - 1 hour in), I began to experience light nausia, but it was workable. This brings me to point number 2 about DXM Safety.

2. The negative side effects are very apparent with DXM, and I think we need to acknowledge them more, especially with the high doses.

Like I said, I am 155 pounds, did roughly 150 MG, and even still the nausia, and ""dirty"" ""sludgy"" feeling was quite apparent. I can't even imagine what these effects would be like at the 300 - 500 - 700 MG level I frequently see people talking about. Leading us to Point 2A about safety.

2A. While tolerance goes up with Body weight, I can't imagine negative effects go down

I know im pretty light, and In my opinion thats pretty significant in DXM safety. For people who need 200 - 300 MG to get to the same level I was, Remember it is going to have MORE effect on your body in the negative ways, even if you're tripping at the same level.

The Trip Cont:

After about an hour and a half, I was feeling a little spacy and having fun! At this point, the night took a crazy turn like trips often do in that my homie hit me up to make art and chill. Usually I'd make up some excuse if I am already inebriated, as I can get a bit self conscious about that, but it was relatively low key so I figured why not! Come on over! She rolls thru with a few fatty beers, and we spend the next hour chilling, drawing, and drinking.

I know people recommend not drinking on DXM, where I was at it felt relatively safe and in control, but I'm not sure if id recommend it one way or another, more insight here would be great! 

EDIT: apparently this is considered a dangerous combo, Mb fam would not recommend and will not do again!

Its now about midnight, and my other homie decides to roll through as well! The energy was insane. We were just drawing crazy collabs, drinking, laughing, catching up, we all agreed it was a hugely inspiring night creatively.

Next moment, the first homie (Lets call her W) says ""wanna smoke some kush?"" and again, usually id deny going so hard but it just felt right to go full psycho. Usually I'm a mad lightweight, so I was smart and took one half bong rip and it was ALMOST a breaking point.

I went inside to grab some water, and for like 30 - 60 seconds I was thinking ""Holy shit I am so high and paranoid, I gotta tell my homies that they need to leave so I can lay down."" Then all of a sudden, another part of my brain kicked in and was all ""nah you're chilling just roll with the trip"" So thats what I did!

The great water incident:

So some backstory here: My father used to be an alcoholic so he has hella water alternatives stocked up in his home. Fruity water, fuckin' tonic water, bubbly water etc etc etc. The big problem, is he has NO NORMAL WATER IN HIS HOUSE! Growing up this would seriously fuck me up as I'd wake up so fucking thirsty and theres no water to quench this great thrist in my home. Cali sink water is so nasty I can't do it. So anyways, I run inside to grab me and the crew water, and this predicament occurs. No water in sight, only bubbly water.

I finally find some nice ass, crisp, filtered water. Iodized, liquid gold. But now another problem, theres no containers to hold water (my high ass thought three cups would be too difficult to carry). So in a stroke of DXM high brain, I drain 2 fucking liters of perrier and fill it with this filtered water.

I run back outside to my homies holding two huge perrier bottles, and they are all ""Bro WYA you've been gone like 15 minutes"" And as I fill them in on what happened we can't stop dying. We mob back to my room, and keep drawing until like 4AM with mad vibes and inspiration, also hella hydrated.

Comedown:

After my crew rolls out around 4, I'm stuck in bed and still tripping relatively hard. Music sounds mad sick, and at this point I realized how weird the night was and the mild blur it was. Its like I kept being placed in hella weird situations, yet they were logical how I ended up there. Thats when I realized how much of a trip DXM really is. CEV were stong, but muted. Not terribly bright or sharp.

During the comedown, my brain felt like it had two sides. One side was fast, zipping around, capable of brainstorming and creative thought. The other side was sludgy, slow, slimy, and felt kinda dirty. Both sides came up with ideas simultaneously, feeding off one another, but the slow side definitely had a bit of a negative feeling.

Probably the craziest think that happened the entire trip was at some point in the middle of the night: It felt like I was simultaneously getting out of bed to walk to the bathrooom, standing at the toilet doing my bizz, and falling back into bed. It is so difficult to describe but it honestly felt like I was living in multiple times at once, experiencing all three simultaneously, on repeat. IF ANYONE ELSE CAN COMMENT ON THIS PART THAT'D BE GREAT BECAUSE IT WAS FUCKING WEIRD!

This comedown was pretty easy, but again, the negatives of DXM were quite apparent at this point. I continued to think about was how strong DXM is as a substance, and the obvious negatives that come with it, along with the fun! Leading us to point 3.

3. I think the ""One week per plateau"" rule is ultimately dangerous and we should begin advocating for more space in between DXM Trips.

Like I keep repeating, stuff is strong, and I only did 150 MG! I see yaal talking about doses 2 - 4 times as large as this, with only 2 - 4 week gaps!

I'm definitely interested in doing it again, but I think a much longer gap is necessary with this one. You can feel it cooking you a lil' bit, and I had probably 2 days post trip of mild visuals when looking at patterns (rock formations). Afterglow was hella enjoyable, and I never felt terribly down or depressed, but I did feel a touch slower or spacey.

I'm curious to hear what yaal think about this, your experiences with RoboTripping. Does this seem like a high first low second trip? Have fun and stay safe yaal, Take care &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

BONUS:

Notes in my phone from the trip:

Tuesday, 6-16-20, 7:45PM: DXM 150mg notes:

30 minutes in: holy crap I thought it’s been like 12 minutes time is getting tougher to comprehend.

40 min: Light nausea but it’s workable. 

Trip report: overall, didn’t recognize the effects much until now. closed eye visuals relatively strong with muted colors.

Not my favorite comedown, feels a bit dirty and gross body weight. Some nausea coming back, even though it was gone post comeup.

Next morning: that was a weird one. Lasted way longer than i thought, falling asleep around 4:30 with numerous wake up. Towards the end, time felt strange, like I was going backwards and forwards at the same time. There was one point where It really felt like I was both getting out of bed to go to the bathroom and standing at the toilet peeing already. 

It was also like my brain had been split in two, with one slower side, and one faster side, both working on each other to form ideas. 

Overall, I think it was interesting but I don’t know if I want to continue going further without large breaks in between. The Nausia at this dose was noticeable enough to not want more, and the comedown felt pretty dirty.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,689700,public,confidence,self,Lets Talk: DXM,0,[],0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hh38y3/lets_talk_dxm/,,no_ads,0.0,1593326625.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1593303193.0,,

I know, irresponsible usage of my Wellbutrin. I really need to get on some ADD meds so I’ll be looking into that shortly.

Now, I have interest in many drugs (if not all), but the main things I have googly heart eyes for are DMT and ecstacy. I am a cannabis user and honestly haven’t thought twice about that much. I’m not a frequent cannabis user, but I am a binge cannabis user most of the time when I DO smoke. If I were to use ecstacy “again” (first “time” I got it dodgily so who’s to say what it really was, it could have just been a glorified yopper with a little extra “pizazz” added in it, or even just a yopper. I took only half a pill which I split with my ex-bf and didn’t get the effects I expected from ecstacy, such as crazy horniness. THOUGH, and this is going to sound contradictory- I DID cum from him touching my knee 😂😂😂 which i know to be an ecstacy effect, but other than that short couple of minutes I was just at my regular level of horniness, less actually, way less. It was still THERE a lot because it was at a time I was way hornier in general and I was only seeing my bf once in a great blue moon with months in between. But it was SIGNIFICANTLY less than usual for back then, which I thought and still think is SOOOO PECULIAR for someone on ecstacy. Should have made this its own thread and not the longest fuckin parenthesis ever but yeah does anybody know what this drug may have been? It was like 3 and a half years ago I took it) anyways I’d i were to take ecstacy “again”, OR if I took “real ecstacy” for the first time [if that pill I took WASN’T x), would I have to worry about it combing with my wellbutrin? What about if I try DMT for the first time? And what about ecstacy (or my glorified yopper or whatever the fuck it was I took before, because I’m not sure if that’s all I’ll be able to get my hands on just cause I don’t have much of a social circle) and DMT together?

My main concern is the meth and benzos, meth went from occasional to literally all the time until I sobered up on Christmas Day and in meth and etiz withdrawals (I had the drugs on me but I was just like, finished with being stupid with my usage, I was really lonely and depressed over a girl at the time so I just channeled that into my usage hard) decided to sober up for a bit

That was about 3 days of not sleeping, hallucinations, literally no strength to move or motivation, being an asshole, etc - I have no idea how I didn’t just die cutting myself off of etiz lmao I don’t even know how high I dose now but it had to be like 16mg or something then to sleep at nights and I just cold turkeyed it

A few days after Christmas I basically “needed” to start taking meth again just to do my responsibilities at the time, it honestly wasn’t even an addiction thing it was more like “ugh I have to take this so I can actually do my job without passing out” and with etiz / lyrica it just became that I couldn’t be out in public with current gf / friends / whoever without being “tweaky”, once again kind of a “necessity” thing, I almost hated my usage at this point 

Since then I kind of just went off the deep end, I’ve been smoking meth daily for like 5 months straight, using etiz or lyrica almost daily (breaks for lyrica tolerance), I’m just wondering like realistically how much damage have I done to myself? Is my brain just fucked now? I can’t see myself getting too much better, I want to get my etiz usage down to a normal level but at this point I think it’s basically necessary for me to function, im just concerned about the meth because I know it’s neurotoxic and I know binging it is the worst way to use it

I’m honestly pretty happy right now but I am aware my usage has gotten kind of stupid so I just need some advice

So I guess I’m asking
- How much damage have I done to myself? What specifically have I likely done to my brain / body? What’s the best strategy to undo whatever damage can be undone?

- What’s the best strategy to still use meth but control your usage enough to prevent significant damage?

I was diagnosed about a year ago, and in that first year I've had 13 grand mals. I was doing drugs occasionaly(weed, amphetamine, GHB, ecstasy, ketamine), but only 3 seizures happened ""directly"" after getting high. There were few times when I went all the way- (mixing 4 different drugs, no sleep for two days) - and, surprisingly, didn't have a seizure. Most of them happened in completely average circumstances.

Since I have new medication, I'm seizure free half year already. In that time I've been doing amphetamines once a week(bit less often), and also went out and mixed different drugs etc., but no seizure.

So I guess it was just that I didn't have right meds before. Also, Im talking grand mals, because Im never sure about little ones.

Its weird because I most often do amphetamines, and uppers are bad for epilepsy. At the moment, I feel like I can just do drugs with ""no consequences"".

I seem to have some form of OCD, possibly PURE-O because I have repetitive thoughts and rumination and unwanted thoughts. When I have smoked the thoughts have become deeper. It’s like I’ll be thinking about a past interaction with someone and instead of just thinking about what they said or did, I’ll think so much deeper and try to work out what their thought process was and why they did those things. I used to put weed on a pedestal because it allowed me to see things from a different perspective when I was depressed but now it just puts me into a panic and the thoughts are overwhelming. Maybe in the past I’ve just smoked through these thoughts or Because I’ve been smoking everyday I’ve built up an amount of thc in my system.. I don’t know tbh. 

Really what I want to know is what drugs would be better for me in this situation? I’ve been considering ordering alorazolam (Xanax). I’ve never used any downers before. But if it stops the horrible thoughts and allow me just to go to sleep or even cope with having a normal life ill be up for it.

Some shit happened. I usually dont care to share my shit with random people on the internet that i dont care about but i guess imma write stuff down real quick. 

So basically i got some acid(turned out to be nbome or some shit idk what it was) from a buddy, we hung out abit inside but i got bored and he started to stream on twitch so i left. Got on my bike and I kinda wanted to go home but I love nature and I jogg through the forest alot so I went there. I was also abit high on weed. 

So it was all chill. I also have a special place that is kinda deep inside the forest, nobody knew about it. It was on a little hill covered by trees. But lately i unfortunately noticed that somebody found the place. And they have been littering plastic and chopping down trees to make a fire  to grill stuff. Everything was kinda dirty. Kinda upsetting but I didnt mind. I felt nice

So.. I start to hear noises from the leaves from below and those noises came closer and closer. I started to look around I figured it must be a human and I saw some guy in a red shirt or jacket or something. I thought ok he might be randomly passing by but nonono he knew about this place. And guess what he started to play on his phoone.. yes LIL PEEP MUSIC. I was smiling so hard bc I couldn't believe it. What are the chances to meet a random lil peep fan especially in germany where there aren't that many people who even know lil peep. 

So the music came closer and he went up the hill where I was. I thought, dam, I'm gonna love him no matter who he is. He came up to me from behind and asked me if I've seen his Id that he lost somewhere. I was weirded out just like him but I dont rly get panik anymore I rather get excited. He on the other hand was kinda shaky and intimidated. It was so weird but it was cool. It was some 17 year old or something, mind that I'm 25. We exchanged some words I told him that I love lol peep blabla. I also asked if they fucked this place up and he said no and got abit more nervous so I knew exactly that he lied and I wish I couldve beaten him up over it but I let him go. I also noticed that his eyes looked completely black bc they were brown but I was tripping abit so they looked black to me. Soo.. he wanted to go again we said goodbye and he didnt even really searched for his I'd anymore.  Weird weird weird.

So now I'm kinda getting paranoid thoughts bc.. Wtf are the chances man. I kinda embraced my paranoia bc it was kinda fun to think about. Add to that, I pissed off alot of people lately.. of all sorts. A doctor, police, my schizophrenic weed plug threatened me with a homicide, a psychologist, some of my ""friends"" and other people. Bc I was being real with everybody. I didnt want to stay quiet and look at the bullshit they all been creating for forever. I kid you not I'm really surrounded by idiots, pedophiles, junkies, spoiled rich kids with bad character blablabla. So i started to think this guy is some stupid little ugly demon that cursed this forest. Or hes from the FBI.  I just thought somebody wanted to find me to recruit me on their side or to kill me bc I know abit too much about the truth of this ugly society that we live in. Add to that, it was the first time that I've had my phone with me. I always go into the forest with just my keys for the apartment. Did they track me down? Bc it's been my special place for a long time and I haven't seen a soul coming near that thing. His dark eyes, his evil spirit. Him not minding to search more for his Id was all so weird. So anyway

It got darker to the point where I could barely see the sky between the dark trees. I went home and started to call everybody I know at midnight bc I was bored. They were kinda annoyed but I had some shit to tell them about, like always. They were amused. And then I went to sleep and yeahh.. it was something different buut fun.

Tltr: Took unknown blotter, went into the forest to my special place that nobody knew of, random guy appears while playing lil peep music on his phone, I got paranoid bc he had completely black eyes and he seemed evil.

Tbh I'm ashamed to know that people like him listen to lil peep. I hope I'm not right with my accusations.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,689661,public,confidence,self,Met a demon in the forest,0,[],0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hgz1fg/met_a_demon_in_the_forest/,,no_ads,0.0,1593312455.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But now a days I get super paranoid and anxiety if I get high which is super weird as Ive never felt like this before and as a person I am pretty brave and I am not scared of anything etc..

Every time I smoke weed I start thinking myself what if I get heart attack and really paranoid of it. I end up putting my hand on my chest and constantly think about it until my high gets off, I have even started being little paranoid of heart attack when I am fully sober.

&lt;&lt; Ive had pretty fast food based diet as I dont have time to cook myself because of work &lt;&lt;&lt; this is one of the reasons why I start thinking of heart attack as lifestyle hasnt been so healthy

Being high doesnt seem fun anymore and I had to quit because of this. What should I do? How do I get rid off this?

Ive also used other drugs in nightclubs on weekends randomly, for example mdma and cocaine &lt;&lt; its the same for them as well, not as strong anxiety as from weed but little bit.

I invited some friends over to grill. My friend eats 2, and stares at his vape for 2hrs without saying a word and smiling so hard it made me wanna giggle. He laughed at everything I said, he had a blast. I dropped 4 300ug tabs at the same time and smoked a dab that was coated in MDMA crystals (yes MDMA is smokable off a dab rig at low temp and it tastes like sweet sugary fumes) to ease any come up anxiety. I had HORRIFIC ADHD and not even actually Methamphetamine can get me high, it just makes me super slow and feel dank asf. MDMA is very similar but when I smoke it it’s like an “electrical blast off” in my vision if that makes sense. Fast forward to after I’m done peaking. I suddenly fall asleep, I know I shouldn’t be able to sleep because I’ve ingested 1200ug of LSD and 5 points of MDMA both smoked and eaten. I wake up to green static spots everywhere and intense thought loops followed by the intense desire to close my eyes and slip back into sleep. I knew something was wrong but didn’t know what. Must have been a couple hrs at this point. I fall asleep again, I almost took a benzo too which I would have 100% died if I did. I wake up seeing nothing but static green and my brain is grilling so hard on low blood sugar I can’t even tell I’m frying anymore all I know is I need sugar and I’m to low to stand up or even feed myself or even TALK. I get my friend to drag me to the kitchen, I’m screaming noises and pointing to my mouth, my lips are purple at this point and my blood sugar is so low my eyes are rolling around and closing. All I can think about is how I’m gonna like literally ACTUALLY die while frying my shit harder than I ever have. My friend managed to cram 4 bottles of juice and a cup of milk down my throat and I lay down and fall asleep again. He took my sugars while I’m passed out and said it only said LOW meaning I was under 30, I can’t feel my lows at all even when down to the 20’s so this horrified me. I can’t believe I’m alive, I was low for more than half the trip. Out of a 12hr trip I literally slept through 4-5hrs of it while actually dying. So my fellow diabetics.., make sure to check your sugars consistently, or have a CGM. Especially if you also suffer from Hypoglycemia unawares as I do. I’ll say this now, my mind did some crazy shit when that low. It was more like I was delusional while extremely manic rather than horrified. I didn’t feel fear until I realized it wasn’t drugs making me feel like I was dying and it was my actual body. Can’t tell if I use drugs to much or if I’m actually that depressed lol. Guess it’s not normal to not be worried when your sugars are ungodly high or god awful low.. I’ll get some help soon.

Is there a way to use it but not get addicted and feel no downs?

Now I have a couple of 40 mg, instant release Ritalin pills. I'm planning on using them in the future for stressed and busy times, with large papers.

My younger sister has a history with drug addiction and is obviously on something now but we're having a hard time figuring out what exactly, would appreciate any insight!

In the past she has abused cocaine, alcohol, and a few years ago it was heroin-- she was put on suboxone (or whatever the long-lasting injection form of suboxone is) and has been on it for about two years now, though she has been slowly weaning off of it.

Her drug use behaviors have continued though-- she spends hours in the bathroom where we have found/heard blow torches and there's often a strong chemical smell as well.

We've found ""crack"" pipes (I don't really know my pipes, but these are DEFINITELY not used for weed) in her room and recently found a purse full of sudafed with a note saying ""to help with sweating"" along with two small measuring spoons with a white crystalline substance on them. 

She talks super fast and aggressively and gets suuuuuuper defensive any time any comment is made about her strange behavior. She spends the entire day in the bathroom or in her bed. She also has loads of spray paint cans and other strange ""crafting"" supplies in her room but no crafts are actually being made.

My gut says it must either be crack or meth however my mom is adamant it can't be one of those because in the last few weeks she has gained a substantial amount of weight (not normal weight, in my opinion, she looks swollen and puffy) and the primary symptom for both is extreme weight loss.

Can someone help me figure out what she could be using?

A really big accident, a person died.

All the media are talking about is that the driver was under the influence of amphetamine. Calling him a druggie. Lots of blame being put on him. 

And my first thought was, how could amphetamine cause this ? 

So i listened until i heard the defender: 

„The driver was feeling very bad this day and called in sick but got refused and he had to come despite his bad condition. He took amphetamine to try to function better during the shift despite his bad condition”

So a man, who maybe did something he shouldnt have, maybe he binged, maybe he partied, maybe he was legitimately ill was responsible enough to ask to not go to work that day. Because he knew he will not be able to function. He took a substance that could only make him be more able and aware then if he didnt. 

But all the media talk about is that 

- The man had 0.54g of amphetamine hidden in the bus

- The man admitted he ingested drugs before his shift.

They even skip the fact it was amphetamine, they’ll say drugs, „a drugged driver” „driver on drugs”

From information gathered the man is not a saint, but whats going on right now is fucking disgusting nevertheless. 

The man was FORCED to come to work, a person DIED in the crash, he’ll be feeling extreme guilt for probably as long as he’s alive and will face 12 to 15 years in prison. AFAIK the person who decided he must come to work that day either isnt talked about by the media or just isnt found guilty of anything wrong. Cause drugs are bad kids and they make you crash buses.

Fkn hell, sorry for the long post but seeing that shit everywhere on the news just makes my blood boil, all the hateful comments saying he deserves to just die etc.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,689573,public,confidence,self,Ridiculous drama in Polish media right now regarding an accident.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hgw00g/ridiculous_drama_in_polish_media_right_now/,,no_ads,0.0,1593302242.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Admittedly, I did have just one 20mg (IR) pill about one week into the break, but it actually worked a lot better than usual. I don't normally get any therapeutic (or recreational) use out of just 20mg; I use Adderall to treat ADD and some deficits from a TBI, which generally requires a fairly higher dose to get the therapeutic benefits. So it was pretty impressive that 20mg had been so effective.

Two weeks after that, I went back to my normal dosage. Took 40mg (I'm Rx'd 40mg-60mg) and got nothing but a bunch of immediate adverse effects, like I was crashing right away. I tried it again over the next couple days, trying another 40mg one day and 60mg the next. Still got the same result.

I can't figure out the problem. Based on my previous tolerance and regular dependency breaks, these doses should've been effective enough, so unless my whacky, *occasionally* unpredictable body chemistry is just inexplicably throwing a fit, I can't see why this is happening. 

The only other possible factor here is that I've been having some throat problems (rawness, minor swelling, even some small abscesses) which look like either cobblestone throat or *maybe* strep, though it doesn't fit all the symptoms for strep. Could that be affecting the Adderall's efficacy? I don't have a fever or any other cold/flue symptoms, it's strictly related to my throat itself, but maybe some bacterial infection or a viral infection from strep could be taxing my body, thereby making it too weak to tolerate the Adderall? Is that possible?

I think I'm doing everything else right. Eating healthy, hydrating, sleeping, taking vitamins, etc. But maybe I'm missing something, 'cause idgi.

While I was there I took the opportunity to try a weed vape pen because I missed my chance last time we were together. This was my first time ever trying drugs or weed. It was a Solei unplug cartridge thing in a vape. At first I didn't feel anything and I thought I wasn't doing it right  I was inhaling and trying to suck it into my lungs then release it after a second. I never smoked anything before so had no idea what I was doing but after trying it maybe 5 times I just started to feel tingly, dizzy, and slow but that was it. She kinda changed and was acting differently than usual so it must have been working for her. She got really tired after and had to go to sleep.

I was a little disappointed because I thought it was supposed to make you feel calm and mellow and hungry lol. I felt normal.. just slower... And tingling.

I wanted to try it to see if it would help me calming down and going to sleep at night. Trying to shut my brain off for a bit but that wasn't the case.

When I got home she suggested I buy my own just to try it again just before bed instead. She sent me the links to where and what I tried. 

I was going to buy the same but I found a place down the street from me that sells something similar from the same brand and showed it to her. It was Solei balance. She said that might be better for me because it has 50/50 thx and cbd. She thought that would be better because of the higher amount of cbd for anxiety and depression.

Well I bought it last week and tried it for the first time last night but I was even more disappointed. I didn't feel anything at all this time. I feel like I used a lot more to. Maybe 20 puffs over some hours while playing a game with friends online (I was doing a Bob Ross painting with her and her GF the first time) but I literally felt nothing. No tingling. No dizziness. No slowness. It didn't make me any calmer or relaxed and mellow at all. I just felt exactly the same but with a weird weed taste in my mouth.

Am I not smoking it right? Am I doing something wrong? I feel like I don't know how to smoke or vape right. This is not what I was expecting weed to be like at all.

Sadly, that often costs someone their life. Before we even get started, first of all, I would advise you not to do drugs, but as we all know, this wont help at all so I'm here to offer real advice on how to use safely. First I'll be saying some basic safety stuff.

\- Do not drive under influence, please. It could cost someone elses life as well as YOURS! On top of that, if someone dies and you survive, you'll live your life facing charges knowing you killed someone because of some stupid decision.

\- You can always up your dosage, but you can never undo drug, so take little and let it take effect and see how you feel and decide if you should take more, this doesn't always apply to benzos though as they make delusions of sobriety, better safe than sorry.

\- Test kits. BUY those, nowadays you don't know at all what you are getting, there's no point in putting yourself in danger because you couldn't spend little money to test your drug. Not always even they help though so be careful, there's a thing called ""hotspots"", which basically means that one spot has more than other one, and it could be other substance but yeah, not that likely in my opinion.

\- Scales. If you want to take drugs that will be in powder form or whatever. Or even know did you get scammed, have a scale. Eyeballing your dose WON'T work but instead, you either take too little or too much, this can be dangerous as it could end in overdose.

\- Moderation is a key, don't binge or just mindlessly do drugs, that will end up bad. Set limits. 

\- Have narcan, even if you don't touch opioids yourself, but it could come in handy and potentially save others.

\- Take care of yourself, mentally and physically, that will result in better life and experiences with drugs, better highs.

\- Think twice before doing a drug and do TONS of research on it and don't believe everything you read, I'll leave some reliable sources at the end of this post.

\- Don't start using drugs as means to deal with your mental health, they will make it all worse and leave you with more problems.

\- Respect drugs.

\- Remember our brains develop until the age of 25 and remember you CAN get addicted to anything.

\- Also, to say. You can safely order from Darknet. There's many great guides to it and FBI or whatever won't waste resources, their time and money on someone that spent little money to get fucked up.

\- Before going to the drugs, I'll mainly talk about classical ones. I'll say this, if you haven't injected, do NOT even start. Injection itself is an addiction and strong one at that. I honestly don't know what advice to give about this one but if you DO inject, do it in a safe place, and dispose of the used needles properly, please. 

I might have forgotten something but I'm sure this community will help in the comments. In the end of this post you will find some reliable sources for drugs, and including drug combo chart. Oh, and I'll speak mainly on classical ones and their classes, I won't write too much about them because you can do your research too and I might've forgotten a lot but anyways, let's get to it.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Cannabis (Weed): This drug is ok, but it's not harmless or as harmless people make it to be, it will lose it's magic over time, and it has withdrawals too, but also long term use, especially on developing brain contains such as anxiety, slow functioning and more, it will effect your brain and such but it's definitely not dangerous either. Getting off it when you want, if you have already been on it for quite a time, will suck ass but you'll get through it. People don't ABUSE this or any other drug, treat them with respect and remember caution. Weed also has psychedelic properties to it, which is why there are some who class it as psychedelic while others don't but yeah. This is probably most abused drug, right after alcohol. If you have no tolerance or such, start low, I'd say, try 0.5g. Also, the smell and taste will stick and be way stronger than say, cigarettes. 

\- Alcohol: In my personal opinion this drug sucks ass, but it's also highly addictive, the addiction sucks just like with any other drug but you can also die of alcohol withdrawals. Don't start drinking to runaway, it simply, just. won't. work. It will worsen them, like any other drug, they come back next day even worse, or if you are like me, you can't even drink them away but instead face them head on. But a fun drug to take in parties, when people talk of ""hard drugs"", well, I have many opinions on that, but if I talk to much larger group, they get it better if I just say ""hard drugs"" so anyways, alcohol, is one of them. Long term use causes a lot of problems, mentally and physically. Don't abuse this one. I'd like to point out, alcohol destroy lives, families and cost lives.

Benzos such as xanax (alprazolam), valium (diazepam), klonopin (clonazepam): Oh gosh, I'd rather keep this short.. they are great for anxiety relief and such, but abusing them will be bad in the long run. Xanax lasts for few hours and without tolerance take 1mg, and don't drive, don't mix them with alcohol for various reasons, you don't want to blackout and do something dumb shit, get charged, kill somebody or whatever, or you don't want to overdose yourself either. With benzos there is cross tolerance and benzos will basically fuck up your life if you aren't responsible with your use, there are many bad things in long term use, benzo withdrawal is hell and can be fatal. Valium lasts for few hours also, 10mg equals to 1mg xanax or 1mg klonopin.  So, you are good with 10mg. Klonopin, good with 1mg and yeah now I come to this, xanax and kpins are basically 1:1 in potency, but blackout potential of xanax is higher.  And you do not want to blackout and possibly end up in r/BartardStories. Klonopin lasts up to 12 hours.  I'd like to point out, benzos destroy lives, families and in some cases cost lives. But generally benzos are basically impossible to overdose on them alone.

\- Next let's get to psychedelics. First of all, I'll say a bit about LSD: LSD is strong, common starter dose is around 100-150 ug which is one tab of acid. People also sell stuff labeled as LSD so first of all, LSD doesn't taste like anything and it doesn't smell. So, if you want to do it, put it on your tongue for like 10-15 minutes, does it taste? (Assuming you already smelled if it had a smell), and does your tongue start getting little weird feeling to it? If it's just like I've described, you can either let it be on tongue or just straight up swallow it (swallowing it, is better imo, but if it's not LSD it can be dangerous, but at this point it should be LSD). Also, do NOT smoke weed with psychedelics, they potentiate each other and make it a lot more intense. LSD lasts around 12 hours, the come up is rough so be prepared. Also, how to safely trip, you could have a trip sitter (someone sober but in a way experienced that she/he knows how to help when it gets bad), be in safe space, remove mirrors, dangerous items and such, have good and positive mindset, if you don't feel like tripping, then DON'T. Surround yourself with only people you trust and aren't that negative, you could also have trip killers just in case. Benzos and anti-psychotics, first of all, benzos just make it less intense and take the edge off it, take the anxiety and other negative things away that usually are part of bad trips and such, anti-psychotics should kill the trip etc totally. LSD isn't harmless either. Yeah, as a drug maybe but it is one really powerful drug, and there's no telling what you'll go through, it's either good or bad. Also, if you have experienced psychotic symptoms, are vulnerable or have schizophrenia in your family, then step away. Also, little note: psychedelics and weed can even launch schizophrenia or psychotic stuff in those who don't have it running in family. Take minimum 2 weeks between doses, to not lose the magic, to not develop HPPD or anything else.

Shrooms: You can have them in many ways, often people just eat them, I'd say common dose is 2 grams. I explained a lot of psychedelics above already so this won't be as long. But anyways, Shrooms can last up to 6 hours, there's discussions between which is stronger Shrooms or LSD, but I'd say LSD, but many circumstances could make Shrooms stronger, but rather start with Shrooms than LSD. Set and setting is the key here also. Also, I'd like to point out that these are most likely the most common psychedelics and I know about them more than the others so others won't be listed but yeah, do your research EVERYTIME before you take a drug, and I mean lots of research. Shrooms could help you with your mental health problems but at the same time they could potentially make it worse, be careful. Remember to be in the right mindset when you do psychedelics. Let's get going.

\- Stimulants such as Methamphetamine (Meth/Speed in the us), MDMA (Mandy, Molly, XTC, X, ecstasy and others), Amphetamine (Speed in EU), Cocaine.

Let's start with meth, yeah I don't have much to say about that, I don't know that much of it that I could be giving you advice, other than these, first of all, stay away.. it's highly addictive and destructive, and you can find A LOT about it just by searching it inside this subreddit. I'd like to point out, meth destroy lives, families and cost lives.

Amphetamine: Yeah, addictive, personally I like it kinda. Purity varies a lot, and I can't really tell the common dose on this one as the purity varies so much and I get really bad amphetamine here. It's also cut often so test your stuff. Be careful and do your research. Lasts few hours.

Cocaine: It has a lot greatness to it and is quite popular. Common dose I'd say is 45+mg, all depending on the quality of course. It can last from 10 to 90 minutes about, also it's cut often like a lot of drugs nowadays. Test it with test kit, and you can taste it little, cocaine numbs your mouth. It's bad for your heart and some mix it with alcohol, which makes it more intense but is a lot worse for your heart as a price. Bad coke won't last long. It is highly addictive. Do your research.

MDMA: First of all, I can probably give the most harm reduction on this one. First of all there's rule to this, use it ONCE every 2 or 3 months. It's neurotoxic and you need your brain to recover, comedown sucks. It dehydrates you a lot so also remember to drink, but don't drink too little or too much, usually it's advised to drink a glass of water per hour. Be careful with what you are getting and yeah, I just thought I'd point out that it tastes like absolutely shit lol. Test this one also, it could be anything. It can last up to 6 hours, common doses vary but for starter I'd say to take 100-130 mg, don't drink with it even though many do. Alcohol dehydrates you also and makes the risks greater to get some bad effects and more. There's more to it, but at the moment.. I can't remember everything to all this so, do your research on this also but be cautious.

Opioids such as Heroin,  Oxy (keeping it short 'cause there are different kinds of), Codeine: I'd tell you to... stay the fuck away from them honestly but we all know that it won't work so here it is. I'd let you to know that there are a lot of drugs, including common/popular opioids that I won't cover in this post for many reasons, 1. it takes long time 2. too long post 3. you can easily research it all up. I'd like to point out, opioids destroy lives, families and cost lives. Have narcan nearby at all times.

Codeine: Let's start with the weakest one. If you are doing lines, then 30-60mg should be fine. With lean it's more and this is where I'll also say this thing, PROMETHAZINE DOESN'T GET YOU HIGH. Prometh is there to help with the nausea, itchiness and other side effects, not to enhance high or anything. Codeine is fairly harmless, it doesn't even come close in strength to other opioids, but it is addictive. You can overdose but not that likely that you'll die or overdose. But be careful and do your research, also codeine doesn't last long.

Oxy: This is one strong painkiller, some say it is one step closer to heroin, it is strong and quite addictive. Without tolerance, I'd advise to you to take MAX 20mg, but take 10, if it doesn't work then 5, and if it doesn't then another 5 but do this carefully. Be careful, they are pressed a lot too so test your stuff. Do your research.

Heroin: Heroin is highly addictive opioid, I can't really tell the common doses here, the dosages are REALLY low but there are many different ways to take the drug, which often are intravenous. If you snort it, then about 25mg, do your research and be careful, it's cut often and it usually contains fentanyl too. Test it.

I’ve been in the hospital (in Canada) for 1 week now for a Crohn’s flare and have been prescribed 3mg dilaudid (hydromorphone) per 3 hours subcutaneous due to my high tolerance for pain meds.
 
At this time, the 3mg has no longer any effect and I doubt the doc will prescribe a higher dose.  I don’t want to steal a vial but I’ve heard of people usine à saline flush the nurses leave around and extract the remaining 0.4 ml of the drug in my subcutaneous patch/IV thing (see photos for reference) and saving those and injecting in my IV in my veins after.

Work was easy, I blew through the calls I needed to and things seemed pretty manageable until around 4pm, another issue popped up which needed immediate resolution.

I've had some terrible experiences ridden with anxiety when smoking, but since I began doing it more frequently over the last few months I've been getting much better at controlling the negative emotions whenever they arise. 

The source of my anxiety has always been a fear of having a psychosis or developing mental illness. I have a maternal aunt who's diagnosed with bipolar disorder and she has experienced hallucinations, mostly during times of mental crisis. As far as I know these hallucinations have mostly been auditory, such as hearing people talking in another room. I don't think she experiences delusions or have a voice inside her head speaking to her. She is the only immediate family member of mine to have been diagnosed with bipolar, or any other psychotic, disorder. She's currently medicated and lives a normal life with work and a family.

Once when I was 22 I had an extremely scary experience while very high on weed. I won't go into the details of it, but involves an encounter with a dealer who was really upset at my friend and, by association, upset at me as well. After that experience I experienced high paranoia for a couple of months, verging on delusions of being followed/watched etc. I have a hard time determining whether I was in fact experiencing a psychosis or if my reaction was understandable given the terrifying nature of what I went through. Things went back to normal after those months as I began accepting that I was not in any kind of trouble, and since then I haven't experienced any sort of delusions except for the occasional glitch and sound you can hear when really high, but I've read that those are normal (can anyone confirm that?). 

I want to try psychedelics for both spiritual and aesthetic reasons. I've been making a lot of research and I'm approaching my use of them with extreme caution. For my first time I thought I'd take 0.2 grams together with my girlfriend and go to a nearby park with beautiful nature. I know this is a very low dose but I've read that some people can be really sensitive to them and I'm,not in a hurry so I'd rather be careful. 

Given my genetic background and history with weed, do you think it's a bad idea for me to mess with psychedelics? Does the fact that I'm 28 and with a fully formed brain significantly decreases the odds of having a psychosis or worse, developing a permanent mental illness? Should I take 0.2g by myself first and have my gf as trip sitter or is it fine if we do it together from the first time? If you think my risk is high, is so high that I shouldn't even experiment with low doses? My goal is to start small and climb to 1-2g doses. 

I have no interest in abusing any drug so the chances of me doing something impulsive like taking a large dose or doing it too often are really low.

I started when I was 14 with 2 or 3 cigarettes occasionally and progressed to a pack a day by 17. I built my whole life around when I was getting cigarettes and if I had enough. It was my number one priority above all else to be able to smoke as much as I wanted everyday. That led to a other drugs when the nicotine buzz disappeared and it became just something I had to do. But I was in complete denial and still told myself I enjoy every second it was taking away from me in the future. I’ve done just about every drug put there and it’s become a obsession of mine to learn every fact about them. I’ve quit drugs that seemed impossible before (black tar and Xanax) with no need to come back to them but the 2 I can’t get over are Meth and DXM. I feel like I have to be on one or have a plan to be on one or the other to function and feel normal but both drugs are completely controlling me and making me act so different. I’ve become emotionless and inconsiderate and irrationally angry to the point where I completely lose my temper and scream at everyone around me over every little 1st world problem I’ve caused myself, and all 3 are extremely out of character for myself i overcame those flaws when I was 12 and thought I would never come back to them. I am now choosing meth or DXM over nicotine at times which is a huge deal for me. I’ve lost my almost all my friends and I continually lie and disappointment my best friends that stuck with me because of my addiction. I just can’t think of a reason to really convince myself it’s not worth it to do meth or DXM. I just say it isn’t and try to distract myself when deep down I know I’m going to do them as soon as I get the chance and I’m going to make that chance happen that day. I guess I’ve just been waiting to hit rock bottom but It’s a waste of my energy and I’ve become a sad, unmotivated, boring, unreliable person when I used to be so outgoing and genuinely happy and always there for my friends. I’ve gotten my license suspended, lost my car, lost my mental stability, lost all respect for myself and from everyone I know, I’m not as social as I used to be, it’s harder to connect with people like I used to and I just can’t focus on anything anymore, everything just reminds me of meth or DXM. I’m also really addicted to weed and have a really hard time letting that go but not nearly as hard as meth and DXM they’ve both become more important in my head than nicotine and I find myself sad with no cigarettes but on one with nothing to do and no one to talk to. My work ethic is gone, I’ve really failed at work and am beyond lucky to still have my job, which I haven’t moved very far up in despite having a past reputation of climbing up very fast ti manager and being one of the hardest and most reliable workers there. my parents are on they’re last straw with me, and idk how much longer I can upset my friends, one of my friends has recently recovered from a meth addiction and I still bring that shit around him and constantly remind him how good it is and it’s just not fair to him. I really need advice on how to stop and turn my life back around and recover while I still have a chance. Again I rationally see myself as a drug addict and tell myself I need to stop when I’m high and feeling great but as soon as I come down and hit That low point I’m back to only thinking about drugs and planning everything around getting them. I always try to spend my high on either coming up with ways to quit and put it past myself but I know deep down I never will.

I want to know how my last experience with weed and greening out relates to others, (and, if it's particularly obvious, if what i took seems laced with something else, not trying to break that identification rule though). i greened out for the first time and it was pretty dang hard as far as i've been informed, so much that i even vomited a few times (but that's probably bc the pizza). i trust my friend and her judgement and that she would only give me good stuff that wouldn't hurt me, so dont jump to conclusions too fast, i can only describe what happened so well :/ anyway here goes:
my friend and i were eating pizza and drinking canned coffee drinks (starbucks doubleshot things, pretty good) and i took a hit on her dab pen, and i got moderately buzzed. she directed me on how to take a bigger hit and i did, i inhaled it for 3 seconds, took a breath of air, held that all for 6 seconds and then exhaled it out. this was supposed to be a really strong cart too jsyk.
i started feeling really good for the next 10-25 minutes, a strong but really enjoyable high, seemed pretty normal for weed. after that second hit i started to feel a tingling sensation on the crown of my head like a skullcap, which was fine, but as time progressed my hearing started to be a little distorted; like acoustics of where i was in the room were exaggerated (and my vision was slightly fisheyed, though that increased later).
over time the physical sensation on my head started to spread up and over my forehead, but then into my face, which let me feel the shape of my eyeballs and my tongue, and by now it was really uncomfortable and i could tell it was the feeling of blood flowing. this is when i recognized i was greening out (as i said, this was my first time greening out).
the blood flow feeling was really intense in my head and upper body at first which was really stressful as i could feel my heart beating extremely fast and my windpipe shifting in my neck and pretty much every object inside of me like i was viewing a 3D rendering. but the feeling lessened in intensity as it continued to spread downward to the bottom of my torso and to my pelvis, still feeling all the organs inside. after this it becomes harder to explain :/
my brain started to try to process all of this. it was like consciousness flowed out of my brain into every nerve in my body, but my brain was still trying to be the one to process all of it, so now with the minds of every nerve it tried to make coherent sense of it all. sometimes it felt like a monotone 3d rendering of my body but the color was shifting through the rainbow and flashing. other times i felt all my blood vessels which felt like cartoon metal pipes bulging in bumpy shapes in the space between connecting segments.
my friend was helping me out through all this so far, she turned off the TV and helped me focus on breathing and sipping water. i was worried i was gonna suffer heart failure from how fast my heart was racing, and i felt like i needed an IV to keep my hydrated bc of how drinking water made me uncomfortably feel my whole esophagus down to my stomach. she got me a blanket and everything, and i ended up with my face pressed to her arm and me clutching her hand, trying to focus on breathing.
some people came inside the house for a few minutes, which really stressed me out bc i didn't know them and they were taking my friend's attention which made me feel neglected (not in a contrived jealous way but in like, you're dying and the medic is chatting someone up instead of helping you), and i started to sob a little bit by the time they left, which i can only assume was just a few minutes.
through all that, if i didn't change what i was experiencing every few moments i would start to feel really really bad and i sort of forget why. i think bc if i didn't keep distracting it, my body would be allowed to focus on feeling every inch of itself again, which was not something i wanted to do. here my friend asked me if my stomach was hurting at all which i think by power of suggestion triggered the vomiting. i said no at first but then asked for a bowl. i threw up in it once before i had to go to the bathroom, where i threw up twice more.
in the bathroom the situation started to feel less dire, i was able to relax a little bit more, but i was still having weird mental conceptualisations of everything i was feeling, which started to include these weird images/shapes that felt really familiar like from really early years of my life, now coaxed out from a deep corner of my mind. i had an oddly specific impression that they were all based on an application icon from an old mac computer (which makes sense bc i have memories of using the computer as a little kid) but idk which app it would be. the shapes also seemed to have marks in two opposite corners (top right and bottom left i think), which in shape reminded me of the black knots on the white bark of a birch or aspen tree. the shape/images felt really familiar and nostalgic but they weren't very recognizable. they soon started shifting into other shapes and colors, it originally being a rounded corner squarish shape, but now moving into rounded corner triangle and pentagon shapes and so forth. i also got the impression my brain was scrolling through concepts from my earliest years forward, starting with familiar but not too familiar shapes and colors and moving to more complex things, but as i recognized this a few times i realized that would be uncomfortable to process so i tried to run that idea to its finish so my brain wouldn't focus on it and stress me out. 
anyway. i started to calm down a bit and nearly fell asleep. after my friend recommended i didn't sleep directly on the toilet i went and climbed onto a beam bag with lots of blankets. my brain started playing music by now which was fun, and at one point it played funny music as if it was the punchline of a
meme video which made me laugh and tell my friend about it, which felt good. from this point on i felt mostly better, now just pleasantly high with it coming back on and off.
so it really sucked at the worst parts but there was pleasantly high parts before and after the green out. i believe from the time i took the first hit and the time i got out of the bathroom was about 50-70 minutes if i remember what my friend said, though i couldn't tell you at all how long it was based on my perception of time alone.

It’s like I’m able to keep my head just barely above water to continue to live through repeated pain, loss, and failure. It’s like I’m watching in real time my life fall apart and it feels like there’s nothing I can do about it and if I do try to do the things I need to do I just collapse and end up 10 steps behind where I started.

It’s even worse when it feels like I’ve exhausted all my options and there’s nothing left but to slowly rot. I try to uplift myself and validate myself for my accomplishments and positive character traits but its completely dwarfed by every other aspect of my life. I’m so fucking tired of this cycle. I’m tired of looking like a malnourished drug addict. I’m tired of juggling a growing list of different problems that seems to grow by the day. I’m tired of genuinely trying and failing by my own hand and knowing there’s NOTHING and NO ONE else at fault but me. I’m tired of carrying around this fucking baggage. I wish  I could become more disciplined and take advantage of the tool box of self betterment passed down to me by people that fucking figured it out, but I feel like I’m an invisible handicapped quadruple amputee in a world of able bodied people who expect me to run a god damn triathlon when I struggle to walk up a set of stairs. I’m tired of barely hanging on just to watch my own self destruction. I’m tired of seeing basic human functions that come naturally to others feel so foreign to me. I want to change but I feel like it would take a miracle to climb out of this hole I spent my whole life digging for myself.

I feel for you. I feel for you on a deep level because I was there. It genuinely breaks my heart and makes me sad to see someone who is suffering like I had to suffer because it reminded me of how much I never wanted to feel like that. All of a sudden, without warning my trip turned bad and I felt instant panic and hopelessness to an degree that is still hard to explain. I held a knife to my neck. After holding it there for a few seconds I said no, I am having a bad trip. I went to the kitchen and had a glass of water. To this day this instantly calms me out of anxious situations
 
Imagine being on the 20th story of the burning highrise. You're in your room, and as it slowly starts to get completely engulfed in flames with no potential escape from the inside. You begin to suffocate and feel the heat beginning to rise. You realize you only have two choices, jump out the window and take the quick way out, or stay in your room, let the flames engulf you, and burn alive to feel every single atom of pain and suffering. That is a bad trip. Ignore what anyone else tells you it is, this is what a bad trip really is.

It hit home for me because it felt like for a second that I knew how suicidal individuals felt. Its not that life beats you down so much to where it builds up to a breaking point, its that every day you are on fire and in excruciating pain. You see no alternative way to escape, because as far as you know, there is no escape. Because of this, you jump out the window of 'the burning highrise'. 

The question I asked myself after which truly scared me was, was that a bad trip at that point? Was I really having a bad trip? Or was I having a bad life? If 12 hours you feel like that, is that not indicative that it is bad life rather than bad trip in the grand scheme of things? You live for 80+ years for crying out loud. 

It took months after to get to a state where I could mentally hold myself together after that trip because its as if I had made a grand soul shattering realization. Before that I would get nasty flashbacks

My advice to anyone dealing with life after a bad trip: You'll be fine with tine. I went through what you went through 2 years ago and came out the other side better. Your mind is healing and sooner or later that metaphysical door will shut. Sometimes life is just absurd and we cannot explain certain things because we just don't know, and that is okay. Its your right in whatever way to pursue the absolute truth and learn about our history, life in general and the nature of reality to better your understanding of yourself and the world, and it seems like you're at the start of some type of jungian style enlightenment.

Try not to spend too much time up in the spiritual realm either or you will drive yourself crazy. We are humans that are designed to have egos, designed to feel certain things, designed to inhabit this mundane reality. we all have particular proclivities.

i know thats not a big dose but does that mean every 1g of weight, its off about 1.9mg?

everytime i tried to sleep, i JUMPED up out of bed, thinking i was going to die. when i went downstairs the two times i did, i hallucinated so bad and felt like i teleported, and everything around me was blue and so STRANGE. 

i also am on a lifestyle change and haven’t eaten junk food/chocolate/cakes etc. in about three months. i ended up eating five big cookies that are like 200 calories each and 26g carbs each and two cake bars. i feel so guilty and grim lol ffsssss. 

but genuinely, i felt so weird. i thought i was having a heart attack, then the next minute i thought i was seconds away from passing away. i had to sleep with my brother because if i was going to die, at least i wouldn’t be alone. 

everything went numb too, my body, my throat, my mouth, my lips. i felt like i was having a nosebleed too, but no blood was there. it was a WEIRD sensation. i just can’t even explain how i felt. it’s genuinely scared me so much. 

i finally passed out and woke up feeling normal. i feel so weird saying this, but i cant even believe i woke up. seriously!!! i was vowing to myself that if i did survive, then i’d live my life to the fullest and stop complaining about mundane things LOL.

4-bromo substituted phenethylamines, my favourite. After an initial ingestion of 19mg of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, I embarked in to the depths of erotica which have long been repressed in my sexually impoverished psyche. Noted below are transcripts of notes written during this experience, and some comments for clarification of what I intended to say.  


A middle-aged Indian man, with an endomorphic plumpness to him entered in my field of view, whilst moaning the words ""We want your seed"", erratically pointing towards my testes, implying that he was so hungry that he would eat my testicular ejaculate, all said in the least sexual and imploring tone imaginable. He was so desperate for food for himself and family that the last resort for food was my own semen. The words ""ve vant vour seeeeed"" raged in my auditory-perception cavities, with each 'w' in 'we' and 'want' being replaced with a voiced labiodental fricative 'v'. As time passed, all I could hear was the thick monotony of this man screaming 'seeeeeed', with an annoyingly high-pitched sonorant 'eeeeeeee'. A thousand pigs in unison with an Indian accent, or so it sounded. ""SEEEEEEEEED, VE VANT YOUR SEEEEEED."" (Disclaimer, I am Keralan myself, perhaps my heritage is psychologically ingrained in to my consciousness, doubt it.)  


Once this hallucination passed, I decided to wank to nothing but my own thoughts, but was so involved in the robotic rigour of shifting my left hand up and down over my phallus that I ripped my foreskin. I bled, which hurt, but phallic bleeding has a dual-purpose of lubrication, which eased the pain. Wanking on drugs is great, usually. Mephedrone masturbation is unrivalled. Seriously.  


Nothing else too exciting occurred, I pissed in to a bottle and threw the piss out my window as I wanted to spare the embarrassment of having to see my housemates to get to my bathroom whilst off my nut on 2C-B. I listened to Massive Attack's 'Blue Lines' about 7 times as it was the only album I could remotely tolerate in this state of psychedelic impregnation.

I feel incredibly, incredibly confused. I hate sex, the idea of it makes me cringe, I feel its almost paradoxical by its very nature. What purpose does it hold? I don't want kids, never will do. It doesn't feel that great neither. Unless I'm psychologically disabled, which I admit is a huge possibility, in fact its inevitable. Despite this, 2C-B offered a glimpse of the depths of human to human erotica in the form of a hungry Indian man wanting to ingest my semen. Perhaps its a subconscious reflection of that fact that food shortage is inevitable during this pandemic, and that one day I will have to rely on the nutrition of my *Spermatazoa.* Maybe I should start a new thread: 'How to become an autotroph - 10 new semen recipes for you and family to enjoy'.

I hit an equilibrium, a balance that felt clear. I got out. I got my shit together. I made something of myself. I found the drive to succeed in this rat race. I found the love of my life. I found a future to strive toward. I’ve accomplished so much since the days that I let my brain experience everything that i could throw at it.

I did a post like this in the LSD subreddit, about my first acid trip at school, and look, I know it was a stupid decision and I don’t condone any similar actions, but I’d like to describe the experience, as it is an interesting story. I’m 23 now and I know much better. So... As the story goes...

By the time I had heard of ketamine I had no idea what it did, how it effected people, but I had been taking acid regularly at this point and pushing it into the school. So I got around with all the druggy kids, and I had a lot of connections.

Word around the school was that this other popular druggy kid, we’ll call him “K” for the sake of anonymity, got ahold of ketamine and was pushing it around the school. Me, being the curious kid that I was, after first trying acid and weed decided that I was all in balls out to trying new substances. I wasn’t friends with K, but I knew a friend of mine who knew him, we’ll call him “R”.

I get into contact with R and he talks to K about scoring us both some ketamine. They’re liquid horse tranquilizers dropped onto stiff tabs, this isn’t no blotter sheets, it’s some kind of sturdy paper material, kinda like cardboard but it doesn’t dissolve easily in the mouth. They’re $5 bucks a pop. I told R I want two for $10.

He’s supposed to meet me up before my business class, first class of the day, outside of my classroom, which is where I usually chill in the morning with my now ex-girlfriend.

So Im hanging out with my girlfriend at the time outside of the classroom, R says he’s on the way with the tabs. Minutes before the bell rings, I look over and see R stumbling through the corner turn into the hallway where I’m at. He looks high as fuck, walking like he’s drunk, eyes 99% shut, gripping a skateboard with one hand and the tabs in the other. He starts laughing and giggling as we do a quick exchange. 

Enjoying his tie dye shirt as he walks away with the money in his hands and the tabs in mine, I say goodbye to my ex-girlfriend and walk into business class. 

Now my business teacher is cool as shit, all junior year we had a good connection. She’s this older lady maybe mid 50s, she feels comfortable with me as one of the “druggy kids” and knows that I don’t snitch, so she’s given me lighters, cigarettes, shown me pictures of good weed she scored etc. So basically, she’s a cool ass teacher but I still had to hide it from her cause she doesn’t like it when people take advantage of her kindness.

Most days in her class are chill, since it’s a business class it’s basically a computer lab, a bunch of computers lining the walls with her desk in the front of the room. I have a friend in this class, we will call him “A”. I sit next to A, and tell him what I got. He does acid and the whole lot so he thinks it interesting how it will be to see me on ketamine. 

Class starts and the whole class we’re just supposed to do some kind of research on various businesses and write a report on it. The teacher gives me 100s in the class no matter what cause I’m one of her favorite students, so I slack off all the time. I pop the first tab of ketamine. I wait 20-30 minutes.. Nothing happens. Literally nothing.

I’m pissed, whatever, it’s only 10 bucks, the tabs don’t do shit, fuck it. A says “that sucks, might as well pop the second one..” I pop the second tab.

All. Hell. Breaks. Loose. The second tab hits immediately after the first one, I immediately feel incapable of walking, and everything is incredibly distorted. Like being hammered on two bottles of vodka except feeling alert at the same time. My body was drunk, my mind was fine.

It’s getting close to the bell ringing and class ending. My next class is credit recovery, which is another computer lab except it’s halfway across the school and it’s a class where you can redeem credits for classes that you failed previously. I find myself not even being able to walk... every time I stand up I feel my sense of gravity losing its meaning, I watch in horror as my body stumbled and can’t seem to tell where I should step next.

My vision starts to double, and triple, and quadruple, all the sounds around me are echoing in my brain. I am completely disoriented. I ask A to help me to my next class.
This is an interesting part of the story.

Here I am, underestimating my first dose of ketamine, two friends, A and “V” are hoisting my body up, and guiding me to my credit recovery class. And I mean literally, they’re on either side of me, my arms over each of their shoulders, they’re picking me up and gliding me to class while I just look completely fucked up.

Thankfully, we didn’t run into any teachers, but passed maybe a hundred other kids in the hallway on the way to my next class, and they all seem to have given me strange looks, even in my quadruple vision state... I get to credit recovery, thank god, no one found me out. All I have to do is sit down, pretend to be sick, and wait out the high.

I never did shit in that class anyway, so the “teacher” there didn’t expect a thing, I pretended with my body language to be having a bad day, and I told the teacher I was sick, and laid my head down at my computer station. He didn’t say anything to me and ignored me. This is when I fell into my first K-hole.

I put my earbuds in, pink floyd playlist. And I put my head down on top of my arms, fighting my nausea. “The Division Bell” from pink floyd is playing, tik tok... tik tok... I fall deeper and deeper into disassociation... I begin to hallucinate more and more with my eyes closed.

Still feeling incredibly nauseous, like I’m about to have to throw up, I feel my legs turning gelatinous and visually and physically it feels as though my legs have turned into drills that are drilling past the concrete of the floor and into the earths crust, only to loop back up miles away and burst through the surface far away from where they started, then looped back down into the earth and drilled more holes only to loop back up again miles and miles away. 

Eventually I separated from my body and found myself hovering above a vague image of pyramids and stars. The feeling of nausea slowly goes away as does the feeling of my own self perception and everything around me. The teacher probably thinks I’m asleep. But i’m in actuality in an intense drug induced, coma copycat of a drug. This goes on for a full hour and a half. The bell rings.

As I’m walking to my next class, I don’t even remember what the class was at this point, the hallway is extending farther then getting super close, I’m seeing everything in quadruples still, literally my vision is split in 4 pieces, and all the sounds are echoing over and over in my head. I thought surely someone is going to notice me and catch me.

I arrive to my next class where I sit next to my other friend, we will call her “H”. As everything is a quadruple image spinning around each other in circles, I’m trying to keep my shit together and act normal. She says “I know you love pink floyd so I brought you this-“, She reaches into her bag and pulls out a piece of paper..

She then lifts this small square piece of paper in the air, and she takes her hands away from it as the piece of paper floats in mid air. I watch in amazement as the piece of paper literally unfolds itself into a giant pink floyd poster. 
“HOLY SHIT THAT WAS AWESOME” I said, she laughs and says I can have the poster...

To this day that poster hangs in my room and serves as a memory of my first ketamine experience that was at school.. and I’m going to be honest, I don’t remember the rest of the school day or how I got home. I do however, remember the come up, the K-hole, and the poster. This was back in 2014.

I hope you enjoyed the tale of my first ketamine experience, I felt like maybe some people would enjoy having a read, doing it in school was one of my most intense drug experiences ever, trying to hide my high was close to impossible, but if you read this whole thing, thank you, and I hope you found it interesting.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,689467,public,confidence,self,My first K-hole was at school.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hgo0r2/my_first_khole_was_at_school/,,no_ads,0.0,1593265414.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I knew something was up with him lately because he's been saying some pretty crazy stuff, mainly fixated on our upstairs neighbors. He's been claiming that they run a meth operation, that they want to kill us, that they want to kill his parents, that they were able to give him cancer somehow with their hate. He says that he can hear them talking shit about him, but we've hardly ever even seen our neighbors, and they have always seemed perfectly nice and normal (we've lived here 4 years) and I have never been able to hear anything they're saying. He's obviously been having hallucinations. I thought maybe it was from lack of sleep and because he took some ecstasy a few days ago, maybe it was laced with something? 

Anyway, I found out last night that he was using heroin again. He was saying he was trying to kill himself, that he had to, and had taken what seemed like a lot (2 insulin syringes worth?) and was trying to take more, so I called 911. He had been clean for almost 10 years, but I guess he has been using for the past couple of weeks, which coincides with roughly the time these delusions and paranoia started. 

He's in a psychiatric facility involuntarily now, and he called me today saying that people there were talking about me and that I should leave the house, maybe leave town for a while. None of these people know I even exist, let alone where I live. This has all been kind of overwhelming.

I've tried to do some online searching on heroin and hallucinations, but couldn't find any concrete evidence that says delusions and hallucinations are a side effect of heroin use, and it seems like it might be uncommon. Has anyone here experienced similar psychosis while using heroin, or might know more about it? How long after using can these delusions last? Does he have brain damage or something? I'm really just trying to understand what he's going through and what to expect for when he gets out of the hospital so I can be supportive but also prepare myself.

Tl;dr: Boyfriend relapsed with heroin, has been hearing things and acting really paranoid and delusional. Wondering if anyone has experienced something similar.

I obviously understand that narcotics and especially mixing them is never a safe option, but I feel I am going to go through with it either way unless I am told it’s an especially bad combination, 

so please refrain from simply telling me drugs are bad! Thank you haha 

I’ve swallowed about 80 mgs of dextroamphetamine (An ADHD stimulant that I get prescribed) 
I’m thinking of having about 7 drinks soon and then also combining it with diazepam. Maybe like 10mgs or so.

Is this known to be an especially harmful mix or should it be alright?
Thanks a lot for the help in advance I appreciate it.

A friend of mine told me that there was this drug where you could actually start to trip and see stuff that isn't there. I've told him that I already did truffles and really liked it and I'd love to take it up a notch. So eventually I bought this tab from a guy who told me there was 240µg on it. Me who wasn't really familiar in the psychs world didn't really believe it at first and thought I'd just take the whole tab and maybe smoke a little bit of weed while in the peak.

On the 20th of June my friends and I wanted to see each other and I decided to take the tab then at noon and then enjoy my trip till midnight or even after midnight, smoke a joint and fall asleep. Boy oh boy, I didn't know what was coming. At 4:15pm I took the tab and let it sit under my tongue for about 30 to 40 minutes. My friend suggested to hike for a bit while the effects started to come up. After a 5 minute walk I started to see the leaves move a bit and I started to see lots of beautiful patterns in the grass, on the ground and in the sky. I had to sit down for a bit since it all became a little too much. I had to get comfortable with the current effects that I was seeing. After sitting down and smoking a cig for 10 minutes we decided to go for a walk again. While we were walking I started to see this path full of super bright fading lights and patterns. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Me, who was thinking I took like 150µg didn't know that there was so much more to come. After a hike of 2 hours I started to feel really heavy and had the impression that my face was melting off my head. I had to put on some sunglasses since there were lots of people passing by walking their dog, on the bike, etc. No one noticed luckily that I was tripping balls. At a certain point my friend told me that he had this small clubhouse where we could chill for a bit and where they could roll a pure joint and just have a chill time while I could enjoy my trip and thoughts which were rushing through my head. After a few minutes walking we got there and as soon as I entered the room I felt so heavy and I couldn't speak anymore. I finally realized that this was the peak. This was it, these effects, these thoughts, these feelings would last for at least 6-8 hours. At a certain moment I couldn't even talk anymore, my friends were asking what I was seeing or thinking but everything went so fast and was so intense that I didn't even have the courage to talk about the trip. I tried opening my mouth but all there came out of it was ""I have like.. I feel like.. I see like.."" but that was it. I couldn't exactly describe what was going on inside of me. I eventually just told them ""If you guys could see through my eyes you would be freaking out.."" and started to laugh. They laughed with me and thought everything was going well. After smoking a bunch of cigs I decided to take it up a notch and asked my friend to smoke a joint. They already rolled the pure one but were already so blazed that they couldn't even get up and go outside to smoke one. After I convinced them to go outside I was just so curious to know how it'd feel like smoking pot on weed. Well, I got what I wanted. I took around 6 long hits of this pure, fat joint. At first it didn't seem like there was going something on. I felt the same as an hour ago and told them; ""This weed is shit, let me get a few more drags.."". In total I took around 10 long drags of the joint and boy oh boy.. the LSD really kicked my ass. We went inside and as soon as the environment changed I started to see these really crazy visuals where I was looking like in a TV. The TV screen was focused and everything around it was morphing and slowing down. I remember looking at a chair and the chair seemed to get eyes and it was telling me ""Dude, you're sitting on me. Can you imagine that? You're literally using me to sit your lazy ass down.."". I started to burst out in laughing and pointed at the chair. My friends were kinda freaked out since it seemed like I was almost angry at that chair. My head started to feel so heavy that I had to sit down on the floor and eventually listened to the chair. It almost seemed like the chair had control over my thoughts. After a few minute passed by of thinking about my life I started to feel really weird. I forgot I had smoked from the joint. I was thinking that I took this LSD, that my friends were going to leave me behind and that I never was going to get out of this trip. They were going to leave me tripping and that this is how I was going to die. I convinced myself that this was literally how I was going to die. I remember thinking to myself ""Dude, is this the life you chose? You literally took acid with the wrong people. They're going to let you die here and you're going to trip the fuck out."". Since all my thoughts went so fast I couldn't talk to my friends to tell them that I was having a bad trip. During the bad trip which lasted for a whopping 6 to 8 hours I eventually came to the realization that the bond with my friends were so strong, and that they wouldn't leave me behind. I was fighting the bad trip inside my head. I told the LSD multiple times to literally fuck off and to get outside of my head. At a certain moment it felt like the time was going so slow and it almost felt like every second was 0.00001 milisecond. I remember hearing and seeing everything in super slow motion. It felt like I was stuck in an infinite time loop. I just couldn't believe that time was going so slow. In my head I wanted to tell my friends ""Dude, do you guys also feel that? The time is so slow!"". In my head it felt like I was speaking in slow motion, until the day after they told me that I was just speaking normally. It felt all so unreal and fake. I didn't have the feeling that this trip was bringing anything new to the table. I started reliving all my traumas from before. I remember seeing myself getting beated up by my dad. I was crying so hard in my head and was screaming for help of the top of my lungs. I didn't literally scream, but my head was so desperate for help. All this time I ignored my traumas and thought they'd pass over time. But no, the LSD literally gave me a plate with all my traumas and made me forcefully eat it. It had to show my pain and troubles I was going in to really realize what was really going on inside of me. 

After 8 hours of just sitting there and having the worst 8 hours of my life we eventually decided to sit in a forest and talk about how the trip went. I started crying like a baby and they hold me tight. I told them everything that was going on and started venting to them about my traumes. Which I normally NEVER EVER do to my friends. A passenger passed by walking her dog. She looked at me straight in the eyes and asked my friends ""Is he okay? What's up with him?"". I felt as if my pupils were going to explode. My friends eventually lied to her and just said ""He's alright, he's just telling his troubles in life and needed to vent a little bit"". I wanted to pet the dog so bad since it gave me this feeling of comfort and happyness. The dog seemed so scared of me and it almost looked like it wanted to adopt me. It probably thought I was lost in the woods and started sniffing around to maybe find the person who did this to me. After a while the dog started barking at me and that's when I knew it knew that I was having such a bad time on the acid. 

Fast forward 2 hours, we walked back to my place. The comedown was already starting and everything started to cool down. We smoked a few joints before going to bed and ended the evening with Family Guy and some good, healthy food. 

The day after I felt so shit, I felt as if something was missing inside of me. I don't know what the LSD wanted to tell me but I knew that it wanted to show me things that I never really confronted myself. I have taken too much and I have smoked pot on the trip, which caused the bad trip. But I also know that I still have a lot of trouble in my life which I never really wanted to congront. Even now I still have a lot of questions, but who should I ask? Where should I place this? Well, I convinced myself that I am going to start meditating and start doing more stuff which I really enjoy. I feel a lot more connected to nature now. I feel as if I was reborn and made into a better person. My curiosity was so much that I didn't want to listen to people's advice. I feel as if I'm a whole different person now. Not in a bad way, more as in a way where I really want to work on myself and really see the pain I'm facing in the eye. 

I'd like to thank you for reading this story, and I sincerely apologize to myself for not listening. I learned my lesson and this didn't scare me to never try LSD again. In a way I'd love to try it again but with more responsibility and with more caution. I never knew weed intensified the trip so much. I hope you enjoyed my trip report and I hope that you're doing great. Never hesitate to ask my any questions about the trip or to give me any more advice. I'm open to any questions or whatever!

Hello dear tweaker friends, it is I, Joey the shark tooth. Here are my thoughts on harm reduction. 

I would like to point out that harm reduction is highly personal and individualistic. Meaning that harm reduction for a homeless 120 pound IV 
meth and fentanyl addict is going to look very different than harm reduction for your on-the-weekend-quarter-gram-maximum meth user. 

Personally, I have met many people in recovery and still actively using who tend to push their own practices of harm reduction on to other people, which is counterproductive and which increases the possibility that the recipient of the advice will ignore harm reduction practices overall. (NOTE: I am not singling anyone out or pointing fingers at people on this forum; please don’t take it that way)

For example. Homeless 120 pound IV meth and fentanyl addict (lets call him Joey) is at the drop-in centre using the computers to mess around on his reddit account. He posts on r/meth a story about him slamming a two gram shot of ice from an unknown dealer and getting so high that the world turns purple and his heart beats so hard that it can be heard from 50 feet away. Now some gung-ho, trigger-happy (and maybe a little bit self righteous) “pro-harm-reduction” r/meth user comments an 800-word essay about how Joey should be taking Vitamin-this and supplement-that and getting lots of sleep and good food and that snorting is safer than IVing and smaller amounts are better. You think Joey has got the cash to buy a whole bunch of vitamins? You think Joey has a safe place to sleep for 8 hours a day? You think Joey can access three meals a day full of all your finest fibres, proteins and nutrients? You think that snorting 50mg of meth a day would get Joey anywhere near high enough to satisfy his most gentle of cravings? 

What Joey needs to hear is... did you know there’s a needle exchange over on_______? Did you know that rotating which vein you hit can keep them from collapsing? Did you know that there’s a medication called PrEp that protects against HIV? Did you know that boofing can get you almost as high as IVing? Does Joey have access to mental health support? Is Joey looking to cut down his use or quit? No? Then Joey, to avoid ODing, would you consider doing a tester-shot before slamming that whole two grams, especially when it’s from a new dealer?  

TLDR/Main points
Essentially, the point of this post is to remind my peers on r/meth that harm reduction is not a concrete set of rules applicable to anyone and everyone. Harm reduction practices need to be tailored to suit each and every addict’s situation. Furthermore, harm reduction practices are about increasing awareness and providing information to drug users, not forcing them upon unwilling drug users. So, if you’re going to give someone harm reduction advice, please, PLEASE make sure you’re not just telling them what works for YOU, but things that might work for THEM according to their situation (which you know all about already because of course you took the time to ask the person a question or two before jumping to the conclusion that their life is exactly the same as yours).

Told myself I'd never drink, never smoke, none of it. Caffeine, maybe, but caffeine doesn't count.

4 years ago I smoked weed and drank some vodka at a party and it was incredible. I told myself that everyone drank so it was okay, and weed was something everyone's done so it didn't really count as doing drugs.

3 years ago I tried mushrooms and my mind was expanded, I loved it. I told myself that because it was just another plant it was okay- all natural and fine for my body.

2 years ago I started vaping and got addicted to nicotine. I told myself that vaping wasn't as bad as smoking, that every young adult my age vaped a little, so it wasn't a huge deal.

Last year I tried acid for the first time and once again my mind was opened to psychedelics. I had huge revelations about life and told myself it was okay because acid is cheap and you can't do it too often and the chance of getting addicted was so so low.

This year I tried xanax and after a night of feeling the most relaxed and at peace I'd ever felt I took back any shaming I'd done on people that used pills.

My point here is- the line of drugs that are ""bad"" has always kept moving for me, further and further, over the last 5 years. I am curious to what you all have decided is your own line? Have you ever crossed it? Would you ever do it again? Why did you set yourself that rule? A few years ago did you think you would be using in the same way you were, or using at all?

I think about this frequently and am really interested in the discussion on it, because everyone's path to drugs is unique and meaningful, even if it wasn't anything more complicated than getting crossfaded at a party in highschool to set you off.

For me, I have decided that anything that has a very high risk of addiction or harm to my body or overdose I will be avoiding.

First is what I have tried. 

Tried cigarettes and tobacco in middle school. Hated them. Probably won’t ever try them again. 

I used Adderall recreationally when I was 8th grade- sophomore (prescribed for ADHD). No longer use this. 

Started drinking with friends and getting hammered whenever I could on the weekends all throughout high school. And now I drink beer pretty much every week but haven’t gotten shit faced drunk in a long time. 

I used LSD for the first time going into my junior year. I love it and it’s changed my perspective on life. Use it more than I did in high school but I don’t abuse it. 

Surprisingly I didn’t even try marijuana until after I graduated highschool. I pretty much smoke everyday now. About 1 or 2 blunts a day. 

I’ve tried OxyContin one time. I don’t really remember how it made me feel other than it felt like I kept falling asleep and waking up over and over. 
 
Now things I want to try. 

MDMA-I’ve has 2 points of molly in crystal form for awhile now, just never have had the right opportunity to give them a try. Going to try it while on Vacation next week. I’m excited. 
P.S. idk the difference between ecstasy and mdma, I’ve always thought they were the same thing. Someone care to explain?

Cocaine- I don’t have a super strong urge to try it due to its addictiveness and cost, however I do want to try it just for experience sake. 

Ketamine- don’t know a whole lot about it. Had an opportunity to try it but at the time I had no interest in snorting anything. I want to try it because it’s a hippie drug. And I’m a hippy lol

Mushrooms- really want to try mushrooms but for some reason I’m nervous about having a bad trip despite loving LSD and only having very few bad moments with L

Mescaline- don’t much about it but it sounds fun

DMT- I really want to try DMT sometime before I die. Don’t necessarily feel the need to try it anytime soon. But I definitely want to within the next 5-10 years

Whippets- want to give them a try although somebody has told me the high doesn’t last long and it’s not really worth it

we have obtained a lot of RCs recently, we live in the UK but have a contact in the US who has collected them in bulk and shipped a lot over to us at great expense

One friend took LSM-775 ( it’s like LSD with more body load), another friend took MT-45 (it’s an opiate with strong dissociative properties) and ket, 3 other people took mad honey (from the vice documentary), DiPT, BDB (it’s like MDA but more psychedelic) and another friend took shrooms, PCP (only one drag, it was a PCP analogue I think) and an unknown synthetic cannabinoid E liquid

Everyone takes their stuff at the same time and everyone is more nervous than usual due to the substances being unknown. The LSM kid begins to feel sick so I kick him out the house like he’s a stray cat, I told him to just do LSD and not LSM. The DiPT people are beginning to get worried because their voices sound weird due to sound distortion but the BDB begins to kick in and they stop being bothered by it. They try and make there voices sound normal to themselves but sound like Gollum in reality.

I ask the MT-45 kid to check on the LSM kid, he says sure but as he’s getting up he trips over nothing and falls over (he’s just done a several lines of k). So I go out to check on the LSM kid myself. I ask are you alright ? He laughs and says “you idiot don’t address my human self address the universe” I ask the universe if it’s ok and he reply’s “for the first time in a while yes” he proceeds to lie and shut his eyes. “I don’t need my body anymore, I’ve evolved beyond that” I say ok and go back inside

I go back in side to the MT-45 kid laying on a sofa in what looks like an opiate nod/k-hole, he seems to be enjoying himself though (eventually someone woke him up out of it with a line of coke). At this point the BDB kids are playing monopoly with a chess board and real money for some reason. They all still sound like Gollum and are very high. I had no idea what was going on about and had eyes like dinner plates, I thought I should check in on the shrooms kid at this point.

He appeared to be in the midst of a psychosis, he’s laughing like Walter white does when he finds out his wife has spent the last of his money paying of her boss, to cover up that fraud thing. It’s unnerving how much he’s laughing and I ask if he wants anything he replies “cats, more cats “ and begins to laugh harder, I say ok and slowly back away... This guy is notorious for not being able to handle drugs this guy took one hit of a meth laced vape and went completely insane, he has no mental health issues tho he’s just a light weight 

Everyone sobers up accept one BDB kid, he took more mad honey than everyone else and it gave him delirium ? He was fucked for hours talking to people who weren’t there etc but apart from that no one was hurt and no one had a bad trip (unlike my last report, the report about people on hallucinogens, that was me with a different account)

My friend enjoyed LSM but despite having a good time says LSD is better, my friend who did MT-45 said he had the best night of his life, apparently mad honey is fun but  over priced, BDB is amazing but very similar to MDA apparently and DiPT was good my friends are going to combine it with LSD soon

A little disclaimer be careful with RCs, mainstream drugs are mainstream for a reason, we spent a lot of time researching the safety profiles. Also because we are not adults (15-16) are drugs more potent to us ? Has anyone else tried mad honey ? I’m interested in combining it with LSD at a theme park

My background I want share. Firstly, this post is not to promote drugs, this post is to teach teenagers that are about to use drugs, and tell them the consequences, the downs, the depression, the brain damages, and all negativities.Because we adults definetly know that telling dont do is not gonna do anything :) So better guide for safety no one gets harmed.

What things Below that I have used for long term what I call (1-6 months)

1) Weed (3 years, every morning, every lunchtime, every afternoon , every night ; basically till I pass out peacefully, what I call dying :) )

2) LSD( I did this 3 times, first one was Microdosing 25ug done for 2 weeks, second one for spirituality purposes which really scared me but no traumas thanks God that was extreme dosage 600ug, third time was more conscious and not crazy which was 250ug and that was a lovely experience walked outside slowly with Hiphop on my ear to cancel bad trips and stick to lyrics singing watching the sun rising, sittin on grass meditating with Theta Waves Sounds in my ear.)

3) Mushrooms( Many many times, just for fun no spirtuality. I wish I done for spirituality after I made some research Mushrooms and meditating is real good one trust me. I tried the Chocolate ones, mushroom as itself ones original, and one time I did Mushroom which was the first time I tried I was a bit coward :) So I drank whiskey with it and it was really enjoyable but I ended up doing barfix with my friends outside at 3 AM injured my hand then I was saying funny things like “Damn Im a Army Veteran, be a Soldier , bring me some whiskey we pour the this wound so bacterias die” I was damn crazy, actually Im still crazy and fun for many people ahahah)

4) Ketamine (I hated it, why the hell I would try that man. I dont like things that makes me dumb, slow thinking, slow response. But Im hyprocrite check out the 5th step and you get me)

5)Codeine with Promethazine( My favorite, I got addicted to this one, I dont recommend to any of you guys, oxycodone too . Dont do it stay away! The withdrawals of it!?? Oh - My- Dear- Lord. Whole body hurts 24/7, when you lie down to bed it still hurts, you cant go to sleep, I even couldnt sleep with weed when I quit codeine , the weed was like not effecting at all, it was weird, and trust me I only get the A+ stuff, but overall I loved Codeine, calming down, but dangerous sometimes because if you miss the dose and keep goin your heart stops , its slows you that much.)

6) lyrica(pregabalin 300mg) my favorite in the whole drugs industry. I was a extreme alhocolic. I would wake up at 4 AM, and start drinking at 12:00 lunchtime starting with 2 double whiskies, then go lunch and have some Wine, dont even ask the rest of the day, 70cl Whiskey mostly half of it, Weed included, sometimes xanax included. Real blackout. Why I tell this? Because Lyrica is the drug that make me quit Alcohol. Basically it makes me calm,chill, talkative, motivated, uplifted, energetic, always wanna chat with people , normally Im shy really :)

7) Cocaine ( Maybe 7-10 lines working all nighter with coffee and weed to University things, was giving extreme dopamine to make me do work, but the wear off is like hell, and dangerous to mix with alcohol, so you have to hug the pain in this ones withdrawal)

8) MDMA (my favorite, I took it and its like my friend touched my arm I almost came ı swear. Its extreme warmness, extreme motivation, extreme talkativeness, very social, energetic, you would die because of the goodness of the music when you open it up. But stay away! Because I took it, and I was extremelly depressed, I sometimes cried because of sadness out of no where when alone , I cured this by weed, but Weed didnt even make me high at that time I swear on God.

9)Extacy with Molly (I did this 3 times, all for celebrating after Uni Exams by the force of my ex evil. No blame but she introduced to me these chemicals, otherwise Id never do antrhing else than Weed. This is the best I can say but not good as Mushrooms and LSD, this was like you look at your friends face, his face turns to like Avatar like Blue Effects around Fire around, very visual but never bad trippin because it boosts your seratonin, you wouldnt trip bad on this.

10) Homemade Ayahuasca (Syrian Rue+Acacia Confusa+Half Lemon Squeezed+Sea Salt one Nut large) - This was really good. But I tripped bad. It was a bad trip. Look , you see nothing scary, but you just feel like you so sticked to material world, and start feeling paranoid and unsafe. Ill figure this out and try again tho, am not gonna stop in this one.


Alright so lets start the guidance;

As an example;
1) If you taking MDMA always have a scale, and dont exceed the amount. When the MDMA wears of , if you cant bare the depression after that night dont take a second dosage ever, ever , never! Second dose can be good, but the next day? Im not even sayin only next day. The seratonin and dopamine will lack for months trust me. You wont find happiness for time.

So you took it measured it, drank some sprite for the bad taste (talking about pure crystal ones) 

Enjoy it, dont think bad things, and it wont make you think bad things this drug is like a happiness drug.

Dont mix with any alcohol, not even 1 beer. Are you gonna 100% die? No! But theres a chance of heart attack, statistics shows its more common in women. So dont mix. If you gonna mix with something and not listen to my words. Then mix with 1 pill of Extacy and enjoy it.

When the effects are gone, only thing you gonna do, and nothing else! Is take 2mg of Xanax with water. Lie down, open some chill music, wait till sleep comes. Sleep, rest your brain. Thats how you dont damage your brain. If you awake eithout sleeping, you gonna be depressive mood questioning bullshşt things. So set OFF your brain, sleep rest. Wake up and drink organic mixture of fruits juice. Eat eggs. Start a nice day.



For LSD; 12 hours its gonna last. But 6 hours is the max climax. Same tactic when its off, take xanax and sleep.

Mushrooms, anything you wanna do is fine dont worry :) Its fun.

Weed, do smoke weed when you on Mushrooms, when you on LSD, MDMA, Ex. Everything above. Always have weed with you roll like 5-10 rolls before taking the hard drugs. That weed gonna always put you in a calm trip relaxed trip.

Codeine with Prometh; take 3 caps of codeine pour it in to Sprite bottle filled with Sprite, drop a Prometh for nausea , because it really makes you so nauseous otherwise. Never mix with alcohol . İts already strong calming thing you wınt need it. Dont exceed 1 week , to prevent addiction. Do this 3 cap thing max 3 times a day. Dont overdıse its dangerous, you literally die.


Cocaine; you can multiple your doses at once. But just for once. Dont do all night. Take one bigline toright nose, take one big line to left nose. And you are fine for 1 hour. Dont waste the drug by taking more before 1 hour. Take xanax if you so depressed after your Cocaine finished at the end of the night.

Lyrica: Take 1 pill first, enjoy it its lovely. Next day take 600 up to 900 mg. 

Only problem with high dose is it makes your hands shake , buzz. So if you use in public and get paranoid about gettin exposed only 1 pill enough to be social.


My hands tired. Ill keep writing my experiences. This is me when I was 19-20-21-22-23. Now Im off , just doing some xannies when I wanna celebrate.

Those of you who immediately respond with concern to that please save it, I know what I’m doing and how stupid it is I just don’t care, and there’s nothing random people on the internet can do to change my entire life anyways.

It’s mostly just weed. I probably could smoke a half oz a week if I had a choice, so around $90 a week. I also probably have a $80-$90 a week Adderall problem. I can easily go without the weed but I definitely want to spend that much on adderall every week. My mom is extremely unsupportive of me doing drugs and literally obsessed with trying to keep me from smoking “pot”. But she has no idea about any of the other drugs I do. 

To be honest, I’ve financed my addiction by leaching off my friends and family and stealing   for months. I really don’t like it. The sneaking around, being obsessed with family members wallets and whether they are unattended, peaking through the blinds every 30 minutes to see if my sisters car is still in the driveway so I can steal her pen. Its really fucked up and makes me feel like such a terrible person (I’ve never broken the law, cheated, stole, or done anything unethical aside from doing it for drugs) so I’ve been looking for a job for a long while so I can just support my own habit and my family won’t be hurt by it. Along comes a $10/hr dishwashing job at a local restaurant. 7-9 hour shifts 5 days a week. Could be worse right? Well reality is basically no. My feet and hands are literally bleeding and my hands are covered in sores, cuts and burns. I work closer to 10 hours a day with no breaks except for the bathroom. It’s basically hell on earth. But I survived, basically by fantasizing about the drugs I was gonna buy with the paycheck I’d get from the work. I got through every hour by envisioning each hour as a gram in a joint. I literally skipped into work today knowing I was getting paid and was ecstatic and telling myself this is the last day I ever have to come into this awful job sober. 

Well I’ve been working for like 2 weeks and I just got my first paycheck for around $230 (when I work my first full weeks it will eventually become about $350 a week). And then I realized something. They literally just give me a useless piece of paper with a number on it once a week. All my other jobs before this was never a problem because I didn’t actually intend to spend the money. My mom told me she’ll bring me to the bank in a few days and set up an account, and she’ll MONITOR MY FUCKING TRANSACTIONS. 

I literally only got this job to buy drugs and I DEFINITELY only suffered through it because I knew it would get me drugs. And now I can’t even fucking get them.

we have obtained a lot of RCs recently, we live in the UK but have a contact in the US who has collected them in bulk and shipped a lot over to us at great expense

One friend took LSM-775 ( it’s like LSD with more body load), another friend took MT-45 (it’s an opiate with strong dissociative properties) and ket, 3 other people took mad honey (from the vice documentary), DiPT, BDB (it’s like MDA but more psychedelic) and another friend took shrooms, PCP (only one drag, it was a PCP analogue I think) and an unknown synthetic cannabinoid E liquid

Everyone takes their stuff at the same time and everyone is more nervous than usual due to the substances being unknown. The LSM kid begins to feel sick so I kick him out the house like he’s a stray cat, I told him to just do LSD and not LSM. The DiPT people are beginning to get worried because their voices sound weird due to sound distortion but the BDB begins to kick in and they stop being bothered by it. They try and make there voices sound normal to themselves but sound like Gollum in reality.

I ask the MT-45 kid to check on the LSM kid, he says sure but as he’s getting up he trips over nothing and falls over (he’s just done a several lines of k). So I go out to check on the LSM kid myself. I ask are you alright ? He laughs and says “you idiot don’t address my human self address the universe” I ask the universe if it’s ok and he reply’s “for the first time in a while yes” he proceeds to lie and shut his eyes. “I don’t need my body anymore, I’ve evolved beyond that” I say ok and go back inside

I go back in side to the MT-45 kid laying on a sofa in what looks like an opiate nod/k-hole, he seems to be enjoying himself though (eventually someone woke him up out of it with a line of coke). At this point the BDB kids are playing monopoly with a chess board and real money for some reason. They all still sound like Gollum and are very high. I had no idea what was going on about and had eyes like dinner plates, I thought I should check in on the shrooms kid at this point.

He appeared to be in the midst of a psychosis, he’s laughing like Walter white does when he finds out his wife has spent the last of his money paying of her boss, to cover up that fraud thing. It’s unnerving how much he’s laughing and I ask if he wants anything he replies “cats, more cats “ and begins to laugh harder, I say ok and slowly back away... This guy is notorious for not being able to handle drugs this guy took one hit of a meth laced vape and went completely insane, he has no mental health issues tho he’s just a light weight 

Everyone sobers up accept one BDB kid, he took more mad honey than everyone else and it gave him delirium ? He was fucked for hours talking to people who weren’t there etc but apart from that no one was hurt and no one had a bad trip (unlike my last report, the report about people on hallucinogens, that was me with a different account)

My friend enjoyed LSM but despite having a good time says LSD is better, my friend who did MT-45 said he had the best night of his life, apparently mad honey is fun but  over priced, BDB is amazing but very similar to MDA apparently and DiPT was good my friends are going to combine it with LSD soon

A little disclaimer be careful with RCs, mainstream drugs are mainstream for a reason, we spent a lot of time researching the safety profiles. Also because we are not adults (15-16) are drugs more potent to us ? Has anyone else tried mad honey ? I’m interested in combining it with LSD at a theme park

Very social and laughing a lot. I usually drink on this day but the person I drink with could or didn’t want to that’s why I use dxm in the first place. Anyways later in the night he decided to get two tall boys. I was starting to come down from peak at that point. I drank two tall boys plus a left over normal 12oz beer. About 20-30 mins later the beer starts kicking in. My vision becomes blurry and wavy. I cannot walk very well unless completely focuses on it. I started getting this “tunnel vision“ where the sides of my vision would white out. I was being very obnoxious but he just thought I was a light weight that night lol. The when my wife took me home the music was very intense in the car. Usually on dxm I can’t sleep and stay up hours upon hours after the trip. I guess alcohol took over because when I got home I took a shower and feel asleep after instantly. Next dxm I don’t have the after glow. Quite the opposite.

I know some people would, but I’m being honest here. Anyways here it goes:

So far I’ve tried shrooms, molly, and LSD. Personally my favorite is molly, except for the comedown/tweaky feeling after the first few hours. Next is shrooms, although I didn’t really take enough to “hallucinate”, I had just a brighter view of the world and a better mental state. It was beautiful and fun. Finally is LSD. Yes, I still do kinda like it, but only for the visuals. Again, don’t make fun of me thinking “what kind of idiot only takes acid for the visuals”? That’s just how I am. I’ve taken LSD about 3 times, all in gradual doses, and I hate both the comedown and just mind fuck effect. It just fucks with me in a way I know is meant to be good, but it just comes off as weird to me and I don’t like it. I prefer the visual trip, not the mental one.

So my question is what’s the best psychedelic to stick to that tripping visually? Would it be molly? Or another one I’m not thinking of?

So i have two takes on it:
1st: either my brain has been altered in such a way that its became sensitive to them
2nd: or its that shilajit
Im doing an experiment with a friend and give him shilajit for a week and hell smoke weed and possibly do a psychedelic while and after the week of taking shilajit to further see if this absolutely because of the shilajit or jus my brain.

I’ve already done some research and feel fairly confident about trying it out. Here’s some background information :D

I intend to start with a half dose, am going to try it with a friend (it’s his first time too) and we intend to have someone watch over us during the trip. The deed will be done at his house where it’s safe. As I’ve said, I’ve done some research on this subreddit as well as r/LSD and have a couple of questions to ask!

1. Are LSD and acid the same? Because i’ve been told by my plug that LSD is more trippy but acid gives a better high. But it seems that LSD and acid are viewed as the same thing on the two subreddits. Should I be worried? My plug assures me the acid he’s providing should be fine as I’ve never had bad trips on molly or weed. 

2. What should I do/watch/listen to while coming up, at the peak and coming down? I know these are all stages while tripping, but should I do different things during these different stages?

3. If I start with a half dose, assuming the potency is your average tab, does the trip still last about 8-10 hours or is it shorter?

That’s all, thank you for taking the time to read this post :D. Looking forward ron hear from you guys!

11 am: I took 2 and a bit tablespoons of freshly ground nutmeg and some ginger for nausea and diluted it in some water
1 pm: I started feeling something but it quickly wore off. ( My guess is that it was placebo) 
2 pm: I ground up some more nutmeg. Like another 2 tablespoons and diluted it in water.
3 pm: I started to feel a little hazy but in a good way.
5 pm: It really started hitting. I felt pretty good. I felt stoned and a little drunk.
6 pm: I felt crazy stoned. Like I had smoked a fat ass blunt. It was so relaxing. I had a stoned mindset and my limbs felt heavy.
7 pm: I was still coming up and felt so euphoric. I went and got some stuff to eat and drink cause I had the munchies.
10 pm: This was the highest I felt from the nutmeg. It was almost IDENTICAL to being stoned. I chilled on my bed vaping and vibing to some good ass music (which sounded incredible by the way) I felt like I was on a boat rocking back and forth when I closed my eyes.
12 am: I started getting pretty tired so I took my meds and tried to go to sleep but I just kept laughing at my own thoughts. Eventually I managed to fall asleep. My dreams were VERY vivid and trippy but pleasent and entertaining for the most part.

my amazing brother and other friend took care of me while i calmed down. besides the looping i mostly just felt nausea and overheating after going inside. after like 2 hours and a lot of vomiting i felt mostly normal again. don't be dumb like me and underestimate drugs

My friend, lets call him M, and I use drugs a lot. Mostly just weed or acid. But since we're in Vermont we don't really have easy access to what we normally do. What we do have is a Walgreens with Benadryl. M has always told me about his Benadryl trips, so I thought that I would try. 

I started with 5 pills, no idea how many milligrams, but I didn't really feel anything. So I did 5 move, and then another 5. Finally I stopped, when I started to feel it in my face, eyes, hands, and arms.

About ten minutes in, M told me that for this to work I would have to fight off the feeling of being tired. So we played cards, halfway through the game I could not for the life of me focus, but it felt good, so I kept myself awake. 

About 20 or so minutes in everything was super funny to me for about five minutes, I had to go to the bathroom and put water on my face to bring myself back.

After 30 minutes M was worried about me, I wasn't able to stand for long, and he would check my pulse every now and then, but he said I was fine. Anytime someone would touch me, my body would buzz and it felt really good. So M would just poke me for five or so minutes till I would get tired of it. 

At about the 1 hour mark, I started to hear small things that were not there, next I heard people calling my name, but no one was calling my name. M took me to the living room to watch Drake and Josh with the other people, hoping that I would calm down. After we watched a couple of episodes M told me that it was time for me to lay down and try and sleep. 

For the life of me I couldn't sleep, but it still sounded like people were calling for me, so I got up to go to the kitchen. The black of the tiles turned into black spiders, so I turned around and tried to sleep.

When I woke up the next morning my hands were very pale, purple, and I could see my veins very clearly, I was worried but not enough to panic and ask M for help about it. 

Now, as I sit here typing this, I am very anxious, any sudden movements around me from other people freak the fuck out of me. My heart rate is constantly raised. When people call my name, touch me, or is I fall my whole body buzzes.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend doing this for anyone else. I even myself do not want to do this again, but I know that I probably will because my body felt nice, not my mind, but my body.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,689337,public,confidence,self,Benadryl,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hgafh0/benadryl/,,no_ads,0.0,1593216541.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well about 2 months ago I ate a gummy worm bag that said it was 500 mg and the most I felt was tired and fairly high, but nothing that smoking couldn’t make me feel tbh. And same situation another month later with some 400mg cereal that didn’t hit at all, even less of a feeling. Now some things about my use, I use a stiizy and or cart from the dispo every night to go to bed and on occasion will smoke during the day, other wise my use is just nightly. Here’s where my theory gets introduced...so every time I had those edibles 2-3 years ago, I was young, I would always buy those street edibles a few weeks prior to taking them and they were kinda icky when I would go to eat them, a little stale but they always smacked. So anyways the other night I had a 700mg (supposed) homemade chocolate chip cookie that was a bit burnt and had been sitting in my drawer for about 3 weeks. Now that cookie got me high as hell, pretty damn similar to what I felt 2-3 years ago and I was happy lol I woke up high the next day and actually slept pretty much the whole next day as I was high for like 20hrs straight, it was crazy but I miss that feeling of being that high so I’m wondering, is it possible that letting an edible sit could somehow make it more potent? I know in most cases it does the opposite but I’m just confused as to how this edible hit me so hard when brand edibles from the dispo never hit me that hard. Also side note, my friend who smoke through the day almost every day took the same edible and didn’t feel much, and definitely wasn’t high the next day like I am.

Smoking weed afterwards, however, has been a strange high, where I get mild visuals (mostly with my eyes closed) and get stuck in my head. I thought I would take a break until last week, when I hit my friend's vape pen, and those effects came back again. Is this HPPD?

However, as much as I struggle with the motivation and focus side of ADHD, anxiety has always been my main battle. I have Aspergers aswell so it really badly affects my social skills, although I feel vyvanse makes me FEEL less anxious, I often find I am more tense in situations even if I feel somewhat better about being in them. If that makes sense?

I’ve never specifically tried an anti anxiety medication and I think it’s time I do.

I’ve tried loads of anti depressants before (I’ll never take a SSRI again) and I am currently on Mirtazapine which I think is a TCA? but I honestly don’t notice any difference on my anxiety and feeling more comfortable in social situations.

So, is there anything out there that I can take which can calm my anxiety more long term? And obviously something that won’t interact with the vyvanse.

I don’t really want to try Xanax or Valium or anything like that as I don’t trust myself to not get addicted and I just don’t want to put more hard drugs like that in my system. Anti depressants aren’t the one either. At least for my anxiety.

Can anyone recommend me medications that will be effective at calming me down and being less anxious overall, ideally (not sure if this is a thing) but I’d like to take something at the start of my day and feel it kick in and feel a lot calmer and less worried for the day.

Anyway we eat the truffles (half of my mates couldn't get more than halfway because of the taste, although I still reckon they tasted better than the ones picked here) and things are going great, definitely not as strong as the acid but it's definitely fucked us up, loads of giggles and really pretty visuals.

I don't know what caused it, I suspect possibly smoking too much weed with it (I smoke a lot) around half way through the trip (about 3 hours) I'm working on my third Joint, we're all watching a film having fun and suddenly all my teeth fall out, not literally but that's exactly what it felt like, like literally all my teeth were gone and my mouth was rotting away like a zombie, if I touched the roof of my mouth with my tongue it felt like I poked a hole through it, if I cleared my throat and phlegm was brought up it literally felt like I'd coughed up a tooth. 

It was seriously freaking me out, I checked in the mirror that my teeth were still there like 6 times. Now at this point I've not let any of my mates know I'm going through this nightmare because I was worried if I told them what was happening, it would incept the idea into them and they would all lose their teeth.

I remembered the man in the smart shop telling us not to eat any sugar or it will end the trip. Immediately tried to eat something sweet but it was impossible to chew and swallow in that state, so went to just drinking a sugary drink, which did nothing. 

Ended up just lightly pinching the skin of my hand with my teeth until the end of the trip, so that I knew my teeth were still there. Longest 3 hours of my life, ever, definitely the worst experience of my life. The first half was fucking Ace though.

Anyway since then I've done no psychedelics, but I was just wondering how likely is it that it's going to happen to me again if I trip?

3. Smoked an entire puffbar (legit bar, my friend who smokes tried mine and got the effects).
4. Smoked weed out of some shitty makeshift bong. Could've been the bong, but at the same time I felt NOTHING. My somewhat experienced smoker friend who was with me said that he got a bit of a high from it.
5. Taken several hits of DXM (enough to get to 1st/2nd plateau). I've tried several methods - straight cough syrup, extracted poli DXM (eating it dry, ""parachuting"", mixing with a soda).

Not a single one of these got me even slightly high or buzzed. Not a tingle, not a headrush, not adrenaline, not tired. Goddamned regular doses of ibuprofen had more of an effect than all of that.

Hey wassup guys. I had a life changing experience about five years ago and I think about it everyday to this day and I wanted to share this experience with everybody. 

Ok, so five years ago I was 16. I was always fascinated with acid, I thought the idea of ""seeing things"" and ""hallucinating"" was awesome. I use to always ask all my friends around town if they could get a hold of it, and they never could. Until one day, my ""friend,"" (lets call him M), hit me up saying he finally has it! I was excited! I made my way to him, and he pulled it out. Now, I do my research. I've found by researching that LSD usually comes in liquid form or tablets. This guy pulls out a tiny plastic bag, (it looked like a plastic wrap made into a box with a bottom on it) and the bag itself is literally empty, however there is white dust sprinkled on the wrap. It looked like as if someone dumped baby powder in the bag and dumped it out, how there was white dust speckled all over the insides of the bag. He tells me when i take this, to stick my tongue in the bag. I thought this was VERY odd, but I TRUSTED him. So I head over to my other friends house (lets call him V), and show him my prize. 

We observe the bag together, and he says he thinks that M ripped me off, because there was nothing in the bag. I was planning to take the drug at school (yes very stupid), however V's doubts made me want to do it right then and there to see if it was fake. So, I take the bag and put the whole thing in my mouth, and swish it around. I feel my tongue getting very numb, so I take the bag out, and throw it away. 

My tongue was feeling VERY NUMB and TINGLY until the trip started! Which was about after 15 minutes. Our other friend J comes by with his girlfriend right after I take it and I tell him what I did and what I felt like. He says cool, didnt really care that much. Our other friend P also comes by few minutes after J, then leaves shorty after. I also told him what was going on and he basically said good luck and have fun. 

So 10 minutes after I take the drug, J decides to go across town in his car for him and V to find out information on joining the army. THIS IS WHERE EVERYTHING STARTS GETTING CRAZY!!, bare with me trying to explain the unexplainable. 

5 minutes into the car ride I start feeing EXTREMELY STRANGE. I get this strange sensation in my back, and it was very uncomfortable, and I tried to shake the feeling off by repositioning myself in the back seat. Im sitting there squirming in the back seat next to V, and hes asking me if im ok. I tell him I feel weird, then I started to notice the world was looking like it was fading, but the colors were very bright. (This was my first time ever doing real drugs, I was use to DXM to trip). Every time I would ""trip"" on DXM I would look at my hands to see if the trip was kicking in, because my hands would always look like it had colors around my fingers when I was tripping. So I look at my hands in the car and they look distorted, out of shape with a small rainbow trace going around my fingers. But this was worse than usual, the visual was STRONG. The uncomfortable sensation started to flow through my whole body, and I just lay back, helpless. 

I ask V to hold my hand to make sure I dont die. He puts the seat back for me and holds my hand and I squeeze it as hard as I can. (I dont really know why, I was just scared). He lets go of my hand and I lay back helplessly. They show up to the place, but it turns out no one was there, so J dropped V and I off back at V's house, which was literally a couple houses down from mine. And that's exactly when I lost my mind.

I started to black out and enter a different dimension. I kept popping in and out of reality for brief moments. This part is very hard to explain so bare with me. 

Ok, so what happened was my reality was 100% replaced by these images in my mind. I was no longer at V's house. First, I remember seeing myself pixelated, with a all black background, and I was repeatedly grabbing my chest and with my right arm and throwing a whole bunch of small blue pixelated boxes in the air and it was falling to the ground. Im sitting here watching this like wait, wtf is going on right now? While viewing this world replacing image, at the same time, I feel EXTREME HAPPINESS like never felt before. It was as if I had a happy button and was smashing it relentlessly. I was just HAPPY. I didnt know what the hell was happening, but I was happy as hell. 

Then for a brief moment (literally like two seconds) I snap into reality in V's room to see my cell phone ringing. Everything looked like it was literally under water, and at the time I looked at my phone, I seen it ringing and vibrating, but it didnt occur to me that it was my phone. I didnt even know what a phone was, and I didnt really care. I snap back into the new dimensions instantly. 

I was in this place, that was undescribable. It looked like a really Fd up image of i dont even know, and I heard weird loud laughing noises, but not regular laughing, more like insane, psycho, trippy laughing. It was SCARY as hell!! I remember thinking ""wait a minute, I was just at V's house! How did I get to this place? Where am I? What street did I take or what house did I walk into to be in this, THING? I was aware of myself not being in reality. I was just there. Thinking damn, I have absolutely no idea whats happening in the real world right now, but i sure hope im ok. 

Next thing i remember seeing is broken and melted bits and parts of V's living room, but in a Green, then switching to blue, then different color TINTS, still with the scary laughing going on. Its like my vision was a camera filter, EVERYTHING was INSANELY AND UNBELIEVABLY changing different colors, RAPIDLY. Im thinking damn, my brain is literally FRIED right now, I cant tell what's happening. 

Next thing I remember seeing was this GIF of me my brain was playing in full screen of my reality, replacing my body and awareness of earth. I saw myself in third person standing in front of my old house, and this GIF or moving image was blinking different colors like red blue purple green extremely rapidly like changing color every .1 seconds. What I saw myself doing was, my shoes would untie, Then I saw myself going to tie my shoes, then my belt buckle would undo. Then I’ll go to fix my belt, then my hat would fall off. Then I would get my hat and put it on, then my shoes would untie. Then I’ll tie my shoes and this loop went on for what felt like (time felt unlinear) 1-2 minutes?? It felt intense and as I watched this happen it also felt like it was happening to me. It was insane! 

Anyway, it turns out I was suppose to go out to eat with my mom and family, and my mom was the one who was calling me earlier. ( I ALWAYS answer the phone for them, but V told me he was literally holding my phone in my face saying my mom was calling and i kept saying I don't care and actually threw my phone). So I remember V pointing out the window saying my grandma is walking up the street for me. We both get down on the ground behind the couch (LOL) and I checked out again, while he was a trying to figure out what to do. He had no choice but to open the door, so he did. My grandma barges in the door yelling at me and snatches me out the house. I didnt even have my shoes on. Shes yelling at me walking back to my house, with no shoes on, and i kept blacking out, but remember seeing these fat psychodelic bumble bees hovering over my head turning their head along with my face of direction. 

I meet my mom at my house whos going crazy trying to figure out whats wrong with me and puts me in her car to go to the hospital. V walks down with my shoes, and just told my mom I came there like that and he didnt know what was wrong with me. So it gets even WORSE!!! 
I black out the entire way there and wake up in the hospital halI way. When I wake up, it feels like my brain is completely shutting down. I seen a lighting bolt across my field of vision, and remembered my brain feeling fried and I was having massive open eyed visuals. 

I started to HEAR REAL VOICES. I heard the voices of all my friends and people I care about.. All the friendly voices were saying VERY fucked up things about me. I heard my best friends saying im a drug addict, saying i aint shit and making fun of me. The voices were so real I thought they actually came with me to the hospital and I overheard them speaking in the other room. This was extremely confusing. 

I black out again, and I wake up in the bathroom with my mom. I ACTUALLY believed that I DIED from the drugs, and the bathroom was some kind of place of the afterlife. I thought this because the whole room was BREATHING intensely. My mom is trying to ask me whats wrong with me but for some reason i kept ignoring her, i was so lost in my mind. Everytime I went to the toilet or the sink, I LITERALLY felt like my life was being drained from me. I would go to the sink to look in the mirror, and feel myself  being drained, then go sit on the toilet top, then get up immediately because I forgot it was draining my life. For some reason, i literally believed every thought that came to my head. I looked in the mirror once more and for some reason thought i got jumped. I saw blood dripping from my nose and I looked beat up. I go to wipe the blood with my hand and nothing was there. 

Then my mom was asking me again what's wrong with you and I looked at her and she started AGING EXTREMELY QUICKLY RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES!! She started growing grey hairs, was getting wrinkles, and getting old all within about 5 seconds. I looked back in the mirror and I swear to god I see a HUGE GREEN THICK ENERGY SURGE JUST FLOWING ALL AROUND MY BODY like some shit from dragon ball z! And i was getting taller and getting huge muscles all within a 5 second time span. Then, (my mom was pregnant) I thought I ruined my life and died as me by drugs and I was going to be given a second chance at life by becoming my little sister. I look my mom straight in the face and tell her I don't want to be a girl. Shes like what are you talking about? Lets go!

 Suddenly I hear the voices of my FRIENDS again! Theyre saying that as soon as i open the bathroom door, they are gonna beat the living shit out of me and they were telling eachother ""let me hit him first, no let me hit him first!"" And heard them pounding their fists. I thought my mom was setting me up! I told her im not going out there! Shes like come on come on trust me whats wrong with you,? And im like no im not going, screw that. Then for some reason this idea came to my head that this 6'7 guy I know R, was gonna come in the bathroom and rape me if I didnt go out there. I finally decided ok screw THAT! and walked out the bathroom door with my mom looking for my friends, and they were no where to be found. I got a sense of relief. 

After that, I remember sitting in this bed giving my mom and step dad the finger. (im VERY respectful, wouldnt even THINK about doing something like that). i knew i was doing it but I was so fucked up it felt ok. I then tried to get up and leave the hospital and my step dad had to get me, and then hold me down in the bed to keep me from trying to leave again. Then I remembered a nurse coming to me trying to get me to pee in a urinal, and I thought she was trying to play me or fuck me up so i kept saying no. I also remember thinking that i was in the hospital for YEARS and this random girl that I knew from school became a nurse and was trying to act like it wasnt really her. (Call her D). The nurse asked me some question, and i said no, D,!!! In a way as if I just blew her cover. She laughed and said ""Im not D, im some complicated shit."" and showed me her name tag and I was blown away in disbelief. 

After that I started to come back to reality slowly, thank GOD! We didnt stay long enough to find out what the drug actually was. But whatever that shit was, it was DEFINITELY not acid, found out its some ""street drug called candy,"" im not sure what it actually is though. I took real acid plenty of times after, (LOL) and nothing came even CLOSE to how that shit had me!!

I have been taking 40 mg Fluoxetine and Omeprazole 20 mg per day for around 3 months. The problem is I sometime have a little Oxy binge (Which I plan for later today) The thing I've noticed (Could be imagination - but not tolerance as I rarely use Oxy and I haven't any used Opiates for a while)

The buzz is diminished/somewhat lacking.

I thought I noticed this before when I was on Fluoxetine?? As far as i understand Fluoxetine and Omeprazole are cyp2d6 inhibitors. I'm guessing this has something to do with it.. Although a lot of the literature says if anything it should increase the Oxy/buzz.

From what I have read, CYP3A4 has a far bigger impact on the metabolisation of Oxycodone in to the major active metabolite... Although CYP2D6 does play a smaller role.. mainly metabolisiing it to an inactive/less important/active compound..

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks back I took 240 mg and drank 1 litre white grapefruit  a couple of hours before Oxy and hardly felt a thing???? :( I don't want to wasted them again... I have many CYP3A4 Indcuers (Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Sodium Valproate (Valproic Acid) etc...

Would taking any of these CYP3A4 inducers have any impact today? Also what/if any CYP2D6 inhibitors/inducers could help matters?

Chose to work on it instead of going to college. He has (extensively) talked about how the only real point in going to college is to pile on huge debt to get a degree, only to go work for someone else. He'd rather work for himself and be independent than punch a clock and work for someone else. And for a while he was successful, earning an average of $3000/month. Part-time, working from home, all while living at home to save money. He is still living at home by the way.

&amp;#x200B;

He's been smoking weed this whole time, and part of the reason he chose to work for himself is because he can get high and still work. I wasn't in favor of the drug use but I didn't fight it either. He's been smoking since 16.

&amp;#x200B;

Well at one point something clicked, he saved up $70,000 (at 21, pretty impressive). That was a few months ago, and since then a desire to get high, go to parties, and be a ""baller"" overcame his desire to work. He started missing phone calls, blowing off projects, getting chargebacks from clients, and getting multiple complaints about his company posted on the Internet. At this point he ran his business completely into the ground. He no longer gets any calls.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time he, for some reason, upgraded his perfectly good Honda Accord to a brand-new Mercedes costing $30,000. I kept trying to talk him out of it, he had a GOOD WORKING CAR. But he didn't listen! He wants to be a baller!

&amp;#x200B;

At this time he's still partying, he's still balling, he's still getting high, he's down to about $30,000 savings, he has zero income, and he still thinks he's rich.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes he knows web design, but he has absolutely no idea just how much harder life is working for someone else than for yourself. He won't be able to get a ""real job"" as a web designer even with his skills and experience. First, all employers require some kind of degree which he does not have. Also, all employers require specialized skills and have you build websites much more complicated than anything he ever built. He mostly build simple WordPress websites himself and outsourced the more complicated stuff overseas.

&amp;#x200B;

He would charge $500 for a WordPress website that took him a few hours to build, over $100/hour for simple work. He has no idea how good he had it, no idea just how hard real jobs are and how little they pay, he spends money like there's no tomorrow because he thinks money is incredibly easy to earn.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm begging him to stop wasting money IMMEDIATELY. He can keep the car, no use trading it in for a huge loss. But he's unemployed in the middle of a depression with only $30,000 savings! Without an income, not working on a degree, with gaps on the resume, and no real job prospects. He STILL thinks he's a baller!

&amp;#x200B;

My advice for him is to limit himself to a 10mg THC edible per day, 20mg on weekends. No more. And use his remaining money to start a business similar to the one he ran into the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

It basically fell in his lap the first time. The second time won't be easy but will still be possible, IF HE DOESN'T WASTE ALL HIS MONEY because marketing is expensive and he knows it!

&amp;#x200B;

His justification is, I'll party a little longer then I'll get back to work, which is how almost everyone who's blown all their money thinks. Starting this again will not be possible if he's down to zero savings, he will have to work a boring job just to get by. Even if he has a few thousand left it will still be hard and will largely be a gamble.

&amp;#x200B;

He still has enough money to get back in the World, have a career, and live a good life. Pretty soon he won't.

It is a lesser known fact—maybe even completely unknown—that Taos, at one point, had a den of vampires. Not the immortal blood sucking kind, but all the same, it was a den of vampires in a house that sat on a particularly green plot of land on Upper Ranchitos past Carabajal. And the house that was there rested under beautiful tall trees, a sort of oasis or place of repose in the shade when the summer rolled around. Had a mazelike quality, for it was obviously nothing more than the living room and bedroom and kitchen originally, but over the years, the old whitehaired woman who owned it had addition after addition built onto it and connected these extra rooms with small doors you had to stoop under or long windowed hallways. There were piles of junk and old smoke colored tree limbs on the property in piles, but unlike the mesa or other places in Taos, the rubbish there was charming. Things like old white bathtubs and the ornate carved backs of benches and antique wooden planks and wrought iron fencing or stone gargoyles stuck up out of the tall grass when I made my sweaty trek over there from the plaza or Walmart in the summertime.

My first visit to the place happened one night after washing dishes at Ogelvie’s. This was in October, and these two local junkies I knew waited outside of my work. Ran up on me in the dark parking lot behind Bent Street and asked me to take them. Now, I hadn’t done any heroin in Taos as of yet, but I’d met them for a bag of cocaine once or twice, and I’m not sure that I did any that night, either, but that’s how I began to know the place. Heroin was sold there. 

The old lady had something like eight or so dudes—all of them in their early 30s or late 20s—living there. They had taken to boarding in the cool rooms behind the house or turned random benches in the odd corners into beds where they laid around like old Chinese men in black and white pictures of opium dens. None of them paid rent. They exploited the owner’s senility. Her mind was declining with her age, and things got goofy, but she had money. So, they’d come up with some stupid chore to do and convince her to pay them way too much for doing it. Most of the time, they’d never do it and she’d forget and pay them to do it, again. In this way, they were vampires, a den of them. 

And one time she shot both of her Great Danes in the head with her pistol. There was no good reason for it that anyone could see. Just her mind deteriorating. She paid some of the boys 60 bucks to bury them or cremate them. But I’m pretty sure, they dumped them somewhere in the desert and gave her two jars of ashes from the fire pit in the front yard to put up on the mantel. 

Two of the young men who lived there were in a struggle for power. One (We’ll call him Blondie, because I don’t really remember his name and wouldn’t give it to you even if I did.) had long blond hair and lived in his own Fifth Wheel on the side and front of the property up by the road. He was known for dealing heroin out of it, until he shorted Diablo, couldn’t come up with the money and got trounced for it. Another thing we knew him for was his picking. He’d do this strange form of aerobics, bounce and sweat in the mirror of his Fifth Wheel after he got high. Wrapped a towel around his wrist and used his fingers to dig imaginary fibers he called staph out of his skin, until there was nothing but a giant black scab where his forehead used to be. Once he’d moved on and he was having to bum around town on people’s couches, other junkies would take the lightbulbs out of the bathroom to keep him from doing it.  

Blondie’s political enemy on the compound (Whom we’ll call Dufus, because why not?) shared the old lady’s bed, though it’s not clear what the nature of their relationship was. He sold for Diablo sometimes. Other times, he had Smokey and Des’s blacker gooier stuff in a big chunk at the round kitchen table and a scale in front of him. His hair was long. And he had a brother who wasn’t quite right, had to be led around this way and that way, had to be told to stop mindlessly repeating whatever random word he’d heard in someone else’s conversation. Dufus made candles for a living, before he started selling dope out of the old lady’s house.

The rest of them crept around in the dark. Never spoke as far as I can remember. And let Dufus and Blondie bicker over this or that, to vie for the attention and ultimately control of the old lady through their ruthless manipulations. They were the guys in town, at least when I first started doing heroin, again, unless you knew Smokey and Des. Because Diablo didn’t mess with the masses. He always chose one guy at a time and fronted him prepackaged bags of the stuff to sell, until they messed up his money and he’d beat them up. But Smokey and Des would come meet up with you anywhere south of the El Prado Post Office and north of Taco Bell, as long as you had their number and called between eight a.m. and six in the evening. 

Everyone in the heroin community met there at one point or another, so that everyone in Taos who did dope knew everyone else who did it, too. Wendy slept in one of the back beds her first winter in town—this was before Bo came—and made kettle corn on the stove for Dufus in the afternoons. And that’s where I first met Harold, Miss Ninny’s husband or boyfriend or whatever. He had come to pick up from Dufus, and we all stood around in the living room there. A tiny, black haired girl waited next to Harold in her plaid school uniform. She had one foot on the ground and the other one moving up and down along the inside of her opposite leg, like she was nervous. He said she was his daughter, even though she was Miss Ninny’s daughter, and I guessed her age. I said maybe 10, but probably 11. Harold and the girl smiled, because it was so. 

And while we talked, I found out he and I were from the same part of the country. He was born in Port Orchard and handled snakes while he grew up out there and had firm beliefs about the superiority of white people over all the other races, citing differences in sebaceous glands and some other things I can’t remember to prove the point. How that worked? I wasn’t sure, but Harold went on like no one wouldn’t agree. All the while, the little girl clung to the armchair next to him and looked up from his hip and took it all in through those big black pupils.  

And I saw him around sometimes, like the time he was down at AutoZone with Miss Ninny in the summer. They’d walked all the way up from Talpa, because their metallic forest green Trailblazer had broken down. She was asking him for a cigarette, one she’d almost certainly purchased but which he guarded and doled out to her at his discretion, and looked completely out of place. Miss Ninny was sweating and desperate and frail, intrinsically feeble in a way that we were not. Looked to be 40ish. Had long skinny appendages that stuck out of her sagging torso and squatty palms with long slender fingers and bulbous tips like a tree frog’s hands. Her shape and skin were too soft and rich southern accent too perfect to be there waiting for Bo to show up like the rest of us, much less to have walked there. It embarrassed me to see her, not that I knew Miss Ninny then. It would be a long time, before our paths crossed and we spent any significant time together.

In the meantime, back at the vampire’s den, things changed. Snow fell. Snow melted. Birds sang in the trees. Bonfires burned in the back yard, and soon, Dufus and his brother left in the middle of the night. Nobody heard they were leaving, and no one knew where they went. Blondie became the prime minister of the property. Earned enmity with the old lady’s son, although it’s not clear that the son’s motives were any less self-serving than Blondie’s. Her son wanted the property and made it plain, and eventually, Blondie lost his place and power there, too. The old lady had his Fifth Wheel smashed with sledgehammers and towed out to the nether reaches of Questa or wherever. He could be seen around town leeching off of this pretty middle-aged red head and driving her Nissan Xterra. The black oozing sore that was his forehead never went away. It only changed shape and grew up past his hairline. And pretty soon, Bo and Wendy took over working for Diablo. Some months after that, they moved into one of the back rooms together. By then, all the rest of the vampires had left.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,689225,public,confidence,self,all the same,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hg1ush/all_the_same/,,no_ads,0.0,1593178601.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I didn’t touch them until a week later. Then it started to be a routine. I kept coming back to the caffeine mixed with the ibuprofen. Flash forward to today.

Hi, I'm not a drug user currently, although that's more a lack of circumstance rather than a lack of willing. However if I were to start using drugs it'd basically only be for expanding my art. However I make scary stuff, and don't exactly wanna waste my time with bright and happy hippie shit.  


Not saying there's anything wrong with it; it's just not my style.  


Is there a way I could potentially force a bad trip and expand my experiences/references?   


I heard Datura was an easy way to get a bad trip but it seems to last way longer and be way more toxic to the body than I'm willing to risk. I just wanna see spooky shit, not end up in a psyche ward ya know?

A week ago, I was at my friends house and decided to take N2O for the first time. As someone who is not very experienced with drugs, this was a pretty big deal. (I took 2,5g of shrooms once and smoked weed a bunch of times.) My friend took it before me so I could see what it looked like being on N2O. After I finished my joint I decided to wait for a little before taking it. While smoking, he explained to me what and how am I going to feel. He told me that he prefers to lay on bed and have his eyes closed, so I did it like him as well. I closed my eyes and started inhaling sweet N2O. As i was inhaling, my friends voice started to slowly fade away, all I could hear was a loud static noise similar to one between two radio channels. All of a sudden I had a strange feeling like I was falling asleep while still being self- conscious, kind of... All I could see was a static looking spiral, like the one they use in cartoons for fake hynosis. At that point I could not feel my entire body. It felt like I'm lrly dying, like I decided to press pause in life and give myself two options: to die or keep living. It felt like a dream, while still being kind of conscious, but not having any toughts like I usually have in my head while actually being alive. Anyway, I have ""chosen"" the 2nd option. I opened my eyes while lauhging like a total idiot. I could not remember the moment I stoped inhaling and start laughing while touching my eyebrow and stomack, because it felt super weird.

Dry heaving when you brush your teeth in the morning. Muscles ache, bones throb, nerves on fire, limbs kicking; the pain and restlessness seem unreal. If lucky, you're sleeping for 15 minutes at a time in a drenched bed sheet that isn't going to get washed anytime soon.  You wake up from your 3rd wet dream of the week, only to be bombarded with instant anxiety and the realization that your in hell on earth. Time moves so slow. Nothing is interesting. Even watching YouTube feels like a chore. Conversations feel so awkward, and all you want to be is alone, yet you crave attachment. Most likely you haven't had a gf/bf for an embarrassing amount of time. Nothing matters. Life seems dull and grey. And the only remedy is what got you here in the first place.  

You somehow power through the days. Physically you feel a little better, but mentally still falling in an abyss. When will you reach the ocean floor? Your missed calls/texts are adding up, yet still no desire to enter back in reality. You tell loved ones you have the flu... The 4th time this year. They know whats up. But you don't have the energy to come clean and validate their disappointment.  But you keep pushing through. You lay in bed, catching yourself praying to a God that you don't even believe in. You are so close to relapse because there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. Life seems so dark. Will you ever feel normal again? 

You wake up to the birds chirping, glance at your phone, and surprised it's 7am. You finally take a dump that has an actual shape. Somehow you're able to eat a bowl of cereal. You hop in the shower and stand the entire time, instead of periodically sitting like a school kid as the water temporary cleanses your soul like a baptism.  As you're drying off, the shivering shakes aren't as prevalent. You find the energy to go to the store. When you approach the cashier, you make friendly eye contact and surprisingly it doesn't feel like she stared through your soul. The small talk doesn't seem as forced and your brain reacts a little faster. Possibly even make a corny joke that gets a smile. As you walk back to your car, you notice you're walking a little faster. Muscles aren't aching as bad. Lower back not tied in a knot. The sky looks bluer and the trees a little greener. The gentle breeze dries the sweat off your back, and for once you're content with your body temperature. 

THAT FEELING WHEN the sun shines down on your pale face.. You look up and smile for the first time in a week+. You begin to float up from the ocean floor; equilibrium is in motion, and that radiant light at the end of the tunnel is now visible. The hard part is over, yet deep down you know it has just begun. But for the time being you have hope. That smile on your face is worth more than money can buy and perhaps your bank account has seen the last of overdraft days. As you drive down the road, with windows down, a nostalgic song comes on the radio, and it's like you've heard music for the first time..

That feeling when you are finally recovering from opiate withdrawal..

I've been able to connect the dots as of recently and it turns out I get irrationally anxious, paranoid and quite awkward without sleep and perhaps there is a degree of overthinking to that, but I feel as if I pick up on myself being awkward in interactions, then others will as well. Because of the sheer absurd irrationallity of how my mind behaves under 0 hours of sleep and the prospect of that thought, the irrational thinking would spiral into a negative inward feedback loop of negative thoughts that would pervade any social interaction I have, at least until I try to slink out of it as politely and subtly as possible. You feel as if people are slightly more hostile towards you or have ill intent. You worry a lot more than you normally should, you feel weaker physically and feel less coordinated. You remember less.

All of these effects seem to scale higher the less hours of sleep I get. Come to find out the hard way over my life, but sleep is important and you genuinely need in my opinion regardless of what human you are, at least 7 or more hours a night. It makes your mind and body much more resiliant and to be honest, I'm not me if I don't get enough sleep.

As the title says: Today, after I have thought about it for... probably years, I finally did it and made an appointment with a psychotherapist for a first meeting. 

I am 29 years old and have done drugs for close to half my lifetime now. Weed almost daily, but also everything else more or less regularly. For a long time I thought I had no problem, then I though my addiction was my problem, but lately I've come to terms with the realization that it just more complicated. This came though a lot of thinking, some of it while under the influence (dissos were helping me), some of it while dreadfully sober.

Without writing too much about my mental issues, I think that I have some. I started doing drugs when I was young and had a hard time, so I seriously damaged my ability to cope with emotions, anxiety and so on. I don't want to say ""Drugs are bad, it's their fault"", because that is not true. I had great experiences with drugs and I still want to have them in the future.

But I can't and don't want to suppress everything that's unpleasant. I don't want to put myself in these fucking chains anymore. I don't know if it will help, or if I'll quit again. But I have nothing to loose, or at least I have much more to loose if I keep on ignoring my problems.

Now, why do I post this? I don't know, really. Probably in part because I am glad that I finally did this and just wanted to share. But also because hearing of people that did the same step has helped me in overcome in some of the worries of it. 

Maybe some of you have similar stories?

They seem to work on the A2 receptor, Mirt blocks, Guanfacine stimulates, yet both are supposed to promote relaxation. How does that work? 

Guanfacine is approved for ADD in part because stimulanting to A2 is supposed to help executive function... Mirt on that basis would seem to be bad for ADD because it blunts that action.

Pharmacist said, maybe they canx eachother out at that receptor so you at least don't get a block, but also may not get the mirt benefits. A low dose of mirt 15mg at night and a stiff dose of guanfacine (2-3mg) in the AM may get to the desired effect.

Well if you have there is a high chance the substance is trying to convey a message to you that you just arent seeing, and that is nothing can entertain you like how you can entertain yourself. I believe it is all about your dose (200 micrograms), and what you truly want to learn and dig up about yourself.Its not about just getting high it could be productive and profound. Generally when people talk about taking LSD they talk about set and setting. Yes this is a important part of having a pleasant experience, but it is only the first step. More importantly dont obsessed over the fact that you have taken a substance. Consciously you are going to be asking yourself questions like when is this going to kick in, or how much time has passed, or how is this LSD going to make me feel good or bad? But you mustn't let the substance manifest in your conscience , because you are not being your normal calm self. You are being irrational about something that hasnt even happened yet let the journey guide you. So the best advice I have for you is to take LSD like you had taken nothing at all (Make sure you are somewhere safe and comfortable). To many people look over the fact of not thinking about certain things while on there trip because it might ""kill your high"" but it wont the journey lives on all your doing to yourself is allowing clouded energy into your mind. You should just let your thoughts flow as they are. It will amplify more of you, because you are being you and your not suppressing any thoughts or emotions. So it rewards you with spiritual epiphanies because you are being yourself and someone your not. The substance cant tell you truths about yourself if you arent being true to yourself by being you. It's like trying to understand a whole book without even opening it. Useful tips I've found to help you feel more you and be more of you (your origional energy) is to play a instrument, draw or paint, listen to music and dance a little bit, or just a peaceful walk to see all the beauty of the world. So what if you dont know how to play a guitar? Set those fingers on and pluck your soul out of those strings! So what if your not good at art? You'll never know what it will look like unless you try! What if you don't know how to dance or sing? Well stand up shuffle those feet around an move them hips and find your own rhythm!!! Your scared to go for a walk because you are paranoid of the outside world? Just be you! Believe in yourself becasue theres no better day in age to start trying than right now in this time. These are all the activities I have found that are very soul finding and theres many more I haven't discovered. Metarlistic objects can never make you feel as good as how you can make yourself feel good such as cool lights, cell phones, Television, money, aimless sex, cars ounce you conquer yourself and discipline your mind to lower the illusion clouding your mind; then you will learn to love yourself for who you truly are, because you took your ego out of guard mode and into flow mode. You tore down all the walls and conquered the beautiful land within you; that is when the LSD will truly reward you because you saw through the illusion. Think of it as the LSD is way more fascinated with us than we are of it we have much potential. People will say easier said than done, but in reality it's easier done than said. Quit making excuses for yourself your wasting more energy saying you can't do it than actually doing it. Just cut loose those strings and let go change is good. One more piece of advice that I found within myself that u think has a universal truth for everyone. 

I'm so thoughtful I seem to forget
So forgetfulness will bring thoughtfulness

I hope this seems to help you even a little bit 

Priceless love, and have a splendid trip

So we decided to wait a month to try again. I talked to my doctor about going off my meds for a while and they were okay with it. So last Saturday I went to his place and we did 100mg each to start (we had a second dose later on) and while I was able to feel it much more intensely this time, I didnt feel completely euphoric like I expected.

My job also ""never"" drug tests me....until they did the very next Tuesday. I am 5'9 140 pounds of bones and again i dont ever smoke just wanted to join and try to have a good night. Once i learned that morning, i delayed goin in to take it because i was busy downing a shit ton of water. I probably drank over half a gallon and peed 3 times before my actual test. My urine was crystal clear. Dont know if this helps but sunday the day after i smoked, i went on a 7mile hike and sweated alot. With all these factors, do you think i did enough to dilute the test. What do you think my chamces are of passing? And yes i know i shouldnt have done and if im caught then ill accept full responsibility for my actions. Just curious on the situation.

I live in a town where there are lots of condominiums. As soon as they went asleep, i went to my friend’s place and immediately made plans.

We popped 1 red jurassic half each, waited for the come up, my friend was getting anxious and had to throw up in the toilet in his condo, he was also kind of getting paranoid and sweaty, i was mostly chill even though it was my first time, i had a positive mindset going in. Fast forward, 2 hrs in we were in the balcony laying down listening to the winds, they sounded freakin BEAUTIFUL, i felt love and empathy and just felt close and felt like talking was a beautiful thing. We did listen to nature and did some music. After awhile, we figured we had 2 sheets of acid so we tripped on one each hahaha and we went down to our source (who lives in the same condo btw) to buy 2 more tabs and just redose 1 each. Here’s when we became shocked:

The ecstasy we were buying was MDMA mixed with meth, and as soon as our source said that we literally just got hyped af and worked out in the condo once we got back. Was LITERALLY CARRYINg 20kg’s of dumbbell here and there me and my friend hahahah. We were so hyped af we were really feeling powerful and top of the world, but at the same time the trippy visuals was there too 😂 on top of all that, i made sure me and him were drinking water every 30-45 mins, massaging each other and just about meditating and laughing our ass off at the same time 😂 And then we had a good ass blunt sesh to end the day. Thats’s about it.

When i got home my brother asked me why i looked like a zombie and I said i just took a hash oil lmao

I already had been smoking weed years prior but a trend that picked up in my school between the edgy kids was pills. Didnt matter what they were, someone would steal a handful of their relatives pills and go to school the next day selling like 5 for $20 and i was apart of this trend. I wasnt over doing it like the other kids, i’d buy adderall just because i had sleep insomnia and i was exhausted during the school day. So monday at school id buy the 5 pills and id have one every day to kick start the school day along with coffee. And that went on for a while until my friend told me he had stolen some zoloft from his dad and he offered it to me and i was alright with it because he had taken a few at lunch already and it was about an hour until i got on the bus to go home but instead of the normal 5 for 20 he needed to get rid of them so he gave me 15 pills for $30. I had never tried anything outside of weed and adderall. So me going home with it in my bag and not trying it and going to school with it in my bag wasnt a very bright idea because come the next day i dont know what i was thinking but my first class of the day i pop 2 and waited like 10 minutes then took 3 more and then 20 mins later i took 5 more and i dont know what motivated me to pop them like that but again it wasnt a very bright idea. I had take 10 of 15 zoloft and about 20 minutes after it all hit me at once. I also forgot to mention that during the time i wasnt mentally stable, such as starving myself and going through suicidal phases along with some of my friends stopping and joking to me about how i seemed sociopathic. So i had 10 anti deppresants in my stomach with nothing else i hadnt eaten in 4 days and i was dehydrated. And when it did hit me i felt like puking but i had nothing to puke up. And when it was all hitting me at once i was in my history class and i asked to go to the bathroom and for 20 mins i tried to puke. The finger in fhe throat method did nothing for me because  my throat had gone completely numb from one of the pills just stuck to the back of it and so i just considered myself screwed so i went back to class feeling cross eyed and ready to pass out. And i went ahead and layed my head on a table at the front of the class next to the teachers desk and i ended up passing out for like 10 minutes and i woke up and i gagged from a disgusting smell i think my nose went sensetive or something. And all i saw was the floor like i dont know how to say other than it was breathing and it kind of looked like when han solo puts the mellenium falcon in hyper speed or whatever it is but instead of the white from stars it was a tan color because of the floor tile i was starring at then after almost puking and feeling like a wet noodle next to my history teacher i then pass out again but for 2 hours and all i can remeber is dreming i was falling off a building but everytime i was close to hitting fhe ground id blink and i would be falling off the building again and that happened over and over again like 20-30 times then when i woke up after the two hours i looked up and saw everyone was at lunch and it was just my teacher in the room with me with one of those special needs helper teacher people in the back and as i look up my history teacher asks if im ok and i said i have no idea and passed out for another hour and woke up to my step dad next to me with ghe nurse and 2 of my teachers waking me up and asking if im alright and i said some stupid shit like. “I think i have the stomach bug or something ive been feeling like this since yesterday” and then they ended up helping me up and my step dad brought me home and i went into my room and told this story to my best friend and after that i was still feeling dizzy and i just said fuck it and  sat in my bathroom for 20 minutes drinking faucet water and i eventually ended up puking the water up and what ever remnents of pills that was somehow left and i went to sleep and went to school the next day and continued life. But the one thing that ive always thought about since that day,im convinced i overdosed  but my body some how over came it and here i am years later glad something major didnt come out of that or any experiments i tried over the years. Life also managed to turn around and i managed to over come my nicotine addiction and i strictly only smoke weed now i havent swallowed pills in 3 years as of a month ago.

I also was able to realize that I have a lot of nervous tics in my behaviour due to anxiety and I felt myself releasing the anxious energy that was causing these tics. I realized just how much my anxiety affects my everyday life and I felt myself gaining the power to control it.

Ritalin is too expensive here and Adderall isn't available. 

It's been helping a great deal, I've been very productive. I manage to take days off now and again to try to maintain tolerance. I weigh out 30-40mg doses to take 2-4 times a day. 

The only negative side effect is that after a few days of taking it orally, my stomach gets very sore, the kind of sore you get if you spend a week eating curries, smoking and drinking espresso. I've always had stomach acid problems, and I'm on stomach acid suppressants anyway. 

I know cocaine can cause gastritis, I didn't think amphetamines would, because they're given orally as adderall? Could it be the raw powder itself is harsh on the stomach lining?

I've gone and bought some acid resistant capsules which I've started putting the speed in, with the idea that the speed bypasses my stomach and gets released by the capsule into the small intestine, but it's too early to say if they're helping.

Has anyone else doing small doses of speed daily had this problem? Should I consider rectal administration? 😩

We ask that folks not complete the first survey unless they expect to complete the second, as the study relies on both. Participation is confidential and voluntary.\n\n**Eligibility:** 18+, living in the US, have considered suicide in the past year, and would consider yourself to be in one of the following groups: (1) using alcohol has been giving you problems in the past year or (2) using opiates has been giving you problems in the past year. The first couple minutes is a screener to confirm eligibility.\n\n**Survey Link:** Please send me a DM or chat message with your email for a personal link. The link will hold your place if you pause and resume over 7 days. All inquiries will be kept strictly confidential.\n\n**Study Goal:** In brief, the ultimate goal of the study is to develop better interventions for folks who may be considering suicide. The specific goal is to determine what different treatment needs may exist between folks using opiates, using alcohol, or not using substances. *To this end, we ask for detailed information on alcohol/substance use and suicide as this provides the clearest information on if/how they are related and what treatment needs exist.*\n\n**Questions?**: If you have any questions, or accidentally click on something that takes you out of the survey prematurely, please send me a DM, reply to this thread, or email me directly: [Utoledostudy@gmail.com](mailto:Utoledostudy@gmail.com).

TL:DR at the bottom. The last three or four paragraphs sum everything up really well I think. But I'm not an author so don't hate me. My thoughts sometimes string in strange ways and I may often ramble. As evident by this fucking essay I've written. But please Enjoy and give me your feedback. 

Just some background before I begin. Before this trip my drug experience was I had: shrooms 4 times (at increasing dose each time from 1g and the last one was 3g), I took acid one other time (250ug), and one time with MDMA (300mg). I have never had anything close to a bad trip. In fact I couldn't even comprehend how these substances could be bad unless I took an insanely high dose (Boy would I learn a thing or two about that thought later). So I'm not some kind of veteran but I know what to expect.

I decided on June 6th that I was going to trip on acid for the second time the next day (June 7th) so I posted online asking if I should up my dose. Only one guy responded and he said that based on the effects of my first experience  I probably didn't have tabs that were actually 250ug and they were more like 100ug each. He said taking two would be best. Of course I stupidly took his advice because I wanted the next level of the experience.. So I set aside two of my gel tabs for sunday night and went to bed all excited.

So I dropped the acid at 7pm and was all excited. I wasn't in any interesting place just solo tripping in my parents basement (I'm home from college due to covid). I planned on eating some fruit, drawing, listening to music, and playing some games with friends. I fasted for 24 hours before to make sure it hit me good and fast. I was hoping for stronger euphoria and visuals. I don't know if it matters but it was also very hot out. Like 95 degrees fahrenheit.

Also before I begin I have to say there is no way I can truly capture or explain the feeling I had during the experience. I can't do justice the fear, feeling, relief, or the visual or auditory hallucinations. I'll try but I can't do it the best. I'll try my best.

T-0 So at 7pm I took two Gel tabs at 500ug total. I was excited and in a great mood

T-20 I started feeling the first effects. Felt tingly and excited could tell it was hitting was faster than usual and thought it was the result of the 24 hour fast. A few minutes later I went to take a shit. Shitting while tripping felt so weird. It was a process all on it's own. My dad came downstairs to do laundry while I was pooping. I was able to talk to him normally here as it was just starting to hit. He would need to come back down to take the clothes out when it finished, which would be like an hour later.

T-60 I could tell the effects were way stronger than anything I'd ever experienced or expected. I saw the ground change colors. It's a white carpet and it looked orange and yellow. My mind was racing and I couldn't focus on one thought completely before another one popped in my head. I kept recording snapchat videos of the trip to document it so I could see what it was like later. While recording I felt like I was floating outside my body. I knew this was going to be a bad trip at that moment. At 8:20 was the first time I felt like I wasn't a person but it wasn't an intense feeling as it would be later. At this point I wanted the trip to end. 

T- 80 I knew my dad would be coming down soon. I was full on zoinked out of my mind at this point and could no way have a conversation with him. I thought I should run upstairs and go to my room but I always go to bed really late and there is no way that he wouldn't check on me in my room. In hindsight I should have gone in my room. I paced back in forth in fear that he would catch me and think differently about me. and we would have to have the ""drug conversation"". My Mom definitely thinks acid can kill you so I was not trying to have this convo. I was also ashamed of myself for doing drugs. I was seeing all these crazy visuals, I can't really describe them accurately to give it justice. I know when I closed my eyes I saw all sorts of familiar images from my life and I felt my eyes twitching under my eyelids. I saw all sorts of bright zig zagging patterns moving back and forth. The closed eyes visuals were really cool but I was so worked up I couldn't enjoy them. It was like I was transported into a cartoon rainbowland. My mind was moving so fast I couldn't focus on all my thoughts. I was questioning my entire existence. I've been trying a lot of drugs recently and that is not something I've done in the past. I felt ashamed at the person I've become. I guess I was ashamed I didn't live up to my full potential and had recently let stuff slip by. 

T-120 As I was awaiting my dad coming down and catching me I began to completely freak out and lose my mind. Any profound thinking ended and my brain and body went into survival mode. I would have continuous thought or action loops. Where I would think the same things which would lead to a new thought and I would keep going in this never ending loop of continuous thoughts. I also kept walking to the laundry room, look at the time left on the washer, run back to the tv, look at it, go to the window and look out it and then start over and repeat. I kept saying ""I'm not even In my body right now"" I was completely out of it. I sat down and grabbed my ankles and tried to shake myself out of it and get a grip. I felt like everything around me was floating my body included. I started seeing the room spin.  When you take other drugs your headspace changes and you feel different. On this acid trip my headspace changed but it was more like my mind left my body and I was just watching what was happening rather than experiencing it. Like I somehow took this acid and could see something that wasn't there. It felt like I entered another plan of existence. Around this time is when I think the auditory hallucinations began. I heard the sounds of my screen door opening and shutting, cop car sirens, bird chirping, the normal vibration pattern an iphone has when you get a call on silent, the alarm clock sound I use, some meme video I saw where a girl made weird noises and I kept hearing those noises she made and I also heard my dad saying my name. These sounds were continuously being looped in my head. The intensity, loudness, speed, and frequency would change but some amount of these sounds would be with me for the next eight or so hours. It's possible some of these sounds I actually heard in real life but for sure was hearing them later when they weren't there because it was way later into the night. At this point I also kept hearing my dad move around upstairs and the AC unit was finally turned on. Those sounds would always freak me out. I thought he was coming downstairs about five different times but they were all false alarms and was just me tweaking. Even though the AC was on I was still sweating. I looked back at one of the videos I took and I'm drenched. I sat down in the rocking chair and ""gave in"" to the experience. Not that I wasn't already but I guess I accepted my fate. If my dad wasn't going to come down and I was alone I think I could have just sat back and relaxed and let it play out, but i had to be alert and more anxious because of him coming down. So I tried just to calm down as I awaited the inevitable. 

T-180 About three hours in and My dad opened the door and I snapped out of ""giving into the experience"", When he came down I panicked so much. The room spun around like crazy. The best way to describe it is everything I saw was rotating in some kind of overlapping daze, I knew I had to do something otherwise he would know something was up.  He would find out I was high when I didn't even know who I was. So I instantly got off the couch and ran into the bathroom. This bathroom would become the setting for the complete dissolution of my ego and who I thought I was.  My dad walked by and moved the laundry to the dryer. I kept thinking about going out and talking to  him. I felt the urge to hug him, I needed comfort, something my family doesn't always provide especially emotionally. My dad, and mom, should be there to help me but in this instance my dad seeing me was the worst case and in a way he was the one that was causing my discomfort. Funny how that works. Anyway he went out in the other room to wait for it to finish. My dogs came down and I heard him walking and moving all around. I had to just sit in the bathroom and pretend to poop.I wonder what he thought was going on. I just walked right past him when he got in the basement and hid in the bathroom. Just a little strange. I have no recollection of talking to him so I'm assuming it went well. Anyway he went up about ten minutes later but I couldn't tell for sure so I stayed in the bathroom. I got by without him finding out I was tripping. I was relieved but I was peaking so it was like out of the frying pan and into the fire type of deal. 

T-220 So I'm on the toilet and I have this crazy feeling of not knowing who I am or what is me. The auditory hallucinations were so intense during this time. I heard the above mentioned sounds and I heard my mom crying and yelling for help, I heard my dad and mom saying my name and it sounded like something happened to my dad. Gave me visions of him drowning or having a heart attack. I realized I won't always have him around. I tried to expunge this thought from my mind as fast as possible. These auditory hallucinations became so intense that it felt so real. I think that was the worst part, I couldn't think right and it gave me this horrible feeling of discomfort which was only amplified by the dissolution of my ego. During the trip I texted a guy on reddit all my thoughts. I used his dm as a notepad for my thoughts.  I guess I felt like that he was my companion or something.  I kept feeling like I wasn't in my body and I didn't know who I was. I was scared that things might not go back to normal. I was trying to tell myself that I was just tripping and things will get better it's all going to end. However I had no concept of what things would go back to. I tried thinking back at old memories and it just felt like they didn't exist. Everything I thought was seen through the lense of tripping and the lense of not being in my body. I knew I was tripping but I didn't know who the I was. It feels like my spirit was half way between death and life. Like I had died but my physically body was still there and I was simply watching what happened. I'm almost certain this is where it got so intense I passed out. 

T-330 About five and a half hours in and I remember coming to a little bit. I got off the toilet for the first time in three hours or so. I stared into the mirror a little bit and relearned how my legs worked. It felt like I was reborn and now had to relearn how the world works. I was so stuck in my own world while tripping that it became the new normal. After I regrouped I left the bathroom and it was so weird going back into the room where I was previously freaking out and losing touch with reality. The auditory hallucination were mostly over and I thought I was sober. I even said that to the guy I was messaging. It turns out I was not and was still tripping. I saw things differently than they were. Like my laptop looked like a trapezoid not a rectangle, or it felt like somethings were bigger than normal like my phone, I also felt taller yet with shorter legs. It was a weird headspace. 

T-360-end I went upstairs to my room. Every bit of noise I made felt way louder in my head. I laid down and was so restless. Again I thought I was close to baseline. The auditory hallucinations came back, and I had crazy visuals when I closed my eyes. I saw all sorts of light flashing and patterns rotating and bouncing all around. I also began to sweat a ton again. I got up and went to pee after about 45 minutes of laying there hearing and seeing shit. I peed for about two minutes and it felt like all evil spirits that haunted me on my journey had left through my urethra. Almost in a flash I came to. I had no idea where i was. It felt like getting up and going to pee was a dream and it didn't really happen. I went back to my room and went on my phone or laid there for about four hours as I calmed down and processed what just happened. I had my contacts in and couldn't get them out and my eyes hurt so bad. I was too tired to move so I feel asleep with them in. I finally went to sleep at around 8:00am around 13 hours after I dropped the acid.

So It was quite the experience. I think being out of it has made me appreciate it and think it's kinda cool experience. I learned a lot tbh. I think on acid you see the beauty in everything even the simplest things. This view on life can be applied to normal life as well. I think it can bring a significant amount of joy, just taking things in a positive way and seeing the best parts of things, people, or situations.Throughout the trip I kept thinking I was a failure because of my school work was slipping and I was taking drugs. But really my life is just beginning and I can't be a failure because I've barely attempted anything. I'm going to finish college and lead a good life. I realized that the beauty of life is finding something you love and you care for and then doing that thing. Put everything into that thing because it will be so rewarding for you. Everyone loves saying ""life is short"" yet they don't do anything to act on this thought. They use it as an excuse not a motivation. Instead of using the life you're given to the fullest they are content with mediocrity and use life being too short as a reason they didn't achieve more or didn't follow their dreams. NO! Fuck that! I'm going to chase my dreams. I'm not going to make any excuses for not having a good life I'm going to have a good life. I really have a go with the flow personality but I've also got to sometimes take the world and put my life in my own hands and take charge. I've also learned about the power social media and the internet has on the current world. I've always struggled with validation and the internet can give you instant validation. For instance I'm writing this and posting it on every relatable subreddit to get validation. I guess it's because I want my life to matter and not get lost. I want to leave some kind of impact and legacy. But whenever I have a profound thought I reach for my phone to record it but why? I'm not famous, or rich, or some kind of philosopher. I'm just a kid tripping on drugs in his parents basement and sometimes I wish I could be more. I feel the world is focused on the instant gratification of social media. Something I try to abstain from. Finally I got sad based on wasted potential. I just feel like my life could have been so much better and on the flip side could also get way better. 

The next day everything felt in a weird haze.I felt a little melancholy but mostly happy. I would say somewhere between hangover and afterglow. I almost had PTSD bout going back to my basement. For the first time I was down there all I could think about was the events that took place the night before. Anyway my dad never found out and he didn't seem to be suspicious or anything. He must have thought I had a stomach ache or something. Crazy how things work like that.

I think some combination of stress (that might have been unknown cuz I felt fine to trip), heat, hunger, high dose, etc caused this but idk if all these have effects, I just think they affected my mood/mindset. This acid trip was unexpected but maybe it was needed. It is insane what this drug can make you feel. There is something to be said about underestimating the power of psychedelics.  I think this rug is incredible. It has less of an recreational value and is more about an experience which can sometimes lead to enlightenment depending on your mindset. I realized you could make some crazy art while on this. The way your brain almost expands and moves a mile a minute lead to incredible thoughts. If you can focus on these thoughts you could make great art whether it be music, painting, profound realizations, or whatever. I believe this drug makes you see the world in a bright manner. However sometimes it takes you through a dark place to see this brightness. I think trying to force one of these experiences would result in failure at truly appreciating it to the highest degree because it would feel to forced. Like you were trying to become enlightened or trying to experience ego death. So really me dosing a high dose of 500ug was really a blessing in disguise. I'm very grateful for this trip.

 Next time I take LSD I plan to be outdoors. I don't think this drug has a high recreational value. I will really only take this drug looking for an experience like this one, tripping outside in an awesome place, or maybe if some buddies and I decide to drop together. Also believe it or not I was planning on popping some mdma about 4 hours into this trip but it got so intense I forgot all about it. AnywayY there is so much more I could say but I need to stop cuz this is super long and I've been writing for forever. Thanks everyone for reading. Let me know what you think or if you have any questions. 

TL:DR So basically I got darkweb acid that was 250ug each. Someone told me it wasn't 250 but probably 100 and to take two. I took two which was actually 500ug and not 200ug. Had ego death in my basement while my dad did laundry. I lucked out that he didn't catch me. It was a wild ass trip and I learned a lot.

I never got addicted to anything and recently I've only been microdosing shrooms (which is working absolute miracles for me btw). But in the past I've done benzos, coke, amphetamines, MDMA, and some others pretty regularly. I think I'd just tell myself that ""you're not immune to the pull of addiction and overuse"". Because for some reason, in the middle of taking these substances, I felt immune for some reason. But after stopping and looking back, I can see that I was on a dangerous path. There were definitely things I wish I didn't even try but I don't like to regret things.

Tragically, it’s all too true and very real: I’m an almost 30 year old University of Michigan grad who’s life has been derailed by drug abuse problems and will be decided by a tragedy I had limited control over.

I can’t emphasize enough how much my heart breaks when I think of Jeff’s premature passing–which I do, every day. What makes this so much worse is knowing what a great person he was: intelligent, competitive, a good friend. I don’t know, and hopefully never will, how this terrible tragedy must feel for Jeff’s family. I can only extend my most heartfelt sympathy and compassion; I hope it’s not seen as an empty gesture. Moreover, for the same reason, I try to imagine, if the situation were reversed (as it very well could’ve been, as you’ll see) how easy and tempting it would be to assume the very worst of whomever provided the drugs causing my brother’s fatal overdose. However, the reality of what transpired on April 15, 2018, is much more complicated than the basic facts would suggest, requiring a broader context of our relationship as well as a knowledge of the dynamic of our relationship. I was just another drug user helping out a friend, who also did drugs, and I thought, from one user to the next, I was being as responsible as I possibly could. But as anyone doing heroin knows, doing the drug is like playing a Russian Roulette. Let me explain:

For the most part, I’ve adhered to the golden rule of treating others as I would like to be treated; the best intentions and a general benevolence towards everyone guided my behavior. Despite these principles (or maybe because of them), I’ve spent the past two years in prison, and face the possibility of spending many more within the DOC. My rap sheet reads like an aspiring El Chapo, but I’ve never considered myself a drug dealer, and all of my closest friends find that characterization laugh-out-loud ridiculous. Jeff would probably disagree with that label. Hell, the detective handling this case even related to me his surprise at finding out I was incarcerated for a delivery/manufacture charge, and said that he knew I wasn’t a drug dealer. 99% of the time, if my residence had ever been raided, the only time and place the authorities would’ve found drugs would be the incredibly brief interval between buying the dope and doing it, on a plate or mirror, as it was chopped up and prepped for ingestion. It’s difficult to overstate how anomalous the series of events were leading up to my current predicament–the flukey result of unlikely occurrences and impossible situations recurring and stacking up to form an even more unlikely scenario.

I never really experimented with drugs until I started college. In fact, before then I was adamantly against their use and was never really tempted to try them. My freshman year at U of M started in the semester of fall ’09, but it also commenced my decade under the influence. Like many college students, I binge drank on the weekends, but this soon encroached on the rest of the week. Later, I tried pot and loved it. I set stricter limits to my pot smoking, but they were just as easily transgressed. It progressed from only-on-the-weekends to only-after-work-and-school to maybe-before-this-class to as-soon-as-I-wake-up. However, as a pothead I was still capable of handling my demanding schedule over the next year and a half. During this time, I infrequently used adderall and xanax, experimented with hallucinogens, and snorted cocaine on special occasions. My drinking, at least, declined. Regardless, I worked two jobs and maintained a GPA above 3.5. Everything was copacetic.

However, somewhere along the way I lost myself. I can’t pinpoint the exact moment, but I know at some point I couldn’t function, or believed I couldn’t, without drugs. Initially, I had utilized drugs, particularly adderall, as tools to aid my academic endeavors, a means to an end. But the means soon became the end themselves. My grades suffered. I developed a crippling dependence on benzos; I couldn’t handle the least taxing responsibilities or the most mundane socializing without a xanax. My grades suffered. I lost a job. I had my first bit of legal trouble after damaging some random cars; I was wasted on a cocktail of xanax, cocaine, and whiskey so I have zero memory of doing so or what had enraged me in the first place. I eked by the semester, and the following term I cut back to one class and instead worked full-time to pay my court costs and probation fees. That didn’t last long. I constantly violated probation, ending up with an alcohol tether.

I OD’ed that spring from a mixture of prescription meds, and as a result, dropped out of school and moved back in with my parents. I went to my first, and only, stint in rehab, spending two weeks at Brighton Hospital. It kinda worked…I guess. I strung together a decent chunk of sobriety, only to relapse during the brief interval between drug tests, when I would calculate the next feasible time I could be dropped. Even so, my “sobriety” over the next year was erratic, forced, and incredibly reluctant. It took some time to overcome my overwhelming listlessness, having zero motivation to do anything. I worked a variety of jobs over the next two years, and paid off some student loans. I caught a charge for disorderly conduct. Probation kept me from going off the rails, mitigating my drug use. I felt like I had come a long way so I re enrolled part time

I earned pretty good grades that first year back, and made an honest effort to get off benzos after the fall term. I became conscious of how much drugs had set me back, being the oldest students in every class. A doctor weaned me off so the withdrawals weren’t as severe. That summer, I was in the best position I had been in years, scheduled to graduate in the fall. Plus, I wasn’t actively addicted to anything.

Unfortunately, the pressure to graduate and start a career got to me, and I resumed using benzos and adderall. I tossed in painkillers for good measure. I tried heroin. Predictably, when finals came around I couldn’t get my hands on any of these drugs that made it possible for me to relax, and focus enough to complete my schoolwork. I didn’t even bother writing the final papers for two classes. I felt defeated, like I wouldn’t ever gradute, not because I wasn’t intelligent enough, but because of my personal failings. I took another semester off, moved out to Ann Arbor (again), and then signed up for a lighter class load, determined to graduate.

This was around the time I met Jeff. As t happened, we were both getting xanax from the same source. But it wasn’t until I became good friends with his roommate Max that I had the chance to know Jeff. I spent a lot of time over their apartment, watching sports (sometimes betting on them) and playing video games. Jeff and I weren’t as hardcore gamers as the rest of them were, so I often found myself hanging out with Jeff in the living room as the others were glued to their computer screens. What cemented our friendship was an incident with another person who lived in the building. He was always over their apartment, gambling online. He showed some skill, and won some large sums a couple times. Seeing that, Jeff let Tyler, as he was called, to gamble a predetermined amount on Jeff’s account and they’d split the winnings. Tyler won a big chunk and then lost it all on a complicatedcomplicate parley. Jeff had lacrosse or something at this point, so he had to leave. However, he was still logged on, and Tyler, who was, as it became more and more obvious, a gambling addict, proceeded to place a few more bets. He lost a hundred, then two, won a little back, lost some more. At this point, he was about to place another bet when I intervened. I didn’t know what kind of agreement they had and I was only vaguely aware that he was using Jeff’s account, but I thought it inappropriate that he was gambling with Jeff’s money when he wasn’t present. Additionally, his bets were increasingly risky, with larger sums, in an effort to recoup prior losses. I took the laptop away, told Max to wait for Jeff to return, and left.

As it turned out, Tyler had lost like a $1000 of Jeff’s money, and all those bets were placed without Jeff’s permission. Tyler placated Jeff’s wrath with promises of paying him back soon. When those were revealed to be lies, and Tyler was otherwise blasé about the situation, Jeff texted me for advice. I was surprised at first but I think he did for two reasons. First, I was the only one to step in as it was happening. Secondly, I think Jeff looked up to me in some way–not out of admiration, but because I was older by 4-5 years with a wealth of “life experience”. I told him that with a person like Tyler, you actually have to frighten for anything to happen. He was the reason bookies resorted to violence, because nothing else registered with this type of person. Soon, after many futile attempts to address Tyler to redress the wrong, Jeff put Tyler in a headlock, and immediately, he started wailing like a child. Jeff released him, and Tyler was now visibly scared but willing to come up with a solution, right then. The problem was, no acceptable solution presented itself, nor ever would.

As we later found out, Tyler had burned so many bridges for this same reason; everyone in his life were direct victims of his out of control gambling, his parents included. Jeff was grateful for my advice, which saved him from months of frustration. I know that we’re supposed to pooh-pooh physical aggression nowadays, but on some primal level, I couldn’t help but admire his willingness to escalate the situation that way. We were now, without a doubt, friends.

I was still doing xanax and adderall, but I was now seeking out painkillers like vicodin and oxycotton. Previously, I only took them if they randomly came across my path. I was mostly doing them with my friend Omar, who previously had an issue with heroin. In the drug world, it doesn’t take long for you to find what you’re looking for, and once you do, you’re offered a slew of things just like it. At first I just wanted vicodins and perocets. Soon, I could procure opanas or dilaudids, which were much, much stronger. If I wanted, I could purchase heroin, and I did two or three times. The problem with pills is that their supply depends on, firstly, a doctor to writing a prescription ane secondly, a pharmacy filling it. Therefore, their availability ebbed and flowed with the time of the month, until it could be refilled. However, heroin never faces a shortage, as long as you had the right dealers. Even so, I confined my use to the pharmaceuticals except for those few exceptions.

I did reasonably well that fall term, and entered my final semester before graduation. One time, hanging out at their apartment again, I told Max how I had bought and consumed some oxycottons earlier that night. Jeff overheard and asked if I could get anymore. I couldn’t, but we got to talking about drugs. He told me to let him know whenever I could I get any opiates, and said he could sometimes get vicodins. Previously, we had only smoked weed and done xanax together. A handful of times, he gave me a bar (a 2mg xanax pill) or I gave him one when either of us were going without, miserably anxious from the withdrawals.

A Cautionary Tale (3/ )

Not long after, he texted me about the same thing, and offered to drive anywhere if it was necessary. I needed to get some adderall so I could effectively cram for class, but I could only find it from someone in Detroit. I had no ride. The same guy also had norcos (another hydrocodone pill), so Jeff picked me up and we headed to Detroit. We spent most of the hour long drive from Ann Arbor engrossed in coversation. Jeff mentioned how he didn’t want people to know he was using painkillers, a subtle way of asking not to talk about our business. He dropped me off right away once we got back to campus. This established the precedent for the rest of our relationship: meet up, drive to the dealer, buy drugs, get high, and split up. If we hung out at all before or after these missions, it was at my studio apartment.

We were doing this semi-regularly until the end of the school year. A month or so before finals, it suddenly became much harder to find those pills. This was around when the government started cracking down on the number of opiate prescriptions. At Omar’s prodding, I did heroin a few more times. Once, Jeff came over while Omar was already over at my place. Omar pulled out some dope, cut up a few lines, and offered one to each of us. I hemmed and hawed for appearances, even though I knew I would do it, but Jeff didn’t skip a beat. I followed suit. We sat around listening to music and bullshitting, intermittently nodding off for a beat and then awaking with a spasm just as suddenly. This memory is particularly painful, because Omar also passed away from a drug overdose 18 months later. That’s one aspect of heroin no one warns you about–do it with others for any length of time and ghosts are going to populate your memories.

And for the next couple months, heroin slowly replaced percocets as a weekly or bi-weekly indulgence. I wasn’t yet addicted, but it wouldn’t be long at this pace. Either Jeff would drive us to link up with the dealer, or we would wait for him at my apartment. Mostly, we stuck to insufflation as the method of ingestion, but there were a few times when we smoked it off tinfoil. For awhile, dope was our little secret. Almost always, we split and paid for the drugs equally. “Dealer” was applicable to either of us in relation to the other, though both of us sometimes shared with the other if he ran out in between pickups.

We both graduated that spring. Things continued as they were, Jeff and I still getting high together for as long as he remained in Ann Arbor. I knew he was preparing for med school, but I didn’t really know what I was going to do. For the longest I imagined my life would suddenly improve once I had graduated but that didn’t happen. Instead, my drug addiction steadily worsened, now without a long-term goal to work towards. Around this time that I (and then Jeff) met Bigs. He was the second “professional” dealer I had ever known. Before, I could only score dope through a middleman for marked up prices. But Bigs was the plug. He always had sacks of heroin and coke/crack; carried a gun; and paid rent and bought nice cars with the money he made from hustling. When he asked for it, I gave Jeff Bigs’ phone number so Jeff could contact him without me. I bring up Bigs not to shift blame, but because I can’t tell my story without him, whose outsized influence determined the trajectory of my life.

I moved in with a couple of Jeff’s roommates from the year before, and got a job at a restaurant downtown to support myself until I figured out what to do with my life. But now that I knew a dealer who would deliver the heroin, it became an almost daily thing. I saw less of Jeff since he had moved back home, but one day Bigs called me to yell furiously about how he would no longer deal with Jeff directly because of how explicit his text messages were; from then on, he had to go through me to deal with Bigs. So, usually whenever there was a Michigan football game on the weekend, I’d met up with Jeff, and mediate his deal with Bigs

I overdosed a few times, but those experiences did nothing to deter me from using. Usually, they were because I mixed drugs or, having done a little bit, did a significant bit more, which would just be enough. With heroin the line between a safe, super euphoric high and an overdose is slim. I was again put on probation for stupidly writing a bad check for $60. I only did it because I needed money for dope and felt like shit. Knowing I had to drug test soon, I devised a plan to keep using and stay out of jail. I planned to quit and then use right after dropping, but I even failed the first test after 5 clean days. Violations for dirty drops were served with stricter stipulations, like testing twice a week. But since I had already progressed to injecting a few weeks before, I believed I couldn’t stop. I kept failing and figured I’d have to go to rehab soon, but could end up in jail for a few weeks.

Then, after overdosing at my parents’ place one night, I abruptly quit. I used a few suboxen strips to ease the withdrawals. I became cognizant of how totally heroin had hijacked and nearly destroyed my life. Jeff texted me during this period, but I told him how I had quit “dogfood”. I was still drinking and doing coke way too much. However, for me, that was a welcome improvement. I tried to steadily rebuild my life into something worth waking up to everyday. The idea of taking the GRE and attending grad school solidified into a real goal for the near future. I reached out to friends I had neglected for the last 6 months. I started dating a good friend. I partied too much, but at least I was forging connections as a part of my high instead of nodding off alone in the dark.

I tried to distance myself from Bigs, but he was always stopping by to serve my roommates and other randos downtown. I was turned off most by his impulse for violence over something as petty as $20, which became more apparent

A Cautionary Tale (4/5)

I had only heard Bigs boast of how he assailed someone over money, but only when I saw it happen to another and then to myself that I realized he was dangerous. I owed him something like $50, and agreed to repay him on a specific date, but as it happened, I overdosed that same day on drugs he had sold me. When I was released from the hospital, he averred that I owed him $30 for every day I was late, even though I had the fifty. I thought he was joking. And when I didn’t pay him, he literally barged into my house and assaulted me in the middle of a small party, and then tried to act like I was in the wrong for provoking him to be the bad guy in front of everyone. I was humiliated and frightened; I decided if fighting back would just exacerbate the situation.

I wasn’t making much money at the time, so I never had the extra cash to pay off everything I owed Bigs at once. Then he’d tax what was originally a tax, and come over every few days solely for this type of extortion. It was pretty terrifying for a huge ex-con to randomly stop over, not knowing if he was in a violent rage or sociably cool. One of the few times he was in a good mood, he wanted to hang out and drink a few beers, but I was irritated that he had just had someone come to my house to purchase drugs from him. A young British guy, he asked Bigs during the transaction if this was heroin or fentanyl “not that he cared”. Bigs promised that it was pure heroin, assuring him that he tested everything he sold. For so many reasons I didn’t want to be around Bigs, so I made up an excuse to leave, but only left after making sure he had left too. He had an irksome habit of lingering. I grabbed a coffee around the corner, and came back to find an out-of-place zippered case. I opened it to find an eightball of coke and even larger sum of heroin. Half-expecting Bigs to come back or contact me in a panic about losing his drugs, I hid the heroin, or what I thought was heroin, in the back of my closet. I did the coke with a friend. Obviously, I had no intention of returning any of it to Bigs. I figured I could find someone to give the dope to and finally pay Bigs back once and for all.

So for a week, the heroin sat there in my closet, untouched and unused. I had quit it months before, and never wanted to go through that hell again, but in moments of boredom my mind gravitated to the free drugs I had ready at hand. Finally, I succumbed to the temptation, and was pleasantly surprised to find it very potent. Dark brown like heroin and tasting like heroin, I concluded that Bigs told the truth– this was nearly pure heroin. I spent a few days snorting lines all day and night, which caused a fight with my new girlfriend. She was furious that I was obviously under heroin’s influence after nodding out repeatedly while we hung out. The addict within precluded me from flushing the remainder down the toilet, but made me doubly eager to get rid of what was left.

So when Jeff texted me on April 15, 2018, asking about xanax, which I didn’t have, and then about “anything else”, I thought it a fortuitous coincidence. From our history of doing opiates, I knew what he was hinting at. Although never mentioned by name, Bigs’ presence pervaded our conversation. He’s “my boy” that shorted Jeff the last time, and I referred to him as “my friend” later on. Jeff knew Bigs was my source, but was delighted to find out that I already had it on me, saving him a drive. I split up what I had left, and met Jeff across the street. I hopped into his car, gave him his portion, and busted out my own baggie to make up a small line. I asked if he wanted one but he declined. We made idle conversation about what had been going on in each other’s lives since it had been awhile since we saw each other last. Before I did my line, I pointed to it, and told him he should do lines that size, if not smaller. I reiterated how strong the dope was, how it was some of “the best shit I’ve ever had.” I had only shared a little bit with one other friend before this, and I watched her inject it to ensure she did not do too much (and to be there if she did). His acknowledgment of my warnings seemed more perfunctory than genuinely understood. I could tell he was eager to take off. He thanked me again with a sincere grin and barely concealed giddiness.

When he texted me later about its potency, I was slightly dismayed. I said it was heroin only because that’s what I had been told (well, technically, had heard), and there was no or grayish hue. This was dark brown. Distinguishing between them is like telling the difference between an 80 proof whiskey and a 100 proof one-you really won’t know until you’ve already done too much. (In retrospect, I think many of the times I thought I was doing heroin it was actually fentanyl. This would have skewed my perception.)

Jeff knew of my history of overdoses (and my use of different methods of ingestion), so in my mind, asking if one could overdose from just snorting heroin was another way of asking if I had overdosed from sniffing it. Nearly all of my overdoses happened from snorting the drug versus smoking or shooting it. Again, I advised him to be safe, and to exercise extra caution. The subtext of these admonitions was do a lot less than you would have in the past, especially with no tolerance. I don’t think I had ever warned him before to be careful because of how strong it was, which I thought should give him pause. Personally, I proceeded with a new batch under the assumption it was fentanyl or super pure heroin; only after doing a tiny bump to gauge its strength would I revert to normal-sized doses. I hoped he took similar precautions. Regardless, I was not alarmed enough to think he would not be okay by the following morning.



As it happens, I ended up overdosing on the same stuff that exact same week, so I didn’t hear about Jeff until later. One of roommates who also lived with Jeff the year before told me the horrible news. Since no one knew for sure, we were left to speculate. That same roommate suggested that it was probably an overdose from mixing opiates with benzos. I had no idea, partly because my own overdose blurred the timeline of events. I only survived because I fell out around friends, who dropped me off on the porch of U of M’s hospital. It wasn’t until the detectives saw me last November that I definitively knew Jeff’s cause of death.

But that was the last time I ever did heroin, to this day. I never did make enough money to pay Bigs off, who, in the spring of ’18, frequently brought up how his friend wanted coke and xannies, and by supplying him, make some extra money and pay Bigs off. I rejected the idea repeatedly. Regardless, I couldn’t find any xanax, and since Bigs was supplying the coke, the pretext for my involvement was not applicable. After a month of rebuffs, Bigs waited for me at my house one day, asserting how serious it was that we meet up with his friend. We arranged to meet at a bar, and Bigs handed me a gram of coke in the parking lot before heading in. He told me to handle the deal alone.


On the drive back, Bigs tried to persuade me to see how beneficial an arrangement like this would be, mentioning how this guy wanted large quantities. So when he contacted me the following week, asking for two ounces of coke, I was a little dismayed but half-expected it. I didn’t have a speck of coke, and no money to get any, so I wasn’t really interested. That is, until Bigs came over in a rage and literally stomped on my chest as I was sitting on the floor. He threatened “serious consequences” if I didn’t have the rest of his money that night; I felt like things had already escalated way too far. But when I mentioned how his friend had hit me up for two ounces, he morphed into a helpful friend, and assured to front me two ounces for the deal. I didn’t even really care about making any money, I just wanted to put an end to Bigs’ claims that I owed him money and have some drugs for myself. That night, as he handed me a softball size bag of coke (I had never seen so much dope before), he swore that if I didn’t return back with the money, even if I still had the drugs, he would knock on my parent’s door and collect from them.

In hindsight, the fact that his “friend” was an undercover the whole time, and Bigs the confidential informant, was predictable. There were so many warning signs, but I was too coked out to notice. This incident lead to my current incarceration. I wasn’t a dealer so I had no idea about the 50 gram laws. My old roommates and even the D.E.A. can confirm most of what I’ve related here.

Just so it’s clear, I want to reiterate that I’m only in prison right now because my dealer was working with the cops and supplied me with the drugs to sell to the undercover, which I only did after a barrage of threats. The dope I gave Jeff literally fell into my lap (and came from the same source), and I overdosed off of it as well. I’m lucky to be alive, but unlucky in every other way. I feel like I’m a victim to the same forces just Jeff was. My addiction to heroin didn’t even last a year, but its consequences may consume my life.

My present situation is so surreal that I get dizzy if I dwell on it too long; two and a half years ago, I couldn’t even imagine this within the the realm of possibility. What I really needed then (and now)was inpatient rehab, not incarceration. I went from never having done a day in county jail to facing a half of a lifetime in prison. The worst part is that in both these cases, I genuinely felt like I was helping someone out. Hell, Jeff believed I did him a favor at the time. At its very core, this was a total accident. No one did anything against their will. I had limited control over what eventually transpired.

I’m left with a thousand regrets: I wish I never found those drugs. I wish I never met Bigs. Sometimes I wish it was me instead of him. Finally, I wish I never started doing drugs, or at least, I wish I never picked up heroin.

I understand the seriousness of the matter, which I’m not downplaying. The fact that Jeff had a bright future and long life ahead of him makes it acutely devastating. However, justice can’t be based on how grievously a victim is mourned. Giving me a lighter sentence does not detract from the tragedy of Jeff’s premature end. I don’t think the two–my punishment and honoring Jeff’s memory–are directly correlated.

I personally know of habitual offenders and big time dealers receiving 4-7 years for the same charge. Considering my extenuating circumstances, I deserve that kind of sentence instead of a penalty meted out for second degree murder convictions. My incarceration has had zero effect on the distribution of drugs simply because I was just a consumer. Additionally, all my legal troubles stemmed from addiction; no motive more sinister than what’s essentially a health issue decided my behavior.

Since coming to prison, I got clean for the first time in my adult life. Like an evil spell being lifted, I can again build healthy habits and make ambitious plans. I’ve realized I have so much to offer the world. After all, I graduated just a year prior to prison so I never had much chance to utilize my degree. I plead with the court that I’m given a chance to rejoin society while I’m still in my 30s. My actions, as I’ve explained here, clearly don’t merit a harsh sentence; if anything, they warrant considerable leniency. I did something thousands of addicts do every day without a second thought, acting without a shred of malice. I wish more than anything Jeff was still with us. Yet, our roles could have just as easily been reversed, or I passed away as well. Would that have been justice?

I (20M) started smoking weed since 16 and i think that i have a high tolerance,but  this happened to me 4 times in the span of 4 years. Yesterday  i was on a big party, drinking smoking, around 3 am i start to feeling dizzy and i go outside for a walk, in a couple of seconds i was sweating and the next that i see is my friends trying to wake me up. I was on the ground a few seconds, but i was ok, i went with a few friends to my home and i felt very good walking home, we  even  smoke a joint in my house.

As i say, this isnt the first time that i have this problem, all the times have in common the same symptoms, sweat, extremely hot, and the black out, and all the times i felt well after a couple of minutes. I dont know if this is a tolerance problem, honestly i smoke a lot and i never have problems with that(except this times), this time i was drinking with soda so i dont think is a sugar problem. 

My father and two brothers use to have this problems, not for weed, (needles, highs...), i dont have issues with this things but all the times that i blacked out i was smoking so i guess that is the main factor. 

Have somebody experience something like that? Any tips?

For the chronic pain I have a 10mg Buprenorphine patch (lasts 5 days to a week depending on if I apply heat in that time) panadeine forte (30mg codeine 500 paracetamol, I usually take 2) and the doc just prescribed me amitriptyline (Endep?) 10mg to take once a day before bed and then we'll up the dose in a week or so.
For ADHD I take 2x 5mg dexamphetamine 3-4 times a day but I skip some days mostly on the weekend or I start feeling really run down, plus it kills my apetite and I go 3-4 days without eating and don't notice until I pass out. 

I don't love the patches, I've found I get insanely nauseas for the first two days and if I take the panadeine more than once in a day for breakthrough pain and I think it's making my migraines worse.

Pain wise the patches definately help with my base level of chronic pain, but they really limit my ability to use breakthrough meds and remain a functional person if I have a flair up, I can generally take a panadeine fort or two as long as I dont need to leave the house and can remain horizontal, once I sit or stand up I just feel flawed with nausea, so I want to see if maybe smoking a really weak joint can either replace the codeine as a breakthrough (obviously not when I need the dex to be working well) or potentially smoke at night every night, in which case I could go back to the 5mg patch and codeine during daytime. 

I also just generally used to really like winding down occasionally with a joint or using recreationally instead of drinking while out with friends because alcohol causes really horrendous flair ups of the endo pain.

The Endep is a new script and I haven't tried it yet. I'm hopefull it'll help but I know not to get my hopes up. 

I have pretty low blood pressure and dex brings up my heart rate a bit but my blood pressure always reads as the very low sides of average (I pass out if I stand up too quick even on dex) 

Does anyone know if/how cannabis interacts with Buprenorphine patch 10, dexamphetamine (not at the same time but in the same day), Endep and codeine?

I stayed up for 1 and a half days doing around 2.5 g with breaks in between. At one time i saw shadow figures and went paranoid and had audio hallucinations. I then took 3 0.5 xanax and 0.66 litre beer and didnt feel anything even tho i have no tolerance.

 Then I made a half hour break and had an intensive talk to my father and I finally made a good decision - to give the coke some girl i still owed 2 g which i planned to snort it myself and give to her months later (i dont have a job and no money because i cant control drugs) and to quit drugs finally (wanted to go to rehab in  2 months because on my birthday I wanted to be at home) but I made the decision to go to rehab ASAP

 I still had like a 0.4 and proceeded to snort it all in 1 minute and was super coked. There were 2 persons in her room who I didnt know but they were on ketamine and literally didnt say a word for hours, probably k holed because the k was cooked before. Everything was fine and I asked her for a fat weed bowl so I could smoke the last weed bowl togethee with my last coke lines. Also no more weed tolerance. Everything was fine until i came down from the coke. At this point I had an insane amount of bpm probably around 180-200 and had cold sweats and anxiety attacks. I think I was close to a seizure. Last week I went to hospital because of a similar overdose but only from coke and alcohol and only had a bpm of 135 and it felt not even close to that yesterday even tho I had chest pain which I didnt yesterday..

 I really dont know this girl and her boyfriend well have seen them like 3 times but they were sympathic to me tho. They asked me multiple times If i was fine and i said yes everytime and I didnt understand much they said to me. But they knew I was pale as fuck and even tho i said i was fine they did a lot of things to me and I was sorry to kill the vibes but all they wanted is to make me feel better.. it didnt get worse but also not much better within an hour.

I then had to take the last train at 22.50 pm and i asked if i could have a decent ket line of cooked k (at this point i forgot about the xans and alcohol and I wouldnt have done it because I dont know the interactions)

I still didnt understand much the last hour and basically just stared them in the eyes with random answers and without questioning the boyfriend of the cute girl(also very sympathic) went with me to the train station in order to make sure i would make it there (no chance I wouldve managed to get there alone).. In the train i started peaking and the 10 minute ride felt like hours.. Once I got out of the train i had the biggest hallucinations i ever had walking 1 km to my house in a dark street with no lights.. Everything was s blurry I couldnt see a single thing and eventually saw people but they werent actually there.

This was the most intense high of my life if you dont consider alcohol coma a high and I am so grateful what they did with me - almost a stranger and idk what wouldve happened if they didnt. I have experience with all the drugs especially weed bowls  but  at the time i had only a coke tolerance so it definitely was way to much all combined, think I was close to dying there.

I've been planning on myself for months. I've always been curious to try the so-called mushrooms. I've never tried any other psychoactive drugs, except a little bit of marijuana, also out of curiosity. But just once, and since I didn't feel anything, I killed curiosity. So I planned to try the mushrooms. searched the Internet and found a site, bought 6g.

After much reading, I decided that my trip would be this morning, fasting, only 2g of dried cogus. It was all planned, I was safe, well, decided and knew exactly what area of my life I wanted to delve into the journey. However, the whole experience showed me that as much as I read reports and was prepared for the moment, it was all new. It started out very surreal. 1 hour after eating the cogus, I felt my whole body. It started with a chilly cold. And my body...  Was like he's talking to me, through me. I was in pain, well, it wasn't really pain. But a few tensions, after a deep relaxation. I woke up seemed to be living in a world. And when I closed my eyes, new and more delusional thoughts began. Part of the biggest trip was done with my eyes closed because I couldn't process my body. And the worst part of it all was that in my head it felt like everything was going to go I didn't see any animals, no moving objects. With my eyes open I saw stripes floating, the colors were enlivened, I tried to get up and I felt my body unable to control itself. After a long 2 hours, there was a deep depression. I've never been un immersed in my life and myself like in those minutes. I cried wildly, my whole life went through my mind in minutes. shock. And I wondered ""how do I only take 2 grams?"". I didn't see any animals, no moving objects. With my eyes open I saw stripes floating, the colors were enlivened, I tried to get up and I felt my body unable to control itself. After a long 2 hours, there was a deep depression. I've never been un immersed in my life and myself like in those minutes. I cried wildly, my whole life went through my mind in minutes. And I felt very small. Very much so. Fragile. Lying there wrapped in a bed. I spent long minutes, it seemed like eternity. And when it did, I felt again. I felt my body. I was willing to change part of myself and who I am. It seemed all right. Spent. Five hours later. 

What remained was a lived experience in minutes of learning that I will take with me for years. I feel renewed. Like I'm back to reality. I spent the most loving day and sought more contact with my family. The things that were making me boring and displeased, I don't feel anymore. It's all different from yesterday. Today I feel alive. I don't know, that's crazy! But I feel alive. 

That's it, guys! Watch out for your lives! 

I won't repeat the trip. Like I said, it was all very unforeseen, uncertain. I don't want to take the risk again. Was that a bad trip?

After getting into some shit over smoking weed, I stashed my paraphernalia in a ziplock bag until I move out. I decided to relocate it and move the non-trash items to a new bag, so I throw the pipe, grinder, and lighters in a shiny new ziplock bag. This leaves me with an old ziplock bag containing 2 paperclips coated in resin, a crumpled up paper towel, and an empty weed baggie.

So, just throw it in the fuckin garbage, right? Wrong. My dumb, paranoid ass decides it would be too smelly, so I crumpled up the ziplock, which ended up being slightly smaller than my fist, and flushed it down the shitter.

.... and immediately the toilet clogs, on account of the whole ""ziplock bags shouldn't go down the toilet"" thing. After 1 round of intense plunging, the toilet flushes again but very slowly and chugs whenever it gets low.

I wanted to get all of y'all's thoughts, opinions and suggestions cause I'm pretty experienced with acid but I've only done molly once. The current plan is as follows: I'm gonna candyflip about 1 tab and maybe 75mg, but here's where it gets hairy... I told my friends about this and they want to try to flip it too. The thing is that they've (3 people) never done molly but have a decent amount of experience with acid. We're also gonna have two other friends with us. One is planning on taking a half tab (first timer) and another wants to just try rolling with us (also first timer). I have a couple questions. Firstly, I've been really good in any kind of emergency situation even when tripping balls on acid, but I've never candyflipped before and I want to know if you guys think I'll be good. Secondly, I'm worried about my friends candyflipping never having done molly before. Lastly, I'm worried about the girl taking acid for the first time for a couple reasons, the first being the most obvious that she's taking acid for the first time, even if it is only half a tab, but also because she might get FOMO or something because she isn't rolling with us leading to a bad trip. Do you think that's a concern? What should I do in this situation? I could probably convince them to space it out throughout the first day into the night, but we're only staying for one night and I don't really wanna feel like total dogshit the next day. Another thought I had is just rollin or just trippin so I can help if needed, but I'm only about 80% sure I can talk someone down in that state of mind. (Done it three times trippin, never rolling). I could go the responsible route and tripsit my dumbass friends but I really don't want to. Do you think it will be ok? Should I just roll? Trip?

One day I ran out of benzos because of the virus, took my opiates with an anti-histamine instead (dramamine). The result was a feeling like I had little tolerance at all. 

Now, I don't know if this is exclusive to the antihistamine+opiate combination, or if benzos+opiate is actually lowering the effects from opiates. What's your experience on this?

To be more specific, my go-to opiate (technically an opiod) is tramadol because I can easily get a whole box of 60 capsules OTC for less than 20 bucks. I've tried Oxy and it feels the same to me.

I have anxiety and depression, and though the depression has responded quite well to mindfulness and psychotherapy, I still have bouts of really intense anxiety.

I've taken relatively high doses of the common psychedelics, and I've had both really good and really bad trips. I guess what I'm asking is this: how likely is it that I will have a bad ""trip"" using K?

Done Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), not exaggerating, about 50 times give or take a few. I'm having parnoid thoughts and am diagnosed already with 2 disorders, Borderline-Personality Disorder and Bipolar 1. Schizophrenia develops in men earlier than women (16-24 I believe around that age) and I'm in that ballpark. Diphenhydramine is linked to Alzheimer's and Dementia but there's little research done on it because it's not a mainstream recreational drug. I can't find anywhere online about it being linked to Schizophrenia, is it?

Okay, so a little background for why I am asking this. I've done way more than my fair share of Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) to get rickity rickity wrecked, and I decided to look at long term effects of it. There doesn't seem to be much research done on it, especially at high doses like 500mg+. The only thing I can find is that it's linked to causing Alzheimer's and/or Dementia, even if it's used as directed. Say you take 1 pill a night for sleep for 1 year, you're at higher risk of Alzheimer's and/or Dementia (yes that means you could develop both at the same time). Now I've never done less than 24 of the 25mg pink Diphenhydramine pills at a time. I've even done 100 twice (one time I woke up in the hospital, the other time I threw up after passing out and I assume that saved my life) so I know I'm at a greater risk of those two diseases. Well I did a lot of reading on multiple sources for Schizophrenia and I fit some of the criteria for males developing it. I read that it is unknown what causes it, but they suggest that drugs such as LSD, and meth can cause it, environment, and genetics. But researchers are still not sure. It also says that males can develop it from early to late teens even early 20s. So with the little amount of research done on Diphenhydramine, and the fact that when doing a dose high enough it causes hallucination and symptoms of what I imagine would be very similar to Schizophrenia. It's obviously not good for your brain, especially at the doses I've done. And I'm by no means bragging, but I've done upwards of 50 of the 25mg pink allergy pills. I've been diagnosed with 2 different disorders by 2 different doctors, Borderline-Personality Disorder and Bipolar 1. I am very familiar with my symptoms and with proper medication I am capable of coping, most of the time. But lately I've developed this paranoia with anybody but my family. I feel like everyone is somehow plotting against me. I just recently cussed out a newly reunited friend because of some personal stuff at work and it got my roommate involved, and now I've got it stuck in my head that my roommate is still mad even though we made up, that everyone at my job is against me and I ended up quitting because I didn't want to work with people that I am convinced hate me and want me to leave the job anyways. I've been having several thoughts about people having bad intentions. Went to this reunited friend's friend's house to buy some acid and bud. He texted me telling me to come up his driveway, which was unusual and after I cussed out mutual friend out and I built it up in my head that he was going to jump me.
I do realize some of my symptoms in the above are of my BPD and Bipolar but some I'm not familar with and are new. Also, I've been incarcerated recently and even though it wasn't traumatizing, it was a hell of a 13 months and I don't think it could be linked to my new ""symptoms"" but I am affiliated and did have to keep awareness of my surroundings. But I've not been jumped or had these thoughts even down the road.

As we were cleaning it she suddenly ran out of the bathroom to the kitchen and i ran after her. When i made it to the kitchen i saw her slashing her arm with a knife quickly. It made a big wound that reached muscle tissue. This image is stuck in my brain and i feel very traumatised. Luckily she didnt hit any major veins.

This was my friends first time taking Molly. We dosed around 6pm. Prior to dosing(maybe 2 hours before), I had eaten 2 cheeseburgers from Wendy's and my friend did not eat anything. He said the molly hit him, and he felt the come up, his vision got a bit blurry and everything got brighter but after that he came down and wasn't tripping as hard anymore. 
For me I came up and it was hitting me with some good waves, this continued on between 7pm-11pmish. 

During the trip he said he was hungry and was thinking to eat a salad he had bought but never got around to it. 

So my question, due to my friend taking the molly on an empty stomach is it possible that his body just digested the molly really quick so he didn't feel the full affect? 
Has any one else experienced ?

Then, when everybody gets a little drunk I'll take 100ug LSD at about 21:30 and if needed add some 2cb when the peak is gone. What do you guys think about it? I have read some posts that doing LSD along with amphetamine isn't a good idea, but I will take a small dosage - it makes me talkative and with Phenibut it's really great, even at low dosages.

I would write one, but it wouldn’t be accurate because time became nonexistent. I also couldn’t differentiate between OEV and CEV, and it felt like there was a stage between opening my eyes and closing them. I even had trouble opening my eyes at times, because the sedation was that strong.

Anyway, I was seeing these beautiful patterns everywhere. Rainbow-colored spiderwebs on the walls, and it looked like I was seeing my room through a kaleidoscope. The posters on my walls were melting, and the zombie on my Walking Dead poster was dancing. In the background, I could see these hilariously distorted images of my coworkers running past me with shopping carts. 

The visuals were getting stronger, and all of a sudden I was launched into hyperspace. I felt the back of my head tingling, then I got loud tinnitus and it seemed like my room got much larger. Everything had a purple and neon tint, and rainbows were bouncing around the walls. Soon, the visuals were overwhelming, and I was panicking. Wishing that the trip would end. Every now and then, I would hear loud footsteps. The clock was ticking, and I realized by the sound that time was going very slowly. Minutes seemed like hours. I was getting slightly nauseous, but I couldn’t figure out how to open up the wrapper of my Ginger candy. I kept on thinking, “I need some water”, but I was unable to sit up.

I look at my bookshelf, and there are random words and hieroglyphics written in bright neon. I see silhouettes of eyeballs and mushrooms on the ceiling. I can’t remember my name, and I am completely out of touch with reality. All of a sudden, I see the words “You Are God”, and I see images of Creation. I feel like God. Meanwhile, I hear loud spaceship sounds and the back of my head feels like it is jiggling like jello. 

After a few moments of becoming God, I have an out of body experience. I see myself lying down, and I imagine that I am entering a dark cave with neon lights in the core. I see a beautiful old lady, her skin is dark and heavily wrinkled, and there is a certain radiance coming off of her. I know that she must be God. She looks at me, reaches out her cupped hands, and she is holding a ball of light. In this light, I see a reflection of myself. She tells me “You aren’t God, but God is you”.

I snap out of the trance, and the visuals are dying down. Things are still melting and breathing, but no more crazy colors. I feel a strong sense of peace and tranquility, and like usual, I enter the child-like state in which I’m giggling and sticking my fingers in my mouth. I’m touching my face as if COVID-19 doesn’t exist, and every touch and every lick feels majestic. I keep on leaning to the side of the bed, staring at the carpet. I almost fell out of bed, twice.

Is it really worth to let a benzo completely fast travel to the end of the day so I can pass out as early as I can to repeat the process?

The thing is... I also have 3.5 grams of purple ""moon rock"" MDMA. Ive never done molly and I also havnt tested it. It's incredibly rare and sells out almost instantly where I live so I bought an 8-ball of it just incase it isn't around for a long time. The bag is a bit powdery but thankfully doesn't look granular, more just like small crystal shards. There are also a number of ""large"" purple crystals in the bag. Its smells very strongly of black liquorice and I've been told the purple color means it was probably manufactured in Canada.

In all honesty, without a test kit probably will not be taking it... Buuuuut, if someone was to get very boerd and they took 90mg-100mg of MDMA would it to be to much/ to little or just right of a dose? Would the experience but uncomfortable if I was alone?  Finally on 90-100mg how visually intoxicated does a person usually get? By that I mean will I be overly sweaty, eyes extremely dilated, being loud and obnoxious, etc

Before this prescription, I sought treatment for depression which was later deduced to be, at least partially, a response to anxiety. I’d tend to shut down socially and academically when experiencing greater amounts of stress and anxiety.

Afterwards, I began to consider my anxiety potentially being a symptom of ADHD which I’ve suspecting having as far back as elementary school, despite performing well enough up until college. Before eighth grade, I was noticeably more hyperactive and impulsive than most of my friends until I grew more anxious and socially-withdrawn, but I’ve always struggled to maintain focus in conversations, lectures, and reading.

As suspected, I was properly diagnosed with and treated for ADHD, and aside from the focus enhancement, one of the great benefits I’ve received from amphetamine is anxiety suppression, and thus anti-depression too.

**To my point,** before beginning to take amphetamine, I had found myself getting increasingly anxious from smoking weed. I could usually dismiss this effect and at least appear calm, but I struggled to truly enjoy cannabis. Now, that struggle has been alleviated and I can feel comfortable smoking with others again.

Is it reasonable to anticipate a comparable reaction with stronger hallucinogens, namely serotonergics? Might amphetamine enhance a psychedelic experience for me, or is the risk not worthwhile?

**TLDR:** Adderall makes weed better for me. Could it improve psychedelics for me too?

* Rich, bizarre trains of thought

Which strains have given you the most psychedelic effects? And which strains are your favorite?

As I’ve gotten older I’ve been trying to make healthier choices even though that must sound laughable that I’m asking a question like this. My friend groups pretty regularly use cocaine on the weekends. 

I know cocaine is bad for your heart, but is there any evidence out there suggesting that it’s health defects may even be a LITTLE overhyped? i mean, i just don’t understand how I see people use it as frequently as they do, go on 24-36hour benders and combining it with alcohol, and outside of being hung over the next day they seem to be able to live pretty regular lives during the week. is there any evidence that supports “yes clearly cocaine is bad for you, but it’s not AS bad for you as anti drug propaganda propagates?”

my main question though, is as far as snortables go(my favorite) — is there any research suggesting that ketamine is “healthier” than cocaine, if they were compared in similar dosages/frequently?

for instance, If once every week on Friday nights I partied pretty hard with ketamine(it doesn’t “tranquilize” me anymore now that i am not naive to the substance anymore — it just helps me feel awesome, creative, sexy, and write better music/art, etc.)

i know it’s obviously harmful for you but i DO drink shit loads of water on it(to hopefully minimize bladder harm) — and i’ve found it’s made it much easier for me to pretty much completely avoid cocaine lol, since it actually seems to energize me and it’s fun snorting things.

anyone have any insight, anecdotes or knowledge? i know this is a pretty stupid “druggie” type question, feel free to laugh at me, but i do like to party, i’m not gonna lie. having parties, hosting parties, getting all of my friends together and just having the best time ever is pretty important to me, it’s likely to continue like this for a while.

gram for gram, line for line .... is ketamine “healthier” than other snortables like cocaine? what about snortable amphetamines? do we have any research/accepted knowledge out there that supports this thesis, or is it all just a guessing game at this point?

thanks guys!!! all the love, stay safe as much as is possible!

PS a typical example is this. We typically begin partying Friday evening at around 8 PM, and we typically stay up all night on Friday(or only nap for an hour or two after sunrise) and then typically continue to bender into saturday daytime until the sun goes down, and then we will crash at sundown/8pm saturday night and sleep 12-16 hours and wake up sunday around brunch time, have brunch together, recuperate sunday and get ready for the work week starting monday morning. so essentially we typically party hard/bender one night a week — and the question is how can we most sustainably continue this wild behavior in the most “healthy” way possible. (clearly were being stupid and unhealthy i get that — but just wanting to see if there’s any further adjustments we can make to continue our party-hard shenanigans while doing the least amount of harm possible. abstinence and not partying is NOT an option at the moment, just a heads up, sorry not sorry! 👊🙂💪)",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,688812,public,confidence,self,"Gram for gram, line for line… Is ketamine “healthier” than cocaine?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hf42t6/gram_for_gram_line_for_line_is_ketamine_healthier/,,no_ads,0.0,1593044744.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1593016319.0,,

I read that amineptine it is currently sold in India and Egypt.  I ask Indian and Egyptian users to check the current availability of this drug in these countries. anyone who knows a pharmacy, a small pharmaceutical industry that synthesizes it on commission or sell it, please let me know. if we join forces we can find it or have it produced, alone i can do little, only by passing from words to deeds, we can hope to get something.
 There are a lot of website of ""India markets"" that sell it, but they're all scams, that ask 100 or more dollars for 20 pills but didn't ship anything after receiving money, speculating on world's famine of amineptine. we have to collaborate and join forces, because this drug could be a life-saver. unfortunately it was withdrawn from the market because it really worked, and people were returning to their lives, ending up wasting money on unnecessary psychotherapy or ssri (check forums where users shares their experience with amineptine,it was amazing, more stamina, improved cognitive and memory, even better orgasm). this was unacceptable to lobbies, because a depressed patient is a client who spends money for life for ineffective treatments, and could not accept that people healed.  the reality is that amineptine was taking away the market from the ssri therefore it was withdrawn for phantom security reasons. I was visited by the best psychiatrist and neurologist,  working in hospitals and teaching at universities. They all said that to me, I'm not invent from my mind,they also told me that was amazing with parkinson too,without the dangerous sides of pramipexole for example. it was developed in France by Servier (the same company that produce stablon - tianeptine) and had a market share higher than the ssri.  the abuse problem was due to the fact that it was erroneously used in cocaine disaffection therapy, so cocaine addicts took huge quantities (10-20 grams per day) to try to recreate the same effect as cocaine. The lobbies used this fact to justify the withdrawal of amineptine. Consider that. ..have you ever seen a medicine withdrawn all over the world in the same moment for some abuse by cocaine addicts? Never happened...there are tons of harmful medication with hundreds of papers and studies demonstrating it, but still selled worldwide, even if patients and doctors know about the toxicity... and in any case we speak of very few cases, which do not concern depressed patients.  psychiatrists told me that bupropion it is used as a therapy for disaffection by cocaine too, and is taken by cocaine addicts shredded and then inhaled, but wasn't withdrawn from the market....

TLDR up front: Looking for ways to take powdered drugs orally. 

Due to all the covid stuff and studying from home tend to really struggle with prolonged focus lately (apparently working where i usually relax doens't work for me). A while ago a friend gave me some Ritalin and it really did wonders for my productivity (don't worry, i never do it more than once every two weeks). After the positive experience i got myself some 4F-MPH (some derivative of Ritialin) and it has mostly the same effects though (in small dosages). 

My question is the following: i got this stuff in powdered form and as i usually only take psychedelics i'm not really a big fan of snorting (at least my nose isn't), especially in the early morning before studying. Therefore i was wondering if anybody knows a good way to take this stuff (in powdered form) orally? Normally google would be my friend for this sort of thing but i'm somehow not finding much on this (wrong search terms maybe).

Might not happen in the short term but I definitly look forward. Psychedelics are yet to be discovered so I have no clue what it feels like. I've read and heard lots of trip reports but haven't experienced it myself. 

And still had a very vivid dream about it this night.

Beware the psychedelic virgin trip report !

Was with friend, no kids around, quite drunk sitting on a couch and in a very gloomy mood.
M. is handing me herbal tea and I drink it. 
All my friends are watching me and all of a sudden the colors went bright as fuck and all the bad thought and spleen is lift of my shoulder.
I feel i'm connecting in my mind with my friends.
M. is laughing. And I start laughing as well.

Still laughing I get up and notice that every time my heart rate increase I can see bright color patterns on a grey canvas. And it feel so euphoric. So I start running to trigger the highest heart rate. Friends are running too. 
This moment I realize in not in my normal state. I'm sure I'm under drugs but it's ok.
We decide to go exploring the world and as we get out all of us running I hear drums. I'm the only one hearing them and it boost our euphoria.
The night is beautiful and the stars are moving fast. The buildings have human trait and seems to be aware of us in a very gentle way. They bends to let us pass.

We arrive to a tunnel flesh like. It is a short tunnel we have to get through but it's tight. I'm seeing flesh but Another friend F start freaking out cause she think the tunnel is made of snakes.
I'm sliding throught the tunnel and ask F to join us on the other side.

I say "" come on F. I'm usually the scared and anxious one. You are strengh made human. And I am fear made human. I went through you can do it !""

She cries and tell me "" you're so obsessed with your problems and fears, you can't see other's pains anymore ""

I admit it right and now I'm here for her and she get through the tunnel.

We are back to the party. I hear A. telling M. "" what did you gave her, she's high as a kite, I never see her so sparkly and joyfull""
M. answer "" I've only put the dust of my shrooms in her drink. It was barely nothing, she's so susceptible.""

From now on I'm navigating beetween europhia with color pattern and nausea with anxiety. When I'm anxious in my dream I wake up (  Irl maybe? Maybe not ) actknowledge I'm only dreaming and falls back into the dream again where I go through another euphoria colored connected in everything state.

Now it's time to eat and I craving a soup. As I watch someone make the soup I'm noticing huge penises floating in it.
I began to scream to my friends "" dick soup ! Dick soup !"" Causing a general and shared hilarity. 

Now back to the couch. Effects are slowly wearing off. I'm swallowed by the couch into smooth confort. A. F. and M. are around me. We are talking and feeling our bonds getting stronger.

I says : "" it was amazing but please don't do this again. It's rude and wrong and it hurt my trust in you if you sneak drugs into my drinks. It was great but it could have been so wrong to not know I was high it's scary.""

Everyone looking at me very unsettled. And then everyone start speaking in synch :
"" But you knew it all along. You dosed it yourself"" 
The memory of me weighting and putting shrooms in my drink resurface while everyone still saying "" you knew it, you knew it all along""

Then I trully woke up.

This morning SO told me that I had the biggest smile  I ever had on my face while I was asleep. 

And today I'm reaching F. My dream was right, my obsessions with my own flaws made me neglect some friends.

You may argue this is not what a trip feels like. After all I can't know and this was just a dream with very dream like patterns. But damn that was wild and fun and very eyes opening.

Soooo... It's hella wild. Me&amp;my pal dropped extasy (I'm experienced at this, but for him it was the 1st time), we seemed to have a nice trip but then he got scared and started to tell me tales about horribleness of Nothing. We were talking like that for 3 hours (there is even a record somewhere) and every story ends with ""everything equals nothing and it is scary"". I got really crazy over the situation, but I knew that I should not reveal how scared I am or the vicious cycle of ""me scaring him scaring me"" will begin.

Then my pal tried to sleep but he was struggling with it. Another 3 horrible hours passed, he was still just lying awake, but I had to do some work so I left. When I returned home I found my pal with his eyes wide open just staring into the abyss, I even thought he was dead lol. So I approached him and asked what happened. ""Something irreversible"", he responded; ""I hear voices, I hear God, and He is dead now"".

About 30 minutes passed in silence, then he fell asleep. I moved from the bed to the chair and started to freak out. I was feeling sorry that I gave my friend extasy, I regretted every decision leading me to this. My pal is a pretty depressive person (he literally has a story beginning with ""It was a day when my father tried to kill himself because I tried to kill myself"") and there was no wonder that the trip ended like this, we should not have done it at all. The sense of guilt was so huge and so heavy that I literally could not stand this.

Couple of hours later he woke up and found me on the floor in a puddle of blood. It appears that I tried to cut my veins and fell unconcious. Nothing serious happened tho. The wound was not deep enough to threaten my life, but the blood soaked into floor and now there's a big purple bloodstain near my table.

This story taught me pretty much nothing, I did not stop doing synthetic drugs (methylephedrone/amphetamine/extasy), had a couple of other crazy stories, but then lost interest in it and now my drug menu is predominantly weed. As for my friend, he recovered soon, but decided not to touch extasy never ever ever again.

I was desperate, but fortunately met a dealer that lives across the street from me that just moved in. I asked how much for a half an ounce, and he stated $120.

But to my puzzlement, nobody gave me a straightforward answer.  It seemed like one of those things where nobody knows and yet pride dictated that nobody wanted to *admit* that they didn\'t have a clue.  People avoided, ducked/dodged the question.  Posted tweaky rants about other stimulants and formulations that were of only tangential relevance at best in the comments, hijacking the threads.  Told me I should be on some other totally different formulation.  Commented incoherent gibberish.  Finally fed up and sleep-deprived after an all-nighter, I got into it with one guy setting off an epic chain of absurd banter, a good-old-fashioned ""flame war"" that IIRC turned weirdly sexual at one point.  It was ridiculous and I still giggle about it to this day.  But all BS aside, I now have enough experience with both dextroamphetamine ER (a generic of spansules, but a high-quality generic) and Vyvanse to make a direct comparison.  Past me from 2017 and anyone else curious, here\'s your answer (and stop pretend flame-flirting with that guy and go to sleep!):\n\nVyvanse lasts about twice to 2.5 times as long as an IR Adderall (and presumably IR dex, may be able to confirm that in the future) and is lovely in its own right but does *not* live up to its advertised/marketing promises of ""lasting all day"", and due to its idiosyncratic biological ""release"" prodrug mechanism, it isn\'t *truly* an ""extended release"" formulation per se.  Amphetamine in *any* formulation and through any RoA is extraordinarily sensitive to urine pH, dietary intake variables, etc., but *all other things being equal*, if ""left to its own devices"" with minimal intake of foods/beverages that decrease urine pH, and perhaps intake of foods/beverages that  increase urine pH to boost/extend it etc., it lasts about 6-7 hours *max*--and on hour 6-7, it\'s going to be rapidly ebbing away.  Dex spansules, by contrast, again if taken under optimal conditions and ""left to their own devices"" (minimal eating of urine-acidifying foods, taken after a night of adequate sleep with no/minimal/reset tolerance on an empty stomach slightly pH-decreased, etc., etc.), can last up to approximately *twice* that long.  \n\nDuration-wise, spansules *deliver*.  This is therapeutically positive for controlling symptoms and/or staying speedy (in the fast lane over longer distances, to belabor the metaphor) throughout the waking day, but it can be problematic when it comes to insomnia.  Booster-dosing with Vyvanse is tricky and inadvisable.  Booster-dosing with spansules is damn near *impossible* if you want to sleep that night.  You can take a 30 or 40 mg Vyvanse between 10--11:30pm and be asleep by 6 or 7 (if you take Vitamin C, drink decaf green tea, etc. as you\'re winding down).  You can *not* take a spansule in that timeframe and be asleep by early morning.  So plan accordingly.\n\nSpansules are smoother throughout their duration of action, and the stimulating action/""high"" if you will comes in gentle waves of a sort.  They both kick in in roughly around the same time after dosing, but while Vyvanse has a more gradual onset, once it has fully kicked in, you subjectively get all of it, the peak feeling, which ""hits harder"" and kicks you in the face at higher doses.  It continues at that level for a few hours and gradually yet rapidly diminishes to the comedown.  No ""waves"" where you can feel phases of it subtly kicking in hours later to sustain continuity of blood dextroamph level as with spansules (which makes sense given the physical spansule design, with beads going off at staggered times).  It kicks in, you get it, you have it until you don\'t, that\'s it.  \n \nThat\'s the strange thing about Vyvanse--the best analogy is that there\'s a gradual gradient on- and off-ramp, but you\'re forcefully ""pushed"" *quickly* up and down them despite the gradual nature.  Dex spansules, on the other hand, while the on and off ramps\' ""gradients"" feel very similar in ""gradient"", which is also a gradual, not steep one--subjectively, the come-up and come-down *feel* more gradual because you\'re not moving up or down them as quickly, though you do get *on* the on-ramp from the level floor a little faster.  But once you\'re on, subjectively you feel the gradual nature of the gradient because you\'re not being shoved up it by someone jogging behind you.  That\'s an elaborate, weird metaphor but it\'s the best way I can describe this and compare the two.\n\nBecause dex spansules act in perfectly-overlapping/synchronized phases to maintain the ER mechanism, ""extend the release"", they\'re less emotionally-numbing (which can be a good or a bad thing depending upon the reasons you take them), frankly less tweaky, and you don\'t get ""stuck"" nearly as strongly--task-switching is actually possible!  (Who\'da thought?)  In general, you feel less ""drugged"" on them, hence the smoother aspect, because of those slight variations/dips in blood dextroamphetamine level throughout the day they allow you to have.  This is also counterintuitive--but that\'s, in the case of spansules, or at least it seems to be, a *good thing*.  Having a consistently high blood amph level isn\'t better functionally-speaking.  Spansules maintain sufficient amphetamine level in the bloodstream so you don\'t come down/crash between the bead-release phases, but those little dips remind you you\'re human.  It\'s easier to eat.  To interact with other people.  To remember there\'s a world outside of your own solipsistic little inner fantasy world/mind awash in chemicals.  To plan and execute different tasks rather than be buffeted by your speedy flighty whims and then inextricably beholden to them for the next several hours.  This is where spansules *really* shine over Vyvanse, IMHO.  Now, it\'s not like how people describe low-dose Desoxyn where you don\'t even feel like you\'re on an amphetamine at all, but it\'s a lot closer to that ""natural, non-drugged"" feeling than Vyvanse is.  Like with Addy, with Vyvanse you\'re *on frickin\' speed* and there\'s no escaping that.  Either you can\'t feel it, only get negative side effects at too-low dosages, or you\'re speeding hard at sufficient dosages.  There\'s a wider window of happy middle ground with spansules.\n\nIn a (sizable, maybe it\'s a huge coconut shell) nutshell, there\'s the core of the differences between Vyvanse and dextroamphetamine spansules.  The latter, on balance, are far superior in nearly every way when the doses are truly equal or near-equal.  The main problem is that they can work *too* well--last far too long (it can be useful/nice knowing that with Vyvanse there\'s a firmly-defined 6-7 hour max duration limit), and if you\'re sensitive to amphetamine or likely to be anxious (if the dose is too high for your tolerance at the time, or you have something else in your system that will interact with/amplify it, etc.), spansules will affect you worse, quicker.  Spansules are more sensitive, naturally, to gastrointestinal pH and that\'s a potential downside depending upon diet/lifestyle.  Apathy with Vyvanse was actually a plus for me, but for most people I can\'t imagine it would be, but anyway if you want to blot out the world and feel emotionally armored and apathetic without totally frying yourself and still staying within the bounds of oral pharmaceutical amphetamines, Vyvanse works well for that.\n\nSo there you go.  Despite the second-person perspective of much of this post that may imply otherwise, caveat that of course YMMV and this is all simply what I\'ve garnered from my personal experience and knowledge/conjecture about why these two formulations work the way they do based upon their different designs (physical ER mechanism versus biological/prodrug).  I have to say, everything else accounted for, I\'m doing a lot better on spansules (technically dex ER) versus a second daily dose of Vyvanse or even a ""booster dose"" of IR Adderall (which is tasty and nice to have around for other RoAs (snorting/plugging/sublingual/buccal), but yeesh can that be hardon a girl\'s skin/overall physical appearance, and good luck quitting smoking on IR Addy), and I wonder what else I could\'ve accomplished and how the last few years might\'ve been different had I started with spansules instead of what soon became 70 mg Vyvanse in divided daily doses.  \n\nNow I\'m also not totally disparaging Vyvanse here.  It\'s kept me afloat for the past ~3 years and there\'s a lot I like about it, namely: I like that it is converted in the body to enantiopure dex (I really like my enantiopure stims).  I like that the marketed/advertised ""lower abuse potential"" (BS or not in reality) might make certain stingy gatekeeping prescribers who operate on drug reputations rather than drug realities to Rx it where any other form of dex or Adderall/mixed salts might give them pause.  I *especially* like that the government pays for it (in my state, at least--and that\'s why I continue to stay on it for at least one of my daily doses, as while generic spansules are affordable, I still have to pay out of pocket for those).  ;-D  \n\nBut at the same time, bluntly in the cold light of dawn (after an speeding all-nighter, haha), I\'m glad we have it (another pharma amp formulation on the market is always welcome) but Vyvanse was in many ways a failed experiment in unprecedentedly ambitious amphetamine evergreening.  The original company that did the R&amp;D on it, it\'s said, was probably aiming for a CIII schedule classification which would make it eligible for refills and easier to prescribe more of, thus increasing profits.  This obviously didn\'t pan out, and it really isn\'t ""less abusable"" unless RoA is the only definition of ""abusability"".  It doesn\'t last nearly as long as Shire pinky-promises it does, requiring booster dosing for all-day symptom control, and something invented *half a century* before has nearly double its duration.  It turns out that having a constant high blood level of dextroamphetamine for several hours isn\'t optimal for executive functioning--which is a major facet of the whole reason most people take this stuff in the first place, licitly or not.  It\'s not easily soluble in water at all even though Shire insists it is.  It doesn\'t even have the convenience of being completely insensitive to gastric pH--in theory it should be, but I swear that it\'s *significantly* less effective when administered with any food in the stomach, and an extra-acidic stomach really blunts/mutes it, maybe not to the extent that it would nullify an IR formulation of dex or Adderall, but yeah.  Spansules were a *brilliant*, elegant invention.  Having taken both, I can now say that from a purely consumer, efficacy perspective, that wheel didn\'t need to be reinvented--spansules didn\'t need to be fixed as they weren\'t broken.  Sometimes what\'s tried and true works best, and this is just as true in the drug realm as it is with, say, home appliances and newfangled kitchen gadgets.  Dexedrine spansules, and really dextroamphetamine period in all its forms, are greatly under-prescribed due to outdated stigma that doesn\'t make sense in a world where pharma amphetamines are again ubiquitous.  \n\nIn conclusion (really more of a coda), to hell with people who don\'t answer simple, sincere, ingenuously asked questions on Reddit and instead give the asker shit rather than stop bloviating for a moment to admit they don\'t know, to hell with pharmaceutical companies that advertise disingenuously and perennially evergreen amphetamines in a plethora of ways to squeeze every possible dime of profit out of a century-old substance that everyone who needs it to cope should be able have cheap and easy access to the best forms of in this dystopian hellscape, and to hell with getting ""stuck"" and having your productivity go down the drain via an inability to task-switch--am I right?  ;-)  Spansules are stellar.  Fellow pillheads out there, (deftly) ask your prescriber, local ""ADHD"" dealer kid or clandestine Mexican mail-order pharmacist about dextroamphetamine ER/spansules today!', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, in autumn 2017 or thereabouts (feels like a decade ago, because that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s like when you&amp;#39;re a mentally-ill stimulant user in your 20s), around when I was first seriously offered a (dextro)amphetamine script of some variety by my psych to treat my severely disabling lethargic/fatigued TRD, I asked a naive, sincere question around Druggit in various subs (can&amp;#39;t recall which ones atm): given that Vyvanse is a prodrug for dextroamphetamine and purports, is advertised to be long-acting and therapeutically last &amp;quot;all day&amp;quot; (that&amp;#39;s how I remember Vyvanse being marketed in the early days--it was heavily implied that it was a &amp;quot;one and done&amp;quot; formulation), &lt;strong&gt;what are the subjective, qualitative differences between Vyvanse and Dexedrine Spansules/dextroamphetamine ER, all other things being equal, and accounting for dosage (applying the conversion)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought this was going to be a simple, straightforward question I only didn&amp;#39;t know the answer to because I was a newbie, lack of experience, just beginning to make a lane change into the fast lane.  But to my puzzlement, nobody gave me a straightforward answer.  It seemed like one of those things where nobody knows and yet pride dictated that nobody wanted to &lt;em&gt;admit&lt;/em&gt; that they didn&amp;#39;t have a clue.  People avoided, ducked/dodged the question.  Posted tweaky rants about other stimulants and formulations that were of only tangential relevance at best in the comments, hijacking the threads.  Told me I should be on some other totally different formulation.  Commented incoherent gibberish.  Finally fed up and sleep-deprived after an all-nighter, I got into it with one guy setting off an epic chain of absurd banter, a good-old-fashioned &amp;quot;flame war&amp;quot; that IIRC turned weirdly sexual at one point.  It was ridiculous and I still giggle about it to this day.  But all BS aside, I now have enough experience with both dextroamphetamine ER (a generic of spansules, but a high-quality generic) and Vyvanse to make a direct comparison.  Past me from 2017 and anyone else curious, here&amp;#39;s your answer (and stop pretend flame-flirting with that guy and go to sleep!):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vyvanse lasts about twice to 2.5 times as long as an IR Adderall (and presumably IR dex, may be able to confirm that in the future) and is lovely in its own right but does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; live up to its advertised/marketing promises of &amp;quot;lasting all day&amp;quot;, and due to its idiosyncratic biological &amp;quot;release&amp;quot; prodrug mechanism, it isn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; an &amp;quot;extended release&amp;quot; formulation per se.  Amphetamine in &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; formulation and through any RoA is extraordinarily sensitive to urine pH, dietary intake variables, etc., but &lt;em&gt;all other things being equal&lt;/em&gt;, if &amp;quot;left to its own devices&amp;quot; with minimal intake of foods/beverages that decrease urine pH, and perhaps intake of foods/beverages that  increase urine pH to boost/extend it etc., it lasts about 6-7 hours &lt;em&gt;max&lt;/em&gt;--and on hour 6-7, it&amp;#39;s going to be rapidly ebbing away.  Dex spansules, by contrast, again if taken under optimal conditions and &amp;quot;left to their own devices&amp;quot; (minimal eating of urine-acidifying foods, taken after a night of adequate sleep with no/minimal/reset tolerance on an empty stomach slightly pH-decreased, etc., etc.), can last up to approximately &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; that long.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Duration-wise, spansules &lt;em&gt;deliver&lt;/em&gt;.  This is therapeutically positive for controlling symptoms and/or staying speedy (in the fast lane over longer distances, to belabor the metaphor) throughout the waking day, but it can be problematic when it comes to insomnia.  Booster-dosing with Vyvanse is tricky and inadvisable.  Booster-dosing with spansules is damn near &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt; if you want to sleep that night.  You can take a 30 or 40 mg Vyvanse between 10--11:30pm and be asleep by 6 or 7 (if you take Vitamin C, drink decaf green tea, etc. as you&amp;#39;re winding down).  You can &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; take a spansule in that timeframe and be asleep by early morning.  So plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spansules are smoother throughout their duration of action, and the stimulating action/&amp;quot;high&amp;quot; if you will comes in gentle waves of a sort.  They both kick in in roughly around the same time after dosing, but while Vyvanse has a more gradual onset, once it has fully kicked in, you subjectively get all of it, the peak feeling, which &amp;quot;hits harder&amp;quot; and kicks you in the face at higher doses.  It continues at that level for a few hours and gradually yet rapidly diminishes to the comedown.  No &amp;quot;waves&amp;quot; where you can feel phases of it subtly kicking in hours later to sustain continuity of blood dextroamph level as with spansules (which makes sense given the physical spansule design, with beads going off at staggered times).  It kicks in, you get it, you have it until you don&amp;#39;t, that&amp;#39;s it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the strange thing about Vyvanse--the best analogy is that there&amp;#39;s a gradual gradient on- and off-ramp, but you&amp;#39;re forcefully &amp;quot;pushed&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt; up and down them despite the gradual nature.  Dex spansules, on the other hand, while the on and off ramps&amp;#39; &amp;quot;gradients&amp;quot; feel very similar in &amp;quot;gradient&amp;quot;, which is also a gradual, not steep one--subjectively, the come-up and come-down &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; more gradual because you&amp;#39;re not moving up or down them as quickly, though you do get &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; the on-ramp from the level floor a little faster.  But once you&amp;#39;re on, subjectively you feel the gradual nature of the gradient because you&amp;#39;re not being shoved up it by someone jogging behind you.  That&amp;#39;s an elaborate, weird metaphor but it&amp;#39;s the best way I can describe this and compare the two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because dex spansules act in perfectly-overlapping/synchronized phases to maintain the ER mechanism, &amp;quot;extend the release&amp;quot;, they&amp;#39;re less emotionally-numbing (which can be a good or a bad thing depending upon the reasons you take them), frankly less tweaky, and you don&amp;#39;t get &amp;quot;stuck&amp;quot; nearly as strongly--task-switching is actually possible!  (Who&amp;#39;da thought?)  In general, you feel less &amp;quot;drugged&amp;quot; on them, hence the smoother aspect, because of those slight variations/dips in blood dextroamphetamine level throughout the day they allow you to have.  This is also counterintuitive--but that&amp;#39;s, in the case of spansules, or at least it seems to be, a &lt;em&gt;good thing&lt;/em&gt;.  Having a consistently high blood amph level isn&amp;#39;t better functionally-speaking.  Spansules maintain sufficient amphetamine level in the bloodstream so you don&amp;#39;t come down/crash between the bead-release phases, but those little dips remind you you&amp;#39;re human.  It&amp;#39;s easier to eat.  To interact with other people.  To remember there&amp;#39;s a world outside of your own solipsistic little inner fantasy world/mind awash in chemicals.  To plan and execute different tasks rather than be buffeted by your speedy flighty whims and then inextricably beholden to them for the next several hours.  This is where spansules &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; shine over Vyvanse, IMHO.  Now, it&amp;#39;s not like how people describe low-dose Desoxyn where you don&amp;#39;t even feel like you&amp;#39;re on an amphetamine at all, but it&amp;#39;s a lot closer to that &amp;quot;natural, non-drugged&amp;quot; feeling than Vyvanse is.  Like with Addy, with Vyvanse you&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;on frickin&amp;#39; speed&lt;/em&gt; and there&amp;#39;s no escaping that.  Either you can&amp;#39;t feel it, only get negative side effects at too-low dosages, or you&amp;#39;re speeding hard at sufficient dosages.  There&amp;#39;s a wider window of happy middle ground with spansules.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a (sizable, maybe it&amp;#39;s a huge coconut shell) nutshell, there&amp;#39;s the core of the differences between Vyvanse and dextroamphetamine spansules.  The latter, on balance, are far superior in nearly every way when the doses are truly equal or near-equal.  The main problem is that they can work &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; well--last far too long (it can be useful/nice knowing that with Vyvanse there&amp;#39;s a firmly-defined 6-7 hour max duration limit), and if you&amp;#39;re sensitive to amphetamine or likely to be anxious (if the dose is too high for your tolerance at the time, or you have something else in your system that will interact with/amplify it, etc.), spansules will affect you worse, quicker.  Spansules are more sensitive, naturally, to gastrointestinal pH and that&amp;#39;s a potential downside depending upon diet/lifestyle.  Apathy with Vyvanse was actually a plus for me, but for most people I can&amp;#39;t imagine it would be, but anyway if you want to blot out the world and feel emotionally armored and apathetic without totally frying yourself and still staying within the bounds of oral pharmaceutical amphetamines, Vyvanse works well for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there you go.  Despite the second-person perspective of much of this post that may imply otherwise, caveat that of course YMMV and this is all simply what I&amp;#39;ve garnered from my personal experience and knowledge/conjecture about why these two formulations work the way they do based upon their different designs (physical ER mechanism versus biological/prodrug).  I have to say, everything else accounted for, I&amp;#39;m doing a lot better on spansules (technically dex ER) versus a second daily dose of Vyvanse or even a &amp;quot;booster dose&amp;quot; of IR Adderall (which is tasty and nice to have around for other RoAs (snorting/plugging/sublingual/buccal), but yeesh can that be hardon a girl&amp;#39;s skin/overall physical appearance, and good luck quitting smoking on IR Addy), and I wonder what else I could&amp;#39;ve accomplished and how the last few years might&amp;#39;ve been different had I started with spansules instead of what soon became 70 mg Vyvanse in divided daily doses.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m also not totally disparaging Vyvanse here.  It&amp;#39;s kept me afloat for the past ~3 years and there&amp;#39;s a lot I like about it, namely: I like that it is converted in the body to enantiopure dex (I really like my enantiopure stims).  I like that the marketed/advertised &amp;quot;lower abuse potential&amp;quot; (BS or not in reality) might make certain stingy gatekeeping prescribers who operate on drug reputations rather than drug realities to Rx it where any other form of dex or Adderall/mixed salts might give them pause.  I &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; like that the government pays for it (in my state, at least--and that&amp;#39;s why I continue to stay on it for at least one of my daily doses, as while generic spansules are affordable, I still have to pay out of pocket for those).  ;-D  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, bluntly in the cold light of dawn (after an speeding all-nighter, haha), I&amp;#39;m glad we have it (another pharma amp formulation on the market is always welcome) but Vyvanse was in many ways a failed experiment in unprecedentedly ambitious amphetamine evergreening.  The original company that did the R&amp;amp;D on it, it&amp;#39;s said, was probably aiming for a CIII schedule classification which would make it eligible for refills and easier to prescribe more of, thus increasing profits.  This obviously didn&amp;#39;t pan out, and it really isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;less abusable&amp;quot; unless RoA is the only definition of &amp;quot;abusability&amp;quot;.  It doesn&amp;#39;t last nearly as long as Shire pinky-promises it does, requiring booster dosing for all-day symptom control, and something invented &lt;em&gt;half a century&lt;/em&gt; before has nearly double its duration.  It turns out that having a constant high blood level of dextroamphetamine for several hours isn&amp;#39;t optimal for executive functioning--which is a major facet of the whole reason most people take this stuff in the first place, licitly or not.  It&amp;#39;s not easily soluble in water at all even though Shire insists it is.  It doesn&amp;#39;t even have the convenience of being completely insensitive to gastric pH--in theory it should be, but I swear that it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; less effective when administered with any food in the stomach, and an extra-acidic stomach really blunts/mutes it, maybe not to the extent that it would nullify an IR formulation of dex or Adderall, but yeah.  Spansules were a &lt;em&gt;brilliant&lt;/em&gt;, elegant invention.  Having taken both, I can now say that from a purely consumer, efficacy perspective, that wheel didn&amp;#39;t need to be reinvented--spansules didn&amp;#39;t need to be fixed as they weren&amp;#39;t broken.  Sometimes what&amp;#39;s tried and true works best, and this is just as true in the drug realm as it is with, say, home appliances and newfangled kitchen gadgets.

Using a chain saw definitely provides a strong advantage in many circumstances. Do you NEED to use it? No, you could use a hand saw, or fucking chew your way through the log. 

A difference lies in habit formation. Sure, you could argue that if you have a chain saw and know how to use it, you'll probably not go back to using a hand saw... but you could. And one could argue that the degree to which you're unable to do things without the drugs you're used to indicates how improperly you've been using that tool (doesn't fully map to the chainsaw analogy, but I'd say developing a dependency (rather than say, a ""preference"") is akin to sawing your arm off).

It's quite strange to me that society is so lax with tool use while drugs are frowned upon to the most severe degree.

When I was 20 I convinced my gf at the time to try it at my parents house. She'd never taken drugs. 
Once a few years ago, when mixing it with weed, I heard a growling noise outside and was convinced that, due to my anti big tech comments, Alphabet had sent a terminator to kill me.
The next morning I found out my neighbour had killed the Possum with a golf club. 
I very much enjoyed dancing around my flat listening to psy trance on first plateu, before chilling out letting the music consume me after that. 
I moved to NZ in mid 2018 and at that time Robi gel caps and Vicks dry syrup (i think)  were available at the supermarket. 
Great stuff. 
About a year and a half ago the government restricted dxm products putting them behind the counter. After this it was a matter of answering basic questions from the pharmacist, convincing them the bad cough was from hanging around cigarette smokers, no medications, etc. 
None of the pharmacies seem to carry it any more. 
I suppose the restrictions have reduced demand so much, that it only made sense to replace it with non dam products. 
Perhaps this proves the theory that most dxm consumers are abusers of the product.

Strap in, druggies!

On New Year's Eve this year, I dropped ~175ug of 1P-LSD. I was alone (mistake #1), mostly in the dark (mistake #2), and a bit tired (mistake #3). This was my third time doing psychedelics (the first two being pleasant) so I wasn't too anxious going into this trip.

The come up and some of the peak was fantastic. I was having a great time being transported by the vivid CEVs and where my mind was taking me. There were times where I actually forgot I was in my room. Wild.

Then the music started getting too intense and I think it ruined my vibe. My memory from this period is honestly fucked.

Here's what I do remember:

When I went to the washroom, I was seeing vines growing up the walls exactly like that scene in [Fear and Loathing](https://youtu.be/uOmtVFQ3WF8). This freaked me out since I'd only ever seen general waviness or geometric patterns before. I also felt like time completely stopped around me.

I finally got back to my bed but started feeling extremely painful sensations. It felt like I couldn't breathe because someone was repeatedly stabbing me. This pain was fuelled even further by these constant thought loops. This was the most terrifying moment of my life. I couldn't just let go in this situation. I couldn't even stop moving. I was restless. All I could do was pray (even though I'm not religious) for anyone to save me from the pain. I wanted to die.

Then I recall hearing my voice, but it didn't sound like me. My inner voice was disintegrating every time it spoke. I knew my mind was shutting down. I was desperately trying to communicate with myself. This was unreal. I felt absolutely nothing. Finally, I accepted my fate and gave in to the trip. All of a sudden, I was transported to a bright white room with five other distinct ""copies"" of me. Each copy had its own personality. They were all frantically talking amongst each other trying to figure out how to fix my mind. Maybe this was all just a defence mechanism? But it was okay. I didn't care. This place was serene and warm and a relief from the pain.

I snapped back to consciousness at some point and finished my trip as if nothing happened. When I recorded my experience later on, I started crying. The human mind isn't designed to fracture in this way. Whoever thinks ego death is fun is insane. This was the most traumatic experience of my life and I'm sure I developed mild PTSD from it. Even after 6 months, I still have lasting effects like severe breathing problems when I get anxious. Thankfully I'm in a better place now after some time reflecting on the experience.

Here's what's bothering me, though: I feel like I left something behind in the other dimension. Yeah, I know, it's all mental, but some part of me broke off there. I want to return (on a lower dose) to try to figure out what the hell happened and possibly heal from that experience. Would it be a bad idea to try again?

Also, how did I experience ego dissolution from &lt;200ug?

Same thing with opioids and their opiate equivalents; people will pay as much as $1-1.5 per mg for Opana, but won't pay like $80/g for heroin, even though oxymorphone is stronger than diacetylmorphine (this makes sense if you tested for fent and it came out negative but whatever).

BUT hear me out please! I am thinking about taking maybe about 8-10g of shrooms. i know this sounds like a bad idea but when i take drugs in general not just shrooms it’s EXTREMELY hard for me to get high. opioids have zero effect on me, i can smoke like 5 blunts and still be sober. None of the medicine I get prescribed by my psychiatrist/doctors work. 
Xans and clonazepam have zero effect on me no matter how many i take. Sometimes adderall works if i take a LARGE AMOUNT. It’s impossible for me to even abuse drugs or use then recreational because my body simply doesn’t respond back to them like the average person. 95% of the time i end up having to take like triple the suggested dose just to feel anything. i could take some shit with my friends and they’ll be high off there ass and i’ll be completely normal so I know it’s not the quality of the drugs. I have never had a drug problem other than this one so it’s not because i have a high tolerance problem. It’s always been like this. I can take molly and feel It. that is my go to drug because that’s the only one i can seem to respond back to. i have a blood test next month to see what’s going on with my body and to see if maybe my body isn’t metabolizing substances the way it should. ANYWAYS back to what I was saying. I took a tab of acid the other week and my friend was tripping but i experience nothing. 
I have taken acid one other time and I did trip but that was the first every time. It seems like when i first try a drug i get high but the second or third time i do it again nothing happens as if my body adapts to is so fast but it’s impossible for that to happen after one or two times taking the drug. When i take shrooms l always take about 4.2 grams and my trip is always a trip that would be described as what a person would experience off of 2 grams of shroom. just elevated mood, euphoria , slight visuals and boosted colors. music sounds better. but i can never experience a DEEP TRIP. I want to experience a trip that’s going to make me reevaluate myself and my life. i want to be forced to think about thinks. i want the trip where people feel like a veil has been lifted over their eyes. i have never experienced anything close that. the most grams of shrooms i have taken was about 5.4-6g i can’t remember the exact dosage but still nothing was intense. in fact i barely even felt like i was tripping. What should I do? I want to really experience shrooms like everyone else but it’s really hard. I feel like
maybe i should take 9grams but i know that’s a lot and people usually advise otherwise. i also don’t wanna take too much and regret it and have a bad trip. idk what to do.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,688705,public,confidence,self,"Thinking about taking a heroic dose of shrooms, please give me feedback I NEED HELP.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hevxxp/thinking_about_taking_a_heroic_dose_of_shrooms/,,no_ads,0.0,1593009393.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though there are many varying definitions, to me ego death is permanent. It has the word death in it which is not some temporary state. So if you temporarily during your trip were able to see things from a macroscopic, more objective perspective in which you felt one with the universe and less of a subjective sense of self, that’s wonderful. But if 2 months later, you’re writing a 2 star review of a restaurant on Yelp because your food was delivered late and it “ruined your night,” please don’t tell me you experienced ego death during a trip at fucking Burning Man.

Now if you’re honest with yourself about it and know it was but a temporary experience of ego death, with your ego coming roaring back afterwards, that’s much better.

I often see the ""well aCtUaLlY weed IS adDiCtivE.""  Sure, sure, but it needn't be posted under the guise of intellectspeak every week.  My intent with this post is to stray from that and offer a different explanation as to why weed can be damaging to a person.  Second thing, it's very much worth saying you will not die as a result of smoking weed.  I do not intend to liken the danger-level with say inhalants, street presses, etc., as it would simply be false.  With these things noted, let's get it right out of the way.  


**The reason that weed is often touted as having virtually no side effects is that the only side effects come following return to sobriety.**    


Well, I think in relation to my experience with weed.  What was good about smoking?  What was bad?  I think these thoughts to reflect before my inevitable departure from the smoke scene.  What was good about smoking?  Smoking.  What was bad about smoking... hmm... perhaps the cost, though I can control this.   


""Ahh,"" I realize, ""I've woken up late for work twice over the last month, jeez... I really doubt this would have happened had I not smoked last night.  Jeez, I really don't think I would have smoked last night if I realized that weed isn't aiding in my sleep issues, but abetting them.""  


A few seconds pass.  


""Oh man, on my off days I am so god damn lazy... I'd really like to change this.  I think it's the weed... could it be me and not the weed?  Do I just need to change myself instead of my smoking habits?""  


I've fallen into this trap a few times and it's never one worth perusing.  Just drop the weed if you feel the need to.  Take this as a sign, if you want to quit and **KNOW** you want to quit... then quit, dude.  I know this might seem blunt, but I'm really writing to myself more than anyone.  It's time to just let it go... furthermore I find more power in quitting on my own volition than if I were to run out of weed and scrounge it and be 'forced' to quit; I could buy more, but that's how the buying more happens... running out of weed.  Don't run out of weed, run away from it... **AGAIN, only if you know you want to.** I understand the benefits of smoking and for a lot of people the pros outweigh the cons... used to be for me, not anymore.

Heres my story. I have awful, horrendous anxiety that most people cant comprehend. I have been to the emergency room 21 times in 2018, and about the same in 2019. Its all for panic attacks that give all the exact symptoms of heart attacks. When Im not panicking, Im in a constant state of hyper uncomfortableness, like Im on a bad hit of meth but Im not because I hate stims due to my current condition. Same with coffee,  which I use to love I cannot touch except for that awful decaf. Its humiliating and embarrassing. I run out of jobs and situations with people when these hit and theyv destroyed my life worse than it already was.

I have a special place of hate in my hearts for doctors. They can help me. I Have had some good ones before but they always leave or move. Or losing my amazing job I used to have (Managed a chain of gyms in RIchmond VA&lt; yes, I use to be a big, beefy bodybuilder who took steroids and made lots of money selling PT contracts. It was a dream career and I lost it. Anywanys, I cant take living like this anymore. My lttle 20 month old son is the only thing that gets me going to try to make it. 

You can make fun of me all you want, but this anxiety has gotten so bad I want to end it. Call me a pussy, fine, I am. Iv been in prison for several years, I tried joining the marines but got kicked out for steroids then went away for dealing. I know Im the biggest most worthless person ever.  And yes ,  I know that they are so many other people who want to live and deserve life more than me, trust me. And when I pick up my son, and he loves me just the way I am, even though hes just a little baby boy, I feel so loved. EVeryone tells me how strong he already is and I want to see him  grow to become a man, a good man, someone who doesnt sell drugs, hang with users and dealers and do that horrible street life. Im 28 years old  and if I told you guys the details about my life, you would think Im the biggest loser youv ever met.

For all the people who are about to start flaming me because Im suicidial, you dont know me or my life. I have no way out of the place im in. Maybe if you lived in my shoes you would . I cant move. Im stuck. Im miserable and I feel Ill never amount to anything my son can be proud of except for loving my so unconditionally while hes still an infant.

Okay, enough blabbing. So if anyone here is a doctor or family to one, I know there are good ones but so many I meet are so high and mighty they think they know everything. Trying to get a small prescription where I live in Lynchburg VA, for anything is like trying to pull their teeth out. Im so sick of their antidepressent crap they give me that does nothing but mess up my sex life and make me feel worse! I need a benzo to calm when I have my attacks. They  would rather ( they said this) have me come to the hospital every single time and pay the 1000$ bill just to get an ativan to give me relief. Im at at my whits end. I have all these doctors so much.

Also, people that sue their doctors for giving them drugs like opiates and benzos need to go seriously get the hell out. Its because of people like that, that people like me have to beg and struggle with doctors to even get one simple ativan to take in the moment while my heart rate is almost 200bpm and I cant breath. I seriouly hate doctors so much.

Anyways, I was wondering if anyone knows any kind and compassionate doctors who are more liberal than the dinosurs I have to be around where Im from. Lynchburg, VA.

PM if you could. NOT DRUG SEEKING. I mean I would love to meet a ""dirty doctor""but lol they dont have those out here where Im at haha. No, I just need someone who is kind and compassionnate I can tell my story and show my medical records to.

Do all doctors look at your medical papers when they bring you to a new doctors office or the hospital? Just wondering.

She has no balance and slips and falls in the bathroom while puking. I was really scared but luckily her husband (my uncle) was more or less sober. So he thanked me for watching his kids, and I come back to my place. 

And within 20 minutes my mom comes through the door. Actually, I could hear my stepdad trying to get her up the stairs before she even came in. She opens the door and comes in and she can surprisingly still stand, but has no balance. I was honestly really angry because she’s been looking forward to her wedding for so long and now she’s going to be hungover for the whole thing. I was really mad so I said “You too?” and went to my room. I understand  she’s an adult but you don’t need to be that drunk to have some fun. 

I feel like crying because she used to do this all the time and it brings back some really bad memories but I try to forget all that. She drinks pretty much everyday but usually doesn’t get this drunk. I honestly have no idea why I am so sad and angry but I guess it’s because all the memories I have combined with the fact that I just don’t like it when people get drunk

I should add that my aunt has a 3 year old and a 7 year old which really makes me sad because it reminds me of what I went through which was being scared and confused when stuff like this happened. 

I know it’s her choice and I really don’t know why I feel like this. It’s like I feel bad for her and angry at her at the same time. Does anyone have any experience with stuff like this?

Tried shrooms when I was 16 and I've smoked weed regularly since I was 15. Over the last couple of years I've started experimenting and have had some pretty awesome times, but not really anything worth writing about, until last weekend.  

It's not a crazy trip, it's not the most noteworthy experience, but it was interesting and I feel like sharing it.  

  

I'm back in the town I grew up in due to covid and occasionally meeting up with old friends (lockdown has been lessened somewhat here and bars &amp; restaurants are opening). Well last Saturday I met with 6 of them for a night out, and since I'm not the most extroverted person, decided to take a dose of MDMA about an hour before heading out to lighten things up for myself.  

  

I'm the last to arrive at 8pm and the first effects hit me as I walked in. A couple of great hours go by, I'm just about peaking and we decide to head to another bar to continue this wonderful evening. Since I'm peaking, and I want it to continue, I decide to take another dose.  

  

A few more beers down, some great conversations had, I look at my watch and its 3am, damn, the bars going to close! So I look at my buddy and he's already had the same idea, he calls out to the group that we're going to his for an after party! Epic!  

  

Some of the original group had taken off, some others had turned up, so I didn't know everyone, but I was still feeling amazing, and we were going to my best friends house, all was great! We get there and my friend reminded me he still had some 2c-b left over, GREAT!  

  

So spent the next hour getting to know some new people, everyone is drunk, tripping, rolling, or whatever other inebriation they opted for and I already noticed this one guy who just stood out to me. He didn't seem to know anyone there very well, yet was acting like a bit of a dick. Just generally trying to be the alpha, trying to be the center of attention, a  typical coked out douche. He was also with a girl, but she seemed to be flirting with every other guy in the room.  

  

Time goes by, the 2c-b hits me, I have some pretty intense OEVs and CEVs, faces are distorted, I take a whiff of poppers, I feel a warm wave of euphoric calmness rushing over me, but my mind is still racing on the MDMA inside, but my body doesn't want to move for a couple of minutes. Everything is suddenly made out of the most vibrant slinkies I've ever seen. It's like the fabric of space is made out of slinkies.  

  

I look to my right, and an array of the slinkies start to rearrange their colors into those of human skin, I see a really odd looking face materialize, then I realize it's the douche! I am mostly quite a friendly person, so I try to make conversation. I ask him his name, he looks at me weird and goes huh? So I ask him again, he then replies, oh you do speak Dutch? (My first language is English, but I speak fluent Dutch, though when I'm fucked up I can't be bothered to speak another language so just use English, my friends know and accept this, they'll normally speak Dutch back but sometimes they'll switch to English and often group conversations will turn to English aswell). I try to explain this to douchehead but he isn't having any of it and continues being a douche, telling me I can call him whatever I want. Well without skipping a beat, I go ""Oh, Hey Potato?"" He responds: ""Huh?"" and I completely lose my shit, almost popped a blood vessel from laughing for the next 30 mins.  

  

A few hours later, as the sun starts coming up, my friend lets us know he's working in a few hours and asks us to clear out, so we oblige. I'm the last one out and on my way out I realize theres still someone in the toilet, so I knock, I hear some voices and tell them ""Hey, its time to go!"" No reply. I ask my buddy whether anyones supposed to stay, he comes over and knocks aswell, and the door opens to reveal douche standing in front of his lady friend who is sitting on the toilet sans pants. Now this is a miniscule, toilet only washroom, with hardly enough space for your legs not to touch the door when you're squatting, let alone a (rather large) dude standing in front of you, so as I'm processing the scene, (still tripping) I also realize douche is talking on the phone to someone, ignoring our telling him its time to go. My buddy (not on drugs, drunk and very tired at this point) completely defeated, retreats to the living room and falls on the couch. I see the look of ""Fuck, I'm never getting to sleep"" on his face. As I turn back around to face the toilet, douche walks past me and sits on the couch next to my friend, and the girl is still sitting, pantsless, on the wide open toilet, looking confused. I throw that door closed, stand over douche and tell him to hang up the phone. He is clearly talking to another girl hes ""seeing?"" whos crying and hes making a half assed attempt at consoling her, telling her he'll be home soon and they can cuddle.  

  

I can only handle so much douchebaggery, and this doucheturd had definitely gone too far now. So I hang up his phone for him, and tell him to get up and get out. His first ""excuse"" is him trying to tell me: ""I'm just having a good time man, whats your problem?"" I tell him everyone was asked to leave half an hour ago and I can't even begin to understand what you're still doing here, so just leave. He looks at my friend and starts to give a very bullshitty: oh I'm sorry if we're bothering you, so I cut him off and tell him: ""I don't even really care whether you're bothering him anymore, you're bugging me by how fucking weird you're being and you need to GTFO, now.""  

  

Dude still started to get riled up a bit but his ladyfriend talked him down and they ended up leaving, I walked out at the same time and douche tries to offer me a ride home! No thanks man. 10 min walk home took me a beautiful 45 mins of listening to some Pink Floyd and loving the colors produced from the rising sun and last effects of the 2-cb!",False,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,688669,public,confidence,self,Story time,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hescm1/story_time/,,no_ads,0.0,1592993947.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here is a little background information: my brother is 17 and is one of the most peaceful humans I have ever known. My parents are very anti-drug and pro-police.

This weekend my brother ate 3 hits of acid and basically lashed out against my entire family. Screaming, very aggressive, physically fought my dad, my parents were scared for their safety (may I remind you he is one of the most peaceful and kind person I know). My parents called the cops because he was a danger to himself and those around him and they had no way to restrain him (he is 6'2""). Two cops showed up initially and they called for backup, with a total of 5 cops at our house ultimately. Nobody was hurt during this incident other than my brother, due to the excessive force used to get him on the ground. My parents and brother were told that he was charged with resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct.

Because he was still a danger to himself and others, the cops took him to the hospital and kept him fully restrained. The doctors found out he was experiencing rhabdomylosis- when muscle fluid enters your blood stream. His kidneys were working very hard and they had to flush his system for two days at the hospital. The fact that he had this condition makes me think that he did not take LSD and that it was actually PCP. My parents told the cops that he probably took LSD and my brother also said that is what he took. However, he cannot remember the entire night. He remembers tripping and having visuals in the beginning, but he can't remember fighting my dad, or acting out at all. All he remembers was the beginning of the trip and the end when the cops had him on the ground.

After the hospital he was taken to jail for the night and released the next day on a signature bond. When he was leaving the jail, he was told that he was also charged with a felony- attempted assault of an officer (for attempting to kick an officer and missing by 6 inches). They did not mention this until he was released from the jail. His sentence is 3 years in jail and a $5,000 fine. His court date is in 2 months.

No one I know has been in a situation like this. He can't believe what happened and now he has to suffer the consequences for something he doesn't remember. I understand that it was his choice to take drugs in the first place, but he has done LSD before and nothing like this has ever happened.

Here is my question:

Would my brother be guilty of these charges - battery, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest - if he cannot remember the experience due to the substance he took?

Other information:

He is in Wisconsin and turns 18 in September, his court date is at the end of August.

Also they did not get a blood test to see what drug he took.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,688639,public,confidence,self,Blacked out and charged with attempted battery,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/heqhgc/blacked_out_and_charged_with_attempted_battery/,,no_ads,0.0,1592986735.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I went to rehab for alcohol at the same time and am on numerous meds including SSRIs. So maybe that’s why I feel like my behavior has changed.

Apparently, a sudden drop in blood pressure can cause lack of blood flow to the peripheral nerves which can cause nerve ischemia due to lack of blood flow.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been diagnosed ADHD. My brother was also diagnosed and took the same medication for several years. I sought help for mental problems around a year ago when I first diagnosed bi-polar (I'm 20), and later found that it was most likely ADHD as it fit like a glove.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried non-stimulants first. I also smoke weed. I prefer it over drinking. I was completely honest with my psychiatrist about basically everything because I simply wanted help. After trying the non-stimulants and testing out stimulants and seeing they worked (Adderall obtained from friends with prescriptions) I decided I should buckle down and get stimulants as it wasn't helping at all. However because I revealed my recreational drug use (specifically marijuana) I've been asked to not only be tested to get the prescription but be routinely tested to keep it. I do not want to quit smoking marijuana to get a drug I don't even really want to take to begin with. I'm unsure if I could simply go to a different doctor/psychiatrist in the area and not reveal any recreational drug use. If anyone has any experience with this I could really use some help.

I pair an edible with a suppository, same dose for both, and it provides the strongest relief for my chronic pain. What follows is my recipe for cannabis infused coconut oil suppositories which I have been using every single day for over 4 years now. The effects may be a little intense at first, play it safe and lower the dose for the first time compared to smoking/edible dosage. If you're throwing up your edibles, constipated for some reason so edibles are delayed (opioids in my case), or just want to try an alternative form of cannabis administration, give this recipe a shot.*

# Step 1.) Decarb.

Take wax preferably, but herb strained well with many layers of cheesecloth can be substituted, and decarboxylate according to skunkpharm or however you do it. I like a sealed mason jar burped so it doesnt explode, in the oven at a low temp I can't remember.

# Step 2: Infuse.

If using wax (which is preferable because less particulates), simply melt the decarbed wax into coconut oil. If herb, follow standard recipes. Strain super well if using dry herb.

# Step 3: Mold.

There are two methods I employ. I fill gel capsules with coconut oil, freeze them, open and pull the frozen chunk out of the pill. They sell molds, I didn't particularly find a massive benefit aside from the larger sized chunk of oil compared to the sized 0 caps. Plus, as long as you freeze them before using them you can carry the filled caps or even just swallow them.

# Step 4: Boof.

While laying on your side or hack, shove the frozen chunk as deep as comfortable (second knuckle is where I stop) and hold your cheeks closed for a few minutes while you lay on your stomach.

I was stupid enough to start using when I was late 15 before my brain was fully developed and used for about 2-3 months before finally realizing it wasn’t a good idea and quitting 

The drugs I did were:

- Gabapentin, probably around 7-10 times, friend gave me a bunch for free so I didn’t really look into it, usually around 900-1800mg whenever I used because it subtle and I never felt much.

- DXM, this is the one I’m most worried about, it was obviously appealing since it was cheap, legal and I could literally order it off amazon, used it 5 times at 2nd and third plat within about 2 months.

- LSD, 1 tab, fun but obviously not the greatest idea for a teen with an underdeveloped brain, gave me mild HPPD for while but eventually it went away and is about 99% gone now.

- Phenibut, Kava, Kratom, same friend also gave me these for free since he’d order them in bulk legally, tried them all a couple times but I doubt that any of them would cause any long term issues since they were extremely mild.

Ironically, I never cared enough to try weed or alcohol since they seemed kinda lame, looking back I’m pretty glad about this 

I’m 16 now and haven’t used anything in 5 months and don’t plan to (besides caffeine lol), but ever since using I’ve felt a little bit slower, my vision still has some static and in general I just feel shittier than before I tried anything.

So basically I’m just wondering if any of these could’ve caused lasting damage and if so the best ways to reverse it, also don’t comment if you’re just going to say something like “you’re a dumbass” because I realize that lol.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,688598,public,confidence,self,Question about possible brain damage,0,[],0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/henlvy/question_about_possible_brain_damage/,,no_ads,0.0,1592977016.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1592948454.0,,

Nearly a month ago I moved across country and I’m currently in the process of finding a new doctor. Since December of 2018 I’ve been getting prescribed 30 Adderall 20mg IR every month and a half **w/out** refills. I always have to call or visit to get a refill. 

I recently called my psychiatrist asking if I could get prescribed a 3 month supply. I got a call back from the front desk with a scheduled appointment for tomorrow afternoon. 

My worry is that I sound like a drug seeker even though I’m 2 weeks past the refill date and now calling. 

I’ve wrote out a few things to say to him to convince him to possibly prescribe me a quantity of 90 for the summer. 

**Reason 1:** In the process of finding a new doctor. 

**Reason 2:** I’ll need more in college since my schedule will no longer be taking the Adderall 2-3x a week between homework/being in class. 

**Reason 3:** He won’t have to keep receiving phone calls from me asking for a refill while I’m currently in the process of looking for a new doctor. 

**Reason 4:** Currently taking tests for the college to best suit me with a class that is compatible for me.

I’m still using him as my doctor for trying to up the quantity because if I find a new doctor and ask them for a drastic boost in quantity without even knowing me would look weird.

The throw up was blood red because of the Doritos and I convinced myself that I had just thrown up part of my small intestine and I was going to die.

I then had this weird epiphany where I remember the patterns I was seeing for about an hour being made to loop back around and copy what they originally did. It seemed like I was watching a video and somebody decided to replay it. 

It also seemed like at one point my body was receiving data from this large energy force but I could never quite figure out how to fully access the data flowing into me.

I have a very little addictive personality, tried. Lot of things and never felt any addiction i use in highly moderate dosages and not often.

Was wondering about long term negative effects of xanax use? Im NOT using daily, maybe just once a week or less and only 1mg each time, should i experience any negative effects with this? Absolutely love to combo it with 30mg Ritalin as well, but i do that Even less, more like 1-2 times a month. Should this be fine long term? Thanks for answers.

Also i absolutely know u should not combo xanax with alcohol, but im very good at phasing myself and have no problems with moderation, would the 30mg ritalin+1mg xan and maybe just at Max 2 medium glasses of vine over 1 hour be fine since its such a low dose?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,688580,public,confidence,self,Xanax,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/helma5/xanax/,,no_ads,0.0,1592970602.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I do weed + laughing gas, I often touch my bedsheets and other things because it feels nice, tingly and my body is buzzing. I would compare the tactile sensations to visual noise, they aren’t clear, they feel like they have a noise to them and are sort of blurred.

So I went out with friends, got tipsy, smoked a lot of weed, did snuff tobacco and laughing gas

When I woke up in the afternoon I was still feeling the effects of weed + laughing gas which started to worry me because it has been more than 10 hours since I last had weed or laughing gas. I don’t really feel stoned, just a little maybe and I might be a little bit slower at thinking. The main thing is the tactile sensations as I described above.

When I focus and try, I can get rid of the weird tactile sensations and feel things how I normally feel them. It’s evening now and since the afternoon it got a bit better, I think, but still, when I don’t focus on the feels, they still feel very noisy, buzzy and tingly.

I'm writing this text because I'm concerned about my health. Maybe I'm worrying too much and it will fade away. What do you think? Has something similar happened to you?

Tip 1. Don't argue. We all have rights and frequently they're infringed upon by police. Keep in mind police aren't lawyers and enforcing the law is left up to their discretion. Arguing with law enforcement is suspicious. It will seem like you have something to hide. Not a good thing when you indeed have something to hide. So when and if you are talking to a cop don't argue about things like: how fast you were going, showing ID, where you're going etc. Answer like this information isn't secret. Always be ready to give basic info. The time to argue is in court not the side of the road.  


Tip 2. Appearances can be deceiving. First I recommend that you dress in one of 2 ways. Neatly, for example in khakis and a clean polo shirt or button up. Or dress in very basic clothes. Ditch that NWA T-shirt for a simple white undershirt and jeans. This will do one of 2 things. It will appear that you are as unassuming as possible or that you are a decent upstanding citizen. To quote Aristotle - to avoid criticism do nothing say nothing be nothing. Don't draw attention for yourself. You're judged on appearance unfortunately but dressing nicely or plainly is within your control. I also recommend you keep you car very clean. Inside and out. This way you look like you care. Looking like you give a shit about your self and appearance will lead police to see you as upstanding. It will also appear that when they look through your windows that there are less places for a weapon or drugs to be hidden. Finally music. I recommend not having rap or loud rock music playing. Program in a talk radio station like NPR and have it playing quietly in the background (classical music works too). Cops are way less likely to be suspicious of a person listening to the news than if they're listening to heavy metal of gangster rap.  


Tip 3. Searches. The dreaded, ""you don't mind if I look in the vehicle right?"" Is enough to make your stomach sink right on out your asshole. I try to avoid saying no I have rights or anything of the matter. Your first mistake is riding dirty but for some its unavoidable. I highly recommend having your story straight especially if you have another person in the car. I would choose to say, ""unfortunately officer we need to be on our way so I am going to have to respectfully decline."" If its pushed on you heavily you may have to resort to, ""sir I am going to have to decline the request to search my car."" ALWAYS address an officer as either sir, ma'am or officer. If more intimidation tactics ensue then I recommend you say, ""officer am I being detained?"" If the answer is yes then follow this up with, ""then I am going to have to defer to my lawyer and I am not going to answer any more questions nor consent to a search of criminal or person."" I personally avoid the, ""under the 4/5 amendment...."" Its is very important that you speak clearly and calmly. Do not yell, use profanity or act in any way foolish. Just. Stop. Talking. Because if you have gotten to this point chances are you may be in trouble. Everything is about knowing what to say and when to shut up. And now a word from our sponsor.  


Do you drive around sketchy as fuck in a bad neighborhood after smoking a joint in your car?? Then we recommend you use Boxer Pocket (tm). Boxer pocket is simple. It's a pocket sewn into your boxers so you can keep dope where the sun don't shine so you wont do no time! Simply sew the pocket into your boxers stuff your dope in there and continue being a sketchball!! (\*boxer pockets do not guarantee to save you from all stupidity results may vary\*)  


Tip 4: lawyers. One thing I suggest is finding a couple lawyers in your area (ones that specialize in drug cases) and get one of their business cards. Keep It in your wallet not just saved in your phone. The reason for this is twofold. If you get into a bad situation with the cops you can say, ""under the advice of my lawyer I am choosing to no longer answer questions."" And hand the cop their business card stating, ""if you have further questions please speak to X,Y or Z."" If you end up in jail having that card in your wallet is crucial to being able to contact a lawyer as you wont have your phone. The other thing I recommend is getting a close friends # as well as a bail bondsmans # (or 2). This way your not completely fucked if you end up in the big house.  


Tip 5. Rules of the road. I recommend that if your driving dirty that you drive the speed limit or just barely over it. In a 35 drive right at 36 or 37 mph. Don't go too slow you want to appear that you aren't high or driving recklessly. Obviously never ever drive drunk or high. But careless driving will get you pulled over eventually. Drive with your hands at 10 and 2. If you see a cop in your rear view mirror don't stare at them or begin to act sketch. Just continue about as it you weren't being followed (it's easier said then done). Use turn signals EVERY TIME YOU TURN. I recommend you get in the habit of doing this. You'll be much less likely to be pulled if you do. Always come to a complete stop even if you don't think a cop is around. If you're driving on the highway then try to stay in a ""pod"" of cars. You don't want to be a lone car on the highway you want to be part of a pack. Keep a car behind you so that a cop cant get behind you. If you do get pulled over then turn your blinker on and pull over safely and quickly. Don't ever ever speed up or make multiple turns looking for a place to pull over. You need to be safe and swift so you do not look like your running away or hiding something.  


So these are 5 tips that I use often. The driving advice has kept me from never getting a ticket in 10 years. I know that right now is a volatile time and I 100% stand for policing reform I want people to stay safe and out of jail and prison. If you guys have any other tips please post them.

I have some questions regarding my experience which I hope y'all can answer. Here's a blow by blow retelling of what happened.

12:30 pm - First ingestion, 50mg pill on an empty stomach. I expected it to kick in within 30 mins.

1:30 pm - I feel slight excitement, probably placebo effect  because I'm not feeling any change in heartbeat etc. So I ingest another 50mg pill hoping desperately for it to work. 

2:00 am - finally the effect kicks in, my limbs are feeling light and there's this muffled feeling in my ears and slightly increased pressure in my head. 

3:30 pm - the effect is at its peak, I'm feeling light and happy almost as if sedated ( I'm sure tramadol is a stimulant and not sedative ) my neurons are super active and I feel every stroke of air against me intensely. My muscles are twitching and I feel a slight fever. 

5:00 pm - feels like I'm riding a hammock in heaven. My neurons are firing at maximum and I almost had a heart attack from a text alert. Still feeling cold and shivering

6:00 pm - I'm starting to feel the effects wear off and am feeling warm again. 

Even a while later I was feeling the ripples from this amazing experience. Strangely around 3 hours later I found it difficult to get a boner from porn and didn't feel the urge to jerk off one bit, I tried anyways but I couldn't get very far..felt almost as if I'm forcing myself to do it. 

Are these effects common? Or did I experience something unusual out of the bunch? Any explanation as to why I couldn't feel anything from the first 50mg dose?

I've been using pregabalin from 225mg-450mg on average twice a week for three months now.

I use because I have inattentive ADHD and currently don't have my dexamfetamine medication because the clinic closed at lockdown and I needed physical check up by the rules...so pregabalin is helping to give me energy, work out and complete housework a couple times a week.  It's nice to be on top of things and have a tidy house.  The energy I gain is insane and always used productively. 

However I'm unsure of whether I could gain side effects as most info is for daily use.  I haven't seemed to build *any* tolerance and get the same effect every time.  I also haven't noticed any side effects but I'm aware people often don't notice them initially.

With all this time I have and having nothing to do, I wanted to share my experience while on MDA, It might be a long read but I’d figured I’d share my experience with you guys just in case anyone wanted to know what it is like or thinking about trying it for their first time and wanted a heads up to whats to come of it. ( DISCLAIMER. I do not endorses or recommend the use of drugs. I figured I’d just share my experience for educational purposes)

	So at my old job we got this new guy Bob ( not his real name ) On the first day Bob and I got to talk a lot and became friends. Well couple days later I told him how I like to trip and experiment with Psychedelics. After that he told me many story’s of his trips and times he went to raves and he mention MDA, and how its crazy. Ive never heard of MDA before and didn’t know what it did, but he said he had more at home and that he give me some. So later that day I went to Bobs place and got a gram of it. Before I left Bob told me hope much I should take since it was my first time trying it and split it up in three different bags ( 2 were the doses he recommend for me and my girlfriend.  And the 3rd bag was what was left over ) the two bags were scaled out to 250mg’s. Bob told me to make sure I text him through out the night and to let him know if I have anymore questions or to just call if I was getting scared. He was a really good guy. 
	Anyways I get home with my girlfriend and it was around 11pm and thats about the time everyone went to sleep and we were going to drop at that time but we were hungry so we went and got food real quick and my girlfriend got a Gatorade too, the red kind ( this will be important to remember ) So we got back home and we ate while talking to my younger sister. After words my sister went upstairs and after we were done eating me and my girlfriend took the MDA 250 mg’s each. But my thing was that when I try something I like to take more of whatever it is and have it hit hard. So I ended up opening up the third bag and taking another 250mg’s. So i took 500 mg’s while my girlfriend at 250 mg’s. We were both excited and couldn’t wait for it to kick in. I texted Bob and told him we just dropped and that I took more. He laugh called me crazy and told us to have fun rolling. 
	Me and my girlfriend were just chilling on my bed watching YouTube ( Adult swim off the air videos, I highly recommend you watch them! ). Anyways we looked at each other and it was crazy how fucking big our pupils were. ( This was about only 30 mins. We dropped at 11:30 and it was 12:00am at this time. ) Then my girlfriend was starting to say how she could feel her body as if she was not in it. I still wasn’t feeling anything yet. Then out of no where my girlfriend threw up her food and the Gatorade. I WAS SCARED AF, because when that happened it all came out red and thought she threw up blood. I started to feel scared and freaked out while I had my girlfriend stay on the bed while i cleaned up the mess real quick. I kept asking if she was okay and if anything hurts but she was zoned out and didn’t answer me. After I finish cleaning I came back and she finally started to answer me, in this really slow speaking quite voice. She said she feels okay but is tripping hard as fuck and just keeps feeling like she’s leaving her body. She was sweating so much but kept on saying she was cold. So I wrapped her in a towel and wrapped her in a blanket over the towel. She was just sitting there not saying anything blank out, it just seemed like she wasn’t there anymore.
	But this is when it started to hit me, out of no where I no longer felt my body, as if was numb. I started sweating really heavy but felt great at the same time. It felt like an acid trip. But I was still freaked out about my girlfriend because she threw up so I wasn’t really thinking about it to much because I was worried. But then she finally said something again. She goes “ babe relax, remember I had red Gatorade thats why it came out red. Please stop worrying and enjoy this.” And after that she went completely quite. I felt better because i forgot about the Gatorade. This is when i started to notice how I felt and I started to get really cold but still sweating. At this time we pretty much had the chitters ( when you are so cold your mouth starts yo chitter, best way i can explain it lol sorry. ) We both sat there quite as fuck for about 30 mins. I suggested we go outside and sit on the porch because it was a full moon so it wasn’t completely dark and it was super warm outside. So we put our sweatshirts on with sweatpants and went outside. 
	Once we were outside we were on the porch sitting on the lawn chairs that would lean back. We were staring at the sky and thats when I noticed, the sky looked different and the clouds were moving crazy and making these images. I asked my girlfriend if she could see that and she said no. I then realized I’m starting to trip fucking balls. My girlfriend wasn’t seeing anything she just felt out of her body. She was confused on why I was tripping so hard and she wasn’t, I was confused too. But about 20 mins later I was looking at the trees, and I saw these tree houses and bridges to from tree to tree with people walking across them and building more. It looked so fucking real and I have never experience anything like this. I was telling my girlfriend what i was seeing as its all happening. She was assumed and just kept telling me, “ remember its not really there, there’s nothing there.” So we stayed outside for another 2 hours because I couldn’t believe what I was seeing and how this is actually happening, that I’m seeing such real life looking visuals. 
	We decided to go back inside ( it was about 3:30-4:30 at this point maybe I honestly lost track of time and forgot what time was at this point. ) We get up and as we are walking to the back door I see these two people in my backyard, taking pictured of me with cameras that had flash. I got confused on why these two guys were in my backyard and why they were talking pictures. I said what the fuck? And my girlfriend asked “what baby?” And after she said that I yelled “ Get the fuck out of my backyard why are you guys back here taking pictures what the fuck?” My girlfriend was really confused and asked “ baby who are you talking to are you okay? Whoa re you talking too?” And then I said, you dont see those guys right there?! Taking pictures of us?! She then said “ baby there is no one there, i promise you there’s no one there. You are just tripping really hard. There’s nothing there.” I didn’t believe her at first but then I had to remind myself that I am tripping and that I am just seeing these things. I claimed down after that and decided to walk up to these people. They didn’t move at all but it looked so fucking real. As i got closer, pretty much face to face, the disappeared and tuned into little beams that were coming down from the sky. I just thought to myself this is fucking crazy and we went back inside my room downstairs. 
	At this point my girlfriend was feeling like herself again and was doing good. On the other hand though I was still tripping hard, sweating really hard and still felt so cold. So i took my shirt off. Girlfriend put a blanket over me and we sat on the bed just talking at this point. I dont know if it was because of the MDA or because i thought something bad was going to happened to my girlfriend when she threw up ( when it looked like blood ) but we just talked about how we love each other so much and that no matter what we’ll always be there for each other. About 30 mins go by and we figured we lay in bed and try to relax and maybe sleep the rest of it off. 
	But when I laid down I saw like millions of little bugs that looked like worms with tinny legs crawling all over me and my girlfriend. I jumped off the bed telling my friends. GET OUT OF THE BED THERES BUGS EVERYWHERE. She looked confused and i was confused on why she wasn’t getting off the bed. She then told me “ theres no bugs, theres nothing” I didn’t believe her, it just looked so real. After she kept telling me many times “ remember you are just tripping dont freak out it’s just the MDA messing with your head. I finally came back and kept telling myself it is just a trip. At this point the bugs stayed there all over my bed and they jumped off my girlfriend once she got out of the bed. I stared at them amused that I’m really see this. I would out my hand over the bed and the bugs would climb onto each other trying to reach me and if i would walk a little away From the bed they would make a bridge out of them selfs trying to reach me ( like how ants do to reach another area ) Then I saw a cricket spider. Me thinking it wasn’t real I wanted to splat it and see if it just goes through my hand or just disappear. Well this is when i slapped the bug hard against my hand and bed and realize it wasn’t fake. My girlfriend yell “ BABE YOU JUST KILLED THE CRICKET SPIDER” I just sat there with this now dead bug all over my hand laughing my ass off. I couldn’t get over that i just did that. My girlfriend brings me upstairs and I washed my hands ands went back down stairs and got in bed. All those tinny bugs were still there but I just got over it and just accepted that they are going away until i sober up. 
	At this point we were pretty much going to sleep and pretty tired. I stoped sweating but i was still super cold. I’m pretty sure my girlfriend passed out but I couldn’t sleep because when I would close my eyes, I was having some of the craziest visuals. Soon after I ended going to bed. We woke up maybe around 3-4pm and we honestly felt really good. There wasn’t like no hang over nothing. Just felt normal again you can say Lmao. 
	This was probably the craziest trip Ive had because these visuals looked so real, like the way the bugs looked, the people outside and the tree houses. But this was defiantly an experience I was happy i tried. Me and my girlfriend wanted to try it again but we wanted to wait couple weeks before we did but at that point Bob moved and we didn’t know anyone. So we just tool the experience we got from it and happy that we got to try it. 

I hope you guys liked my story of my experience on MDA and hope this helps you guys have a little more information on this stuff.

Will have tldr)***

**Back story**

I've been around weed my whole life. I'm attracted to ""stoners"", literally all my friends smoke regularly. I used to partake with friends but quickly learned my limits. Taking anything heavier (bong hit, grav hit, sharing a full blunt) would make me feel similar to a half balloon whippet **body** high. Feeling like I'm sinking, waves of body tingles, ect. Not much **mind** trippy except some bad anxiety that was hard to battle. I have diagnosed ocd and social anxiety, so it was no surprise that my anxiety at the time was about the people around me and tended to loop. I just chalked it up to me be ""hyper sensetive"" to thc, that the risk wasn't worth the reward and stopped smoking. 

My boyfriend and I are very happy so im comfortable enough to be high around him and not get so anxious. I've been stressed recently (thanks covid) so I've been taking the little tiny amount of smoke left after my boyfriend hits a dab. Usually, this just make my mind feel very slow and giggily, and a body high similar to benzos (I feel soft and relaxed but got no damn balance) but I'm still very very high. I would say my tiny hit puts me at the same level as him if he takes maybe three dabs back to back. It was very pleasant and helped with my anxious feelings. 

**Story here**

I've done acid atleast 15 times. Shrooms maybe 5 times. Dxm. Whippets. Basically, I'm not shy of psycdelics and throughly enjoy tripping.  Last night, I got cocky and took a regular sized dab hit. It was literally the most intense thing I've ever experienced. Way surpassed any acid or shrooms trip. I felt like my mind and reality were two separate entities, and I got caught in an endless loop trying to reconnect. But the harder I tried to relax and understand I was just high, the harder I would get stuck in the loop. Then realizing that I was just freaking out because I was looping would make me loop again because the loop was my reality. I could not stop the loop. It lasted for an hour and half, just the same exact thoughts over and over. I knew I was having a panic attack but because reality was seperated, I didn't matter. I wasn't in reality. I was getting sharp pains in my head, my legs and hands where shaking, and thought and I was having a sezuire. Any movement or sound would send waves that felt like low FPS on a PC through my body. No visuals or auditory halincations. Just all in my head. Nothing could bring me out of it. My boyfriend put on a calm show and cuddled me, but I was incapable of understand the show to let it distract me. I ended up having to take two Xanax to knock me out to end it. After a couple hours I woke up and I was still high but back to the mostly pleseant high, but still ended up vomiting and going back to sleep. 

I'm telling all you fellow druggies out there that with my all expirence this was absolutely the most intense thing I've ever experienced. Even with acid and shrooms I understand that I am high. While thoughts about reality, ocd, and anxiety happen they are apart of the trip expirence. I understand that they are apart of me, and I have to understand them. The drug is just helping. With this, I wasn't there. It couldn't help me because I was no longer attached to reality. 

**Question**

So after this expirence I did some googling to see if anyone else is like this with weed. I found an [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-019-0639-7) that suggest that some people with a certain gene expire TCH in an entirely different way, similar to dreaming. Do any of you relate to this story? Did you stop smoking or have you figured dosing out? 

**TL;DR** Any amount of THC I consume has a psychedelic like effect. Found an article that suggest many people are this way. Was curious about other people's expirences and how they deal with it, or don't.

This was my second 2CB trip, my first being 20mg in a pressed pill.  I insufflated 45mg as my stomach is too weak to eat 2CB (always waste it). 


12:00pm - I took my first dose. My 2CB was in capsules so I snorted the majority of its contents, reconnected the two sides and swallowed it to get what was left around the inside. The pain of it wasn't half as bad as I had expected/seen described so your mileage may vary - if you've ever had a nose piercing it's similar!

12:10pm - I vomit and begin to buzz with a powerful, nervous energy alike to waiting in line for a particularly intimidating rollercoaster. A honeycomb-like grid forms over my vision and colours distort - I have a mandala tapestry in my front room right in front of me which is equal parts blue, purple and white. The white becomes grey and the blue and purple are incredibly pronounced.

12:20 - The trip kicks in at full force with the typical spinning, swirling and melting intense RC visuals. I see geometric patterns and art in everything and tracers are so strong that if my eyes travel across the room, I see four or five scenes from it at once overlapping like long-exposure (?) photography. Some aspects such as me waving my hand produce an oblong skin-coloured shape across my vision rather than a hand!

I always receive bodyload on psychedelics - even very low doses of LSD - so prepared beforehand with an assortment of supplements including green tea, ginger and magnesium. Still, the bodyload here is the second most intense I've ever experienced with the first being NBOMe. I'm stiff, seizing and violently shaking alongside stomach discomfort. I also cycle between thinking I need bodily functions - horny, need to urinate, need to vomit etc (I didn't actually need to do any). This was manageable but very uncomfortable so I wouldn't encourage a dose like this in a heavy social or party setting.

I also experience leg stiffness that I've only ever experienced on a high dose of 25i-NBOMe, so don't know if this is related to 2c/its derivatives. 

1:30pm - As I finally start settling into the trip (and not needing to vomit from visuals!) the stimulating, empathogen side of 2CB becomes very apparent. At one point I get upset because my sober boyfriend is looking at his phone instead of hugging me! Luckily 2C seems to eradicate negative feelings as quickly as they come so within 30 seconds or so I was fine 😂

I'm driven by a need to move; partially by the buzzing, aroused energy still flowing through me. I feel stimulated on every facet possible and hold an excitement or wonder for the world not unlike a pleasant LSD trip. I try to engage in solo sex, try listening to some jungle and then just explore the house and my visuals fully as my attention span is too short for the former activities. 

2:00pm I take a bath. This is noticeably easier than it was on LSD or mushrooms as on those psychedelics I often feel like I forget the motions of simple tasks such as this. On 2CB I get there with relative ease (granted after having to wait to come down a little off the peak!) however while in the bath I do notice I have a more introspective mindset than expected from this drug and can entertain myself thinking for a good while - this is presumably due to dose as I had NO 'trippy' headspace from my 20mg oral trip.

I also noticed I could hear humming frequencies and noises from things I could never hear sober, as if I'd become superhuman. Moving water sounded beautiful not unlike shattering glass or chimes. 

Around 3:00pm I take another 15mg which kicks my visuals back intensely but does not bring back the bodyload half as bad as it was initially. The movement of the room is also a lot less jarring this time so even though my visuals are VERY strong I feel much more comfortable and settled. At this point I engage in oral sex with my boyfriend which eventually falls short as every time I try - especially if my eyes are closed - I'm smashed with a wave of colourful fractals. I do wonder how much of a 2CB trip is influenced by outside stimuli as it seems to dip in and out of intensity depending on what I'm doing or where (even at this dose I felt almost bone sober smoking a cigarette outside!).

Redosing seemed to work perfectly and afterwards I wind down, eat something (eating kebab while tripping is impossible; I nearly turned into a cave woman) and let it die off, using poppers every now and then for a 20-30 second reminder of the lingering visuals.

POSITIVES:  manageable headspace, euphoria, increased tactile sensation, sparkly attractive visuals even at lowish dose, pleasantly stimulating, body high which some people will like, sound distortion and enhancement great at high dose, 

NEGATIVES: bad and painful bodyload even in low doses for some, nausea (vomiting at medium to high doses), won't make *all* music sound good like many trips/empathogens, relatively short if insufflated, uncomfortable comeup and erratic unpredictable intensity 

I'd recommend 15mg insufflated for an experienced tripper for social use as I found this had quite an intense comeup but beautiful visuals, nice music enhancement and I chatted articulately for hours on end!

meaning we should be able to post about any DRUG we want... right? 

people like us (drug users) are already demonised and put down by the rest of society enough as it is, we don’t need druggies turning on eachother 

it’s all well and good that you only smoke weed on weekends and do mdma once a year John but that doesn’t make you any more of a human being than Tabatha over there in the corner huffing paint fumes with fent patches on her arms on a daily basis

it doesn’t affect you at all what drugs some random stranger online puts in their body, be it weed, meth, acid, heroin, dxm WHATEVER 

let’s just all be friends, if you see someone post or talk about a drug ‘you don’t approve of’ then just simply ignore it, don’t post hate, don’t downvote (unless it’s on a sub in which the drug in question isn’t relevant) - just be a decent fucking person and realise that each and every person is different and has their own personal preferences regarding their D.O.C

My childhood friend recently asked if I could drive him into town every once in a while, and he would go into a gas station to meet some friends and then come back out high off his ass. Like an upper high, where he was smiling ear to ear, and skipping down the street back to my car. So eventually I asked him if I could get in on the fun, he was very hesitant but said yes only if I did it with him. He told me it was percs, I’ve never done them but was ok to try. I’ve don’t know what percs look like, but he pulled out this light brown powder, (some small chunks), out of tin foil, and we smoked it out of the tinfoil with a straw, he told me to hold it in forever, and it hit me almost immediately. My whole head and a lot of my body just felt euphoric, it was amazing, and about 30 minutes later I took another hit, same feeling, accept this time after about 15 minutes I was nodding off having a hard time trying to stay awake. I did stay awake fine, but could have easily fallen asleep literally anywhere.

Cocaine, amphetamine, benzos, alcohol, mdma, and now i started shooting heroin. I bought 0.5g i shot 13 shots before i was out so like 35mg of #3 with asorbix acid in it. I still feel it but the effects are not at all what they were. How do people use this for years. 

I wqs close to overdose yesterday, had to remind myself to keep breathing cus i would stop and almost faint. Today i did 250mg in one shot. It was intense but lasted almost no duration. I basically am hyper on it. Not even bedridden like i thought i would be on H. Its not that euphoric.

My dopa receptors are fucked from shooting up to 3g of amphetamine at once for half  year. Been using speed for 8 years.

Im super angry and irritated on heroin. Its working tho, i cant pee, i cant cum, i cant poop. I cant sleep on it tho due to waking up everytime i nod. Extremely annoying. I found every night im approaching psychosis for some reason. I feel energetic when on it aswell sometimes. My brain is extremely foggy and memory and cant think properly.

Im gonna do a tolerance break im obviouslt addicted i know that already. I have extreme rashes everywhere its super itchy. I barelt have euphoria too, prob xus np dopamine. 

Im aware i probably got bunk shit, im going to rehab in two weeks. Im worried that i will regeet not using enough drugs before i go there tho. No drugs work on me. Not even alcohol.i barely get naesos on heroin. Only once was i close to puking, after that i havent been naesous. The H doesnt even last more than an hour. But i can nod and i cant masturbate at all even 10 hrs after dosing. 

Is it possible to get an insane tolerance in 4 days? I used 750mg in like 20 needles.

Anyway first time withdrawing from h. At this point im having it for every meal. So breakfast is H ans cigs.

My husband: was a recovering heroin and meth addict before me. Relapsed three months ago, went to rehab, was sober two months, relapsed again. I’m staying at a friend’s house. He tells me he is making 3 grand a week selling drugs. He lies a lot, but somehow he has money in his account. I tell him things are over. He sends me a voicemail begging me to take him to rehab. I don’t see it for days.



Last night I went to his place to check on him. He’s nice, then mean. I saw a back pack full of bags of powder, like tied up white trash bags with golf ball sized lumps. I grab the bag containing these bags and try to flush it down the toilet. It won’t flush. He’s desperately fighting me but then stands back while I take the stuff out. I disgustingly rip the bags open with my teeth and dump the contents out. It’s white and bubbles in the water. It tasted like detergent.



Then I see my husband is hiding a container in his pocket and didn’t seem to care that I flushed the stuff down. I dice for the container and spend ten minutes wrestling it away. It’s clear, the size of a sugar bowl, and filled with brown powder. He’s clawing at me. I get it and dump it in the toilet. He’s angry and storms off onto the balcony. The stuff I dumped into the toilet, I think it was coco powder. Smelled like it and filled the air. I flushed it.



While he’s out in the balcony, I toss the room and in between cushions I see another plastic bag with the same white trash bags. There’s about four of them, the size of walnuts. I dump them in the toilet. It smells like coco powder again. 




My husband flips out. He blocks me from leaving. He calls up someone “big frank.” Asks this guy if he can stash some “black” at his house. The guy seems mad. My husband says “no I’m not asking for stuff, I’m asking you to hold stuff for me.” I run out of the house. 




My husband blows up my phone. From different numbers. Sends me four messages: “I’m scared please answer.” “I’m in so much trouble.” “I think I’m going to turn myself in.” and “please call I’m freaking out.” 


I ignore the messages. Just the week before he called me about an emergency with our cat just so i would answer. I knew it was bullshit so I took the cat away from him. I’ll play games if he plays them. He loves that cat but the cat is safe with my friend. 




I see in his Venmo account that he said someone named Darren, and the memo said “big frank.” So I call Darren (I know who Darren is. Darren said he only uses weed, wasnt with my husband. I call my family and call legal assistance at my work. 



Today I call Darren again. He says that he had gotten mad last night because my husband had called him up “tripping out.” Told me that he didn’t know my husband did hard drugs. (Darren was a former coworker, ive met him several times). He seemed mad because he spent a lot of time doing favors for my husband. Seemed upset when I mentioned my husband had a lot of money. I told Darren what I did, about flushing stuff. Now Darren says that I shouldn’t have done that, that my husband might be in a lot of trouble. 



My husband’s phone is off. It’s not connected to WiFi. If it was on, I could see if he was home or not. 



I’m losing my mind over here. It’s hopeless.

My (22F) boyfriend(25M) has serious issues with cocaine, and it has been going on for waaaay too long. I’m desperate. I really do not want to lose him over drugs, because I see the man behind the addict and want to help him.
So the thing is, he has been using it for about a year now.. Successfully hiding it from me most of the times, but time to time, I found some little bags etc, he always said they are from a long time ago etc, so one weekend we took the time and cleaned up our whole apartment and got rid of all his drug related trash. It was about a month ago. Now I found some more again, and he admitted, that he has been doing it still. 
I told him, the only way, we will stay together is that he will seek professional help. I told this to him about 5 months ago, he got extremely mad, and said he is able to control it himself. Apparently that is not the case. So this time, he promised me to get professional help.
I’m so disappointed, and feeling betrayed, that he was always borrowing money from me, because he spent all his money on cocaine. I didn’t mind borrowing him money, because I knew he has a lot of debt, and didn’t even come to my mind that he even has the money for it.. I feel used, but I also know this is an extremely addictive drug and he probably can’t stop doing it without help.
I’m just struggling with dealing with this whole situation, it is mentally exhausting to worry about him all the time.. 
is there any spouses who went through a similar situation? I would really love to talk about it with someone because I can’t share it with anyone I know and it is so frustrating... 😔

I’ve had meth/adderall fap binges for the past few years, about once or twice a month.  I’d snort or plug 50-100mg of ice, eat some cialis, light up a fat dab and sit in my bed with two laptops running porn on either side of me, and an iPad on a tripod right in the middle streaming Pornhub on autoplay.  It appeared as if I was playing a flight simulator - using my dick as a joystick, furiously beating off and waiting for my jizz to liftoff.

I would watch so much porn while flying high, even VR porn, which took my fap sessions to a whole new dimension.  It was GoonChella, and each video screen was a different fuck stage which I went back and forth, while stroking it hard w/ a fleshlight up and down.  I’ll spare you the details, but needless to say, over the course of a year, there wasn’t a spot within a 3 foot radius that wasn’t yellow, wet, or crusty.

Fast forward to Covid-19 quarantine life, I had conveniently used up all my stims, ran out, and found out that my plug had dried up.  I thought, oh well, guess I’ll just smoke weed and beat off the old-fashioned way.  

After even watching the most depraved shit online, porn just didn’t have the same grasp as it did before.  At first, I was saddened that my favorite pastime didn’t appeal to me anymore, but as the days progressed, I realized that in lieu of porn, I’ve had much more free time to chase other hobbies, like build RC cars, make music, and video games.

I’d hate to say it, but meth cured my porn addiction - something i’ve had since I was a horny teenager, some 25+ years ago.  It’s been 3 months and I don’t miss porn (or meth) at all.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,688433,public,confidence,self,Meth cured my porn addiction,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/he8oe2/meth_cured_my_porn_addiction/,,no_ads,0.0,1592918684.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tried ALOT of drugs in that span as I started with cannabis at 15 a few months before 16yrs. Started it for my acute eye glaucoma or eye retinopathy. Very painful shit (feels like your eyes are being vacuumed into your skull.) cannabis completely reverses it in my experience. Tried alot of psychedelics and a dissociative DXM. Dxm was/is a favorite of mine as its very unique and have had many different experiences on my 60ish+ trips. Found this to be the easiest psychedelic to maintain shots and shit as its has anesthetic qualities to make shots painless. Didnt really fuck with my bloodsugar except fot initial spike using delsym syrup. CWE delsym fixed that along with gel caps.

Psychedelics like shrooms +analogs and LSD and DMT. Those are more difficult as if you take to much it can be IMPOSSIBLE to do shots or check blood sugar. Definitely NEED a educated trip sitter to manage your sugars and shots. Many times while on LSD it can feel like your sugars are rapidly dropping even though they arent. But LOWS while peaking on shrooms or acid is one of THE most intense psychedelic experiences ive had. As you are basically in early stages of dying when you go LOW. So that intense blood sugar drop on a peak REALLY takes you out of body, quite litterally. DMT is actually much much easier to trip alone on. You can control the trips time and intensity so you can always make sure your blood sugar is good while tripping. Dont really need a trip sitter except for your first n second time trying.

Opiods and stimulants. Opiods are chill for the body and dont fuck with blood sugar really and I find I am more responsible with checking sugars and doing shots on em as they are painless. Not gonna go on bout addiction n shit as this is for diabetic usage. But they arent always the best on the liver which isnt that good as your liver already processes a ton of drugs like short acting and long acting insulins. So its best not to use for long term and to take breaks. Stimulants arnt my type. Dont have much experience with em other than Nicotine, caffeine, and Ritalin. Never experienced much side effects from em but I probably wouldnt suggest using alot of stimulants as a diabetic. But I cant really say. If any type 1 has more experience with em I would love to hear about them so I know what they do to the diabetic body.

Anyways thats about all my experience with drugs as a type 1 diabetic. Any responses from type 1s or even type 2 diabetics would be much appreciated!

I know I can't do this all my life but I'm not sure how Il get out of this cycle. I take benzos daily and smoke weed daily. I like to take pretty much any drug. From dph to nutmeg, Dramamine, mushrooms, MDMA, lsd, lsa etc. I've tried just about everything and anything there is to try. I always find something cool about any drug experience, and once I try something and like it I'm hooked. I get addicted to things easily and have little to no self control when it comes to taking them. Ive lost almost all of my friends due to my drug abuse, nobody wants to be around me because half the time I just slur and make little sense to others. Being honest, I'm scared of being sober. I feel like shit when I'm sober and have no motivation or fun in life. Nobody can change my life but me and I know that. The last few years I've been going downhill but I'm not too worried. I've had this sort of voice in my head that always tells me "" Just keep taking drugs and having fun, it will kill you one day but atleast you will live life how you want to. I live by that voice. Im a drug Addict, I love drugs and I've already accepted the fact that il die that way too. On drugs lol. Sorry if this made no sense. Just wondering if anyone out there feels the same way as me.

I was hanging out with a good buddy of mine, Max, and he turned me on to dxm and soon me and him were consuming it regularly, and we would go on some crazy misadventures like We would make a whole day out of going from town to town stopping at all the stores that sold cough&amp;cold coriciden or generic versions and take every box they had didnt matter if it was 1 or 12 they all went out the door with us.

 Looking back this was a highly reckless act but we thought we were invincible/untouchable in a way lol and we would be tripping the whole time taking anywhere from 16 to upwards of 32 pills.

 One day we went on one of these adventures and as a side journey we decided to go to a couple head shops and see what cool pieces they had. We stopped at one store and they had some glass pipes we really wanted but had no money, so I got the idea we should go steal clothes from retail stores and take them to this store that buys clothes for cash and then we will have money for some pipes. We ended up going to a mall and taking a bunch of stuff and then we go to the store to sell them and they had just close like seconds before we pulled up. Devastating. 

So we decide to head on back home and we go to our mutual friends house out in the country, which was pretty much a party house (smoke weed, take pills, get drunk, damn near anything goes.) I was staying the night there this particular day and after hanging out awhile my friend Max ends up leaving and I'm hanging out and tired yet still tripping balls , fully peaking for hours on end it seems, (if you've never used dxm like the best maybe worse way to describe, for me, is like a weird combination of acid and shrooms , just frying my ass off ""this is your brain on drugs"" with the eggs sizzling in the pan type shit.)
 I fall asleep on the hard floor in a plank position with just a cough cusion pillow, and my buddy T was there and he said I every so often I would left my head up and stare at the floor/pillow then lay it back down, says I did this several times (still don't know why),
 I'm not sure how long I was passed out but it was dark out when I fell asleep,and when I woke up  the Sun is shining, birds chirping, its a brand new day. But something is off.. I'm still tripping balls and this had never happened before. I was still in the oven cooking at 420°F , and I consulted my friends over this asking ""is this normal?!""  which they didn't fuck with dxm as hard as I would so they didn't know either , and it's like I'm still in a dream state yet consciously aware almost too aware.. 

 Max ends up coming back over and he had somehow almost miraculously went back to the town an hour away to sell the clothes and buy like 6 different pipes, which I couldnt  wrap my mind around how he pulled that off, and he was high as shit too still lol and yeah I would just like to finish with I haven't been right since lmao like I've still kind of been tripping this whole time 10 years later 👽✌

And i honestly think i show that all the time, and believe i am a pretty decent boyfriend. However, i want to show her anyway.

I just find it hard to do it, when i think she’s arguing for an unfair point. But i really want to do it anyways, to save our relationsship.

I want to take them before work to make the day go buy faster and make me feel good. I used to take 10-20mg Percocet or hydros at work with a zan bar on top cuz I’m scribed benzos so my tolerance is high. My opiate tolerance is pretty high too. I did just take a break for about 3 and a half weeks but chewed up 30mg morphine and then popped 50mg Hydrocodone and smoked some weed then popped two bars just today and nodded pretty good for a few short hours. I got high but that was a lot of pills and I could definitely notice the tolerance still.

I’m wondering if I should take one before work so it lasts all day with a Xanax on top (I take 2-3mg of Xanax a day at work, I’m prescribed 6mg zan a day, does effect me like that; doesn’t make me sleepy) 

Hydrocodone and Percocet and Roxie 30s in high doses make me tired and Nod plus I always add one of my zans on top whenever I take opes, I know it’s not the safest but my tolerance is so high and it boosts the high. 

I’ve taken OxyContin a few times which is like Extended Release Roxie or Percocet with APAP and it made me super energetic. Would the Extended Release Morphine do the same? Plus it’s a low dose and I can take low dose of morph and I can take low doses of perks and hydros at work just fine (10-20mg) with a bar. It makes the day go by so fast :)

Plus since the good feeling was so strong on the previous day I figured it wouldn't be that big of a deal if it was a little less intense or I had gained a slight tolerance so I took another 90mg the next day and proceeded to feel absolutely nothing. In fact it may have even made me feel a little uncomfortable and I have no idea why. But there was no real high and there wasn't a single shred of euphoria. I was baffled.

Same pills from the same bottle, same amount of food in my stomach (approximately), it had been at least 24 hours since the last dose. I just don't understand what else it could be besides an apparent instant tolerance? Is codeine/opioid tolerance really that extreme?

I can do 10x the amount of coke and feel very little - then feel just crappy, out of it and heart pounding. 
All the good stuff is gone, used to feel very organized, energetic and happy. 
Is it not possible to get this high anymore now that I have these crappy generic hydrocodones in my system? 
Has anyone ever heard of this happening ? Does anyone have any ideas ? If I stop taking them for a few days before I go out , will that work ? 
Is there another type of drug I can start doing to get the same high ( with or w/o booze cause I really don’t even care about the drunk feeling anymore it’s not even worth the hangover at all - boring)

At 7pm I ordered subway, ate two footlongs and chugged a half gallon of water. Fell asleep right after and didn’t wake up till 8:30 this morning 

10/10, excellent weekend, just kept wishing I had some weed for those comedowns 

Question, anybody know when is too soon to drink more? If I wanted to drink another bottle or two tonight would I be alright? Or should I wait till later in the week? Any other tips?

I have this friend and he asked me for anti depressants and after some thinking I decided to give a few to him 
I knew he couldn't overdose on such a small amount, I knew it wasn't laced and it was absolutely legal 
I never took any money if that matters to anyone, even tho he offered to pay 

he offered it to another friend and we all took one and although it didn't affect me or him much our other friend was drowsy, he was late for class next morning
it's a common side effect, it isn't life threating at all and he was fine 

why did I do it? the guy that asked me has told me before he did the usual weed like the rest of us but also was afraid of someone selling him laced shit so came to me for an advice because he really wanted to try it and he knows I was on anti depressants before 
I know him well enough to know that he'll actually take some questionable shit (as he has) and will probably pay a lot for it so I wanted to save him the trouble as much as I could 

and that other friend that was curious about it said that he was so sleepy that he never wants to try it again and won't even think about weed or anything else 
I haven't given them or anyone anything else, I don't have anything else, I don't do drugs, hell I don't even remember when was the last time I smoked weed 

I believe drugs should be used recreationally and safely with people you trust and im glad that they asked me and not someone random, but I am wondering if what I did was wrong?

In Europe at least, hash is easy to come by and incredibly cheap. It usually costs the same or even less per gram whilst being many times stronger (Unless you bought literal dirt). 

Better deals and better quality can be found in an onion patch if you’d rather faff around with BTC (Highly reccomended).

**The kit:**

-	Hashish
-	Cooking oil (Olive preferably)
-	Standard metal beer bottle cap with plastic removed
-	Tweezers
-	Lighter
-	Food (Preferably bread and butter)

**The method:**

1.	Pour a small amount of oil into the bottle cap (~1/3 full)
2.	Take a tiny piece of hash (No bigger than a standard airsoft BB until you know the strength) and place it into the oil
3.	Hold the bottle cap with tweezers (Pinch by the rim so the tweezers are vertical)
4.	Place lighter on low underneath the bottle cap whilst gently swirling the oil until the hash is fully dissolved (~10-30 seconds, too long and it will stick to the bottom)
5.	Pour onto bread and coat with butter (Optional)
6.	Eat

I usually get the first sensations around the 20 minute mark then feel it nicely after an hour. Rarely, it can take 2.5 hours to peak so as with all edibles, re-dosing is very unwise. The effects usually last 4-5 hours.

I used to drink exclusively coffee as a supplement for studying long hours. My resoults were remarkable! 
  But then, ... Slowly I had switched from coffee only to energy drinks  only; my law school resoults had decreased.

I am not saying than my bavarage choice is the only factor at play here; but as I start to think about it; more and more I've come to bealive that the switch of caffeine intake form plays a determinantial role here. At least in my reflexions.

... But I had been ignorant of even the possibility of my bavarage of choice change  had any role what so ever in my end resoults (grades, speed of semester compliation, etc...) 

I have just learned to preffer the effects on my increased wakefullness caused by the energy drinks as compared to a more 'chilled-wakefullness' produced by coffee.

I was ignorant of the fact that the energy drink induced state, besides wakefullness, also produces a contra productive side effect, namely: compulsive behaviour... Which has a significatnt negative effect when your goal is to study long hours... It somehow changes your focus on the studies in to unproductive things... And it has a very strong pull - making it hard(er) for you to keep on doing what needs to be done. It somehow fills you with a desire to do anything other than 'work' you have assigned yourself to do.

Coffee, however, does not have such (hidden) negative effects. It' 'high' is much more chilled and relaxed. You can still feel 'sleepy' to a dagree while drinking coffee, but you can manage the sleepiness well enough to continue with your work; although perhaps with a bit of willfullness.

To sum it up. I have realised that it's not just about caffeine. It's, at the end of the day, about the end resoults and your success in reaching your goals. And coffee, I realised, is a better tool for such ends. Energy drinks can cause the opposite long-term effects; while coffee has it's reputation as a student drink for a reason. Prooven through times and generations of students.


I would like to hear your views on the matter. And perhaps some opposite argumenta.

What is weird about it to me is how it is in the background in everything I do. I’m always either high or coming down so my mental state is weird as hell.

Things make me mad enough to harm someone that normally wouldn’t even get a reaction from me. I’ve gotten into 5-6 fights in the past year alone. I’m known now as a hot head instead of laid back. 

I got 5 months clean and then relapsed so my family that knows about my use mostly gave up on me. I get weird looks when I’m high like they know but no one says anything anymore. I only get accused of being high when I’m sober so I guess that’s when I seem weird. My girlfriend says she loves me and she knows I will quit when I’m actually ready. Our relationship is pretty normal despite my addiction. 

Some days I feel like cocaine is a monster that bit me and won’t let go, so I’m constantly dragging  around the dead weight.

DMT cartridge which finally came last week and tried it for the very first time five days ago. While that trip was interesting and there were some pretty cool visuals involving these bright purple looking waves and lines rippling across my ceiling for a couple minutes before they went away, in hindsight, I didn't do enough to actually break through that first time and made sure to do more each time since. However, no matter what I've tried since then, no subsequent trip has come even CLOSE to that first one which as I said was pretty mild to begin with, let alone actually breaking through which probably would've been at least like five times as intense. This was the strongest, most potent cartridge this vendor had and I've smoked half of it away by now, yet I can never get anything more than a two- or three-minute body high each time. How is it even possible for a human being to have smoked close to 250 mg. of supposedly highly potent DMT oil over a little over 10 trips without breaking through even ONE time?

The vendor said you have to ""prime"" the cartridge before its first use by using a lighter or hair dryer to melt the crystals in the liquid in order to warm it up, which I did. He recommended taking a few big hits and holding each one in for about ten seconds, which I tried along with various other inhale/exhale combinations that ranged from only three or four hits per trip all the way up to eight or nine. I played with the voltage setting on my pen since it has a 510 battery and have done it at 3.3v, 3.8v, 4v, 4.2v, 4.8v and a couple other voltages as well. Almost all of these trips were when I had an empty stomach for maximum effects and I've smoked mornings, afternoons and nights to see if the time of day made a difference at all. Every trip was spaced out from the one before it anywhere from 30 minutes to almost two days to make sure my tolerance was at zero. This was all done between 30-45 seconds after the first inhale which is how you're supposed to do it from everything I've read as well as been told. My pen was charged enough for all but maybe one of these trips. I've tried literally EVERYTHING I can possibly think of.

I realize that cartridges aren't as strong as the actual powder but even so, there doesn't seem to be any good reason why I still haven't broken through after all of this experimenting and doing just about everything right that I'm aware of in order to make it happen because by now, that really should've happened at least once. At this point, the only logical explanation I can come up with is that this cartridge was MASSIVELY overpriced and wasn't nearly as strong as the vendor claimed it to be in the first place because it's certainly not my pen that's the issue here especially because this cartridge is compatible with it and as I said before, by all accounts, I've done everything the way that I'm supposed to in order to blast off but for some reason, it still hasn't happened yet.

I got kicked out of my home by my parents because I dropped out of school and was going to clubs and doing Ecstacy. I was living in a youth homeless shelter.

I had just recently discovered the wonderful world of drugs earlier that year. My first experience in that world was Ecstacy. Shortly after, I experienced weed. Now for those of you who've done Ecstacy, you can understand how wonderful it is. I was like is *this* what drugs are like!?!? So naturally, I wanted to try everything.

When I got to the homeless shelter, a girl took interest in me and became my girlfriend, let's call her C. C is 16 also. Little did I know, before I came along C was with this one dude we'll call B. B was a heroin addict. 

One morning, B asked me if I wanted to try some heroin. Ok, sure. Just give me a little bit tho I don't want to be too fucked up. We went to the bathroom and he prepped the needle. I saw that it was 25cc's of some dark brown muddy looking stuff. Into my arm it went. 

""How long does it take-"" I began to ask, and then I got hit by it. I immediately threw up. I couldn't even tell you how it made me feel, I don't really remember.  I had to go to work a couple hours later. I was nodding off on the train ride. I got to work and was almost nodding off on my feet. They sent me home early. 

After I got out of work, I met up with C downtown. We found a secluded place and smoked some weed. As we were walking away from that place, after smoking the weed, I started to feel strange. I told C I felt weird. Then I passed out. Fell backwards and smacked my head hard on the concrete, which woke me right back up. Fuck. That's never happened before.

We went to get some McDonald's. It's packed full of people. We're standing there waiting in line and I dust to get tunnel vision again and feel like I'm going to pass out. I tried to keep it together but ended up talking into someone beside me and then overcorrecting and falling into someone on the other side of me and trying to grab onto them to hold myself up before hitting the floor. Again, hitting the floor immediately bright me back to consciousness.
Super fucking embarrassing in a huge crowd of people, everyone starting at me. I sheepishly go find a table and wait for my C to get the food.

I later found it that I basically stole C from B. I also found out that B was 21 years old. He had lied about his age to stay in the youth homeless shelter. B was probably trying to kill me with an overdose or trying to at least get me hooked on heroin and ruin my life.

I'm 19, I've already been thrown out of my house not because of drugs but because I'm trans. i came back because my parents felt guilty, and since then everything was good, they stopped misgendering me, they started using my actual name. but at the time i wasn't living with them i started using and i got to know a new group of people. i fell in love with a guy i took dissociative drugs with, but after some trips i didn't even feel like myself anymore and it destroyed destroyed this relationship. 

my first time with dxm, i thought that i was dying, I was scared to move, i was scared to do anything and spent the whole time being comforted by him. I've never loved anyone in a way that i started loving him. great conversation every night by the phone. he used to care about what i think, used to care about me. i used to care about him. we also took lsd, mushrooms. it always was strange, magical, different way of feeling things sensually, the feeling of minds being connected in some way, all of this and soon I started being kind of out of touch with reality. and he started being like that as well. came to the realization that we have bad influence on each other. we wanted to meet and just be sober together but it didn't happened. before it could happen he stopped talking to me, said he's not ready for all of this. and tbh i wasn't ready for that as well. we would probably destroy ourselves with drugs, I haven't took anything else than psychodelics but he did actually. one of our last conversation was him telling me that he's on speed.

i loved him so much, but felt so so bad. i used to self harm some years ago and i relapsed. i had suicidal thoughts. psychodelics didn't make me spiritual but overly aware of how others precieve me and how much of animals people are. transphobia was 100% more painful, accidental misgender could trigger thoughs on stopping everything and just living somewhere not being seen at all. but the way that you can see the world, how you can experience music was worth it. at least that's what i thought. but still wanted to feel better and normal again. got antidepressants prescribed and probably because i didn't wait enough since tripping i experienced something close to serotonine syndrome and had to stop.

other friend asked me yesterday if i want to try 2-cb. i agreed, even though i wasn't feeling like I'm really sure about this. he said that it was the best trip that he had. for me it was the most visual one. but then i had to came back home. and i came back home. with pupils dilated. and before entering the house i saw a taxi car that i mistook for a police car and started panicking. my parents saw me like that. i cried, asked if that's it, end of me living with them. but they comforted me, they really cared about me. and I'm quiting.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,688161,public,confidence,self,i quit psychodelics,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hdrqmb/i_quit_psychodelics/,,no_ads,0.0,1592858898.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've missed this feeling so much. I'm not particularly bummed out about the fact that I've ""relapsed"" or whatever; I've been using other light drugs (stims, Kratom, weed, alcohol, and a single mdma roll) pretty moderately since I broke free of my nasty hydrocodone and tramadol addiction in 2017. What does bum me out, however, is how badly I want to feel like this all of the time. Being high on opiates just magically turns me into the happiest, most beautiful, loving, and most functional version of myself that I can only dream of becoming. Sober me could never be that person. I've tried.
I could go on and on about my negative life quality and low self worth. Idk. I just wanted to come here and get some positivity I guess. I'm enjoying my high rn, but I'm sad that it'll soon be over, and tomorrow I'll wake up as my unmotivated, grumpy, boring old self. I miss opiates every day, and I sometimes find myself looking into O-dsmt on the dnm and rc sites, but I never buy them because I don't want to be an addict again. 
Any advice on how to feel better day to day would be appreciated. I take Kratom, (real kratom that ships from borneo, no head shop shit) but the buzz I get doesn't quite compare to an opiate. I get great energy and pain relief, but it's missing the mood improvement, motivation and empathy I get out of pain meds. Basically, I miss the euphoria. Clean euphoria, unlike that of tweaky stimulants. Stims also fuck my moods during a comedown, so they're not my favorite, but I do take them occasionally for functionality. 
I wonder how antidepressants make you feel day to day? I was prescribed once when I was younger, took them for about six weeks and then stopped, basically because of money reasons. I don't really remember feeling any difference in myself after the initial 4 weeks on antidepressants. If anyone reading has experienced significant benefits from antidepressants, could you please compare them to a the qualities of an opiate high? Or any other suggestions, preferably ones that aren't ""just eat right exercise drink water and sleep, bro"" because yeah, I know. And I do. lol. I'd really like to talk to a speacialist soon and get my head right.

(cw for mentions of suicidal ideation.)

alright, so, let’s just cut to the chase, bc it’s kind of a long one: 

so i have adhd and type 2 bipolar (and some other stuff that isn’t really relevant), and have had both diagnoses for many years now. the onset of my bipolar was after i’d already been not only diagnosed w adhd, but also had already been taking adderall for just about two years. 

i also suffer from chronic nerve pain that heavily ties in with my emotional and mental state. so, depression sucks twice bc it manifests as pretty serious physical pain... which then makes me more depressed, bc i can’t do as much. i’ve also noticed over the years a pretty clear and obvious link between the certain pain flare-ups and having run out of adderall, as well as definite relief of some pain around the same time my first dose kicks in most days. i also take gabapentin and cymbalta to manage my pain, and the latter also helps w the bipolar. i’ve tested (mostly unintentionally around not getting filled on time) enough by now to know i definitely feel a lot worse without them. however, one of them makes me drowsy (not sure which), so without adderall to cancel that out, not only does my brain misfire all over the place, but i also frequently get exhausted doing literally nothing and fall asleep basically out of nowhere. so suffice to say that every condition that i have is in some way positively affected by adderall, and that without it, i simply do not function at all as i, or basically anyone else, would want. 

so that’s all great, right? well, it would be. however...

i cannot seem to get local pharmacies to take my request (even when signed by prescriber) to not substitute different generics at all seriously. this has been a major problem in the past, as i’ve once been given a goddawful version that i guess is packed w sugar for unethical parents to foist on their kids, and also struggled for a few months fairly recently when rite-aid abruptly swapped from aurobindo to montuklast, the latter of which did not work literally at all, and also gave me some severe gastric pain! yay. so i got my prescriber to request what i had been most recently taking, got told they had an exclusive contract now, and subsequently switched pharmacies... only to have them not fill it as requested either by the second month. but hey! it wasn’t as bad. so whatever right? 

yeah, maybe not. 

see, the thing is, for the last almost a year or even more, i’ve been in and out of some of the worst depressive episodes of my life. the last few months (incidentally, this timeline of decline overlaps p much exactly w the montuklast debacle!) have been particularly bad, and - with a notable exception i’ll get to shortly - just keep getting worse. all of this i’ve chalked up to societal unheavals, a major friend betrayal, and some digging back up of a serious personal trauma though, which would all be enough to trigger a bad state for anyone, especially someone with bipolar. 

and then four days ago, i misplaced my currently bottle of adderall, and, failing to locate it, opted to dig into my little apothecary box o’ forgotten &amp;amp; unused pills, and take some (corepharma) from back in march 2018 that showed up behind a bookshelf in a recent housecleaning effort. i figured it might not be as effective, given its age, but also that my refill date was only a few days off, and i would vastly prefer to have something to tide me over. 

what i did not expect was for it to work way, way better. 

like, two weeks ago i went full 2007 britney level of mental breakdown, and for, wow whaddya know, basically the last two years or so, i have been deeply unmotivated, unstable, and depressed. so much so that my identity had begun to crumble due to not being able to produce any art hardly at all for a period longer than i have ever experienced literally for my entire life. so much so that i’ve lost friends due to my inaction and just general not-fun-to-be-around-ness. not even major positive changes or events have budged me much, and i’ve found it extremely difficult to have any hope for the future whatsoever. oh yeah, and i’ve gained like, 40 pounds, which has super been great for my self esteem also!

so, with that backdrop, cut to three days ago, and i not only cleaned a bunch, and made dinner, just, like a normal goddamn person, but i also filled three pages in my sketchbook, and went to bed that morning (yeah, yeah, i know, whatever though, time’s fake and i’m a night person) feeling for the first time in fucking months like i didn’t want to sleep - and if i had to, like i was happy to know i would wake up again. 

the day after, i had a date at home w my partner, mailed a package that i shit you not i have had sitting in my house for at least six months, drew more, and swept the house, all of my own volition. and i felt fucking great! wow! finally, mania’s back babey!! 

cut to waking up the next day (yesterday), taking my adderall, immediately hopping up, having another pretty good day. i went on a walk w my partner, worked on a project together, and then, when he went to lay down “just for a little while”, i decided to surprise him by going out into the garden w a headlamp and gardening the shit outta that thing until he came back out to join me. 

i wound up gardening for about seven and a half hours straight, bc he, of course, fell asleep. i only stopped by my fingernails literally started shredding, and once i did, i finally realised how much searing, throbbing pain i was in, and also how hungry i was. but also? i felt genuinely proud, happy, and not even upset that he hadn’t gotten up when he’d said he would. suffice it to say these feelings are pretty unfamiliar to me at this point. 

so i went inside, took a bath, and finally passed tf out. 

it’s been more than 12 hours since, and despite the minor gardening injuries, i still feel great. even physically i’m in less pain than i have been in ages. 

so... what the fuck! i’ve done the research enough to know just how different various generics and formulations can be, and how much it can mess people up. i thought i knew the extent of that, bc of how much clearly worse the montuklast was for me. now though, i’m just mad. i don’t get how this can be legal, when it can have such an obvious and profound difference from one formulation to another. 

if they didn’t come in the same marked prescription bottles, i honestly don’t think i would even identify them as the same drug at all, even if they looked identical (they’re similar, but they do not). 

everything feels different. everything feels /better/. 

so just... what the fuck. and has anyone else had a similar experience? specifically someone with bipolar - as i have read similar anecdotes about depression from people w just, well, depression - but all experiences welcome. 

i’m getting my therapist on board to advocate for me, to help make sure i stop getting bad generics, bc i’m definitely convinced by now that they’re the problem, so i guess i’m probably good in the long run. just... fuck, right? i almost fucking killed myself! more than once! i ran multiple relationships into the ground and wasted more than a year of my damn life! and now i’m finding out it may well be bc some asshole somewhere made a new pharma contract deal to line some other assholes’ goddamn pockets, leading to my goddamn prescription being suddenly and silently filled w garbage? i feel so fucked over, it’s just, unreal. four days ago, i seriously thought suicide was becoming a when and not an if, because i no longer remembered what it felt like to be internally motivated or consistent in my own thoughts or actions. if i had never had to use an old bottle “to tide my self over”, or never had it, that “when” might have been soon. i’m just... blown away. even having sore muscles feels good again! 

anyway. it feels good, to vent, and in general. but gd, what a sick fucking joke.

big pharma can go to hell. these formulas &amp; their distribution shouldn’t be beholden to private shareholders and whoever can scam their way into a patent, and the products shouldn’t be walled off behind egregious costs. for all the hell this has caused me, at least i’ve had the coverage for any meds in the first place! burn it the hell down, tbh.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,688117,public,confidence,self,"a generic horror story: adderall, (bipolar) depression, and how my pharmacy may have nearly ruined my life",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hdocaa/a_generic_horror_story_adderall_bipolar/,,no_ads,0.0,1592843130.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has always been extremely available and cheap as well as highly socially acceptable. I started smoking very occasionally at 14, and for the first 5 years it stayed that way- 3-4 times a year, always a special occasion sort of thing. 


As a young adult (19) I started hanging out with a group of stoners and I began smoking daily, and continued that lifestyle for 8 years. I smoked all day, every day- smoking 1/8th to 1/4 a week.  At first I got the weed euphoria every time I smoked, but it didn't last. Near the end it barely affected me. I could smoke a ton and never get truly high. But I felt dependent on it. I got agitated and anxious if I didn't have it.


Then one day, I just didn't get the urge. It was so strange. I looked at my bong and just had zero desire. Then another day passed, and another. Then a month. I had quit cold turley without any intention of doing so. I went from feeling like I was addicted to no interest. It was the weirdest thing. Nothing really changed in my life. I wasn't looking to quit and when I did, my lifestyle didn't really change. I didn't lose weight, find more motivation in life, life didn't seem more 'real', nothing really changed except for spending money on weed and procuring was no longer a frequent occasion.


After awhile I started smoking again occasionally. (Getting my tolerance back was rough, so much paranoia.) Nowadays I smoke 2-4x a week and a small puff or two on my bubbler gets me pretty stoned. When I find myself in a smoke circle I am the first to tap out.


Here's the downside- the 'magic' of weed is just gone. I almost never feel euphoric while stoned, or have those mind-blowing epiphanies. No munchies where food becomes the most amazing thing ever. No enhancement during sex. It mellows me a little, and that is it. It's kind of a bummer. I see people high as balls giggling and munching and I am so envious.

Well it's sweltering hot out today so I quickly turn on the AC to get cool before I smoke and sure enough as soon as I turn around the foil goes flying drops the ball and I can't find It.

I search for 30 minutes looking for it but I give up because my brother is home and he can't know I still use so I quickly load up the rest and smoke that shit. I figured since I acquired the money by means of fuckery (wasn't my money it was my grandmas she sent me to the store and forgot to ask for change I know it's a dick move but it's part of addiction for some people) anyways I figured losing the other half was just karma for using money that isn't mine and left it be but I wanted to get a little higher some bud some coke anything. I find out my brother went down the street to record music so I go down there he's just chilling I meet with old Friends I haven't seen in years all that good stuff anyways I see my brother and our friend sneak off to the garage so I follow to see if they are smoking some weed or something I go in there they are all talking chilling then our friend pulls out a white bowl and another guy comes in the room and pulls out the same type of bowl mind you I'm in the west coast so everyone smokes Meth out here.

 So I'm not surprised really they start smoking but I'm a little shocked because our friend hands my brother the pipe and he starts rolling the bowl I was shocked because be told me he quit 6 months ago so I just went with it not going to act weird and be that guy in the group I've only smoked Meth one time about two months ago I enjoyed it but it's not my drug of choice I've grown to like downers and try to stick to just weed when I can. Next thing I know the older guy who showed up and hands me the pipe so I casually try to smoke it but they immediately catch on and see I have no idea what I'm doing plus I have glasses so my depth perception isn't great they laugh and help me light it right and tell me how to roll it properly because my dumbass kept rolling to fast and almost spilling the shit everywhere lol just my luck I tried to act casual and now all eyes are on me and of course after that they give me this long talk about how I need to make sure I don't say anything and keep my cool when I walk out the garage I'm 22 and the other two guys are twice my age and my brother is 8 years older so they just see me as a kid still so I just humble down and listen to them take there advice even though I've smoked Meth before (never to that extent though took a few hits this time last time I only took two and it was supposedly pure Meth.

I don't Know what pure Meth feels like but I imagine this is it very clean high not alot of jaw clenching and such just more euphoria and energy) but anyways I play it cool and smoke cigarettes with everyone and try to wait my turn to talk and not talk over anyone but the burst of energy made it hard to keep my thoughts to myself lol so today has been weird to say the least I lost half of my dope it's somewhere in my room I hope junkie Jesus comes Tomorrow and helps me find it but I took a loss losing my shit but I smoked ice with my brother for the first time which was interesting cause it's his DOC kinda felt both of them cause I was at the tail end of my dope high which was cool too now I don't have to worry about withdrawal at least not until the Meth wears off anyways sorry for the long post happy highs everyone!",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,688113,public,confidence,self,Bitter sweet weird and day,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hdnulx/bitter_sweet_weird_and_day/,,no_ads,0.0,1592840700.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I regret the experiences so much. Like god damn, I didn’t even nut. It was so uncomfortable holy shit. I think I just felt alone and he wanted to hangout when I was on acid, and he took advantage of me. I guess just nobody has ever made me feel so taken advantage of. I was on a few drugs both times, and he knew, and I guess just worked his gay magic. Fuckin just scared me I guess because of the type of person he is. He said I love you to me the second time he blew me. Like what the fuck. I’m on acid dude are you kidding me what’s going on. It’s sad that he used to be a cool friend, but now he’s a fuckin creep.

Over the past two years I've got more into bodybuilding and within the last six months I decided to jump on the juice. I'm on my first cycle consisting of testosterone propinate and trenbolone acetate. If you haven't heard before steroids massively increase your sex drive especially trenbolone. Trenbolone is the one steroid to bring out your inner sexual filth and combined with meth it turns you into a sexual deviant of alien proportions.   

I'm one week into my cycle and my sex drive has shot up massively and my desire for deviancy knows no bounds. I decided to slam a small shot of meth and go cruising on grindr. I want to try something I've never done before fuck a transman. After a couple of hours I find a hunky transman who is surprisingly pnp friendly. I say I've got some crystal and I want to fuck in a public restroom they're down but they want to fuck raw. I normally use condoms but the crystal flowing through my veins combined with the viagra pumping through half erect meth penis is telling me yes. 

They want to be fucked in the ass and I agree but only if we use crisco as lube to really up the filth factor. They happily agree. So we meet in the public park and chat for a little bit I bring out a small baggy of crystal and I shot him up with a 1 point shot. His eyes roll back in his head and he demands that I fuck him immediately. I happily oblige we go into the bathroom I pull down my pants and start lathering my penis in crisco. He pulls down his pants and starts lathering his anus in crisco at first I'm slightly frightened because there are open sores in his anus which is probably herpes. I'm hesitant and first but do a small bump of crystal and say fuck it and I go balls deep. 

We have sex for a good hour I switch repeatedly between both his anus and vagina trapped in a stream of constant sexual ecstasy. I finish but I have the nagging desire for something more. I ask him if he'll shit on me. He seemed very thrilled at the thought and I shot him up with another shot of crystal to get his bowels really brewing. I lay on the floor and wait to be covered in his filth. He unleashes the flood gates and shits all over my stomach. I get off the ground covered in filth and fuck him in his vagina until he has a massive orgasm my ejaculate inside him my mission has been accomplished.

We both get our clothes fully back on myself still covered in shit we walk out the door of the park restroom I can see a couple people staring at us. The thought of being viewed at as human garbage by all of these park goes even turns me on more. I get a massive erection and ejaculate into my pants on my walk back to my apartment. I hop in the shower and rinse the filth off myself and eat a xanax and fall fast asleep relishing in the filth I experienced hours ago. ",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,698874,public,confidence,self,Meth fueled steroid sex adventures,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/i2s7je/meth_fueled_steroid_sex_adventures/,no_ads,0.0,1596465694.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m asking because I got some presses off a sketchy plug, apparently he only fucks with pharma because literally every time I hit him up for bars he has them. The other day he said he couldn’t get any pharma so I asked if he could find presses and he didn’t respond for a while then said I can get pharma bars at 5pm. 

7pm rolls around and I get them. Long story short I’ve been taking the bars since yesterday, I took half a white bar which is from the sketchy plug but I also took 1.5 blue bar presses off a different plug throughout the day. I ended up nodding and swerving a bit while driving home and had to pull over in someone’s front yard to puke, a car passed me from behind me and saw and I also passed a jogger who probably saw.  I go home, argue with my parents that “I’m sick and we don’t have the soup I want”. I passed out at like 7pm and woke up at 4am feeling amazing. 


Today I crushed half a white press and I’ve been finger dipping it like molly but the high only lasts like an hour if that till I feel nearly at baseline. If I take multiple finger dips in a row it hits me hard for like 20 mins to the point I started nodding out and saw myself going through a tunnel backwards. It felt warm and content then I snapped out of it. When I get really high like that it gives me a little nausea too but it only lasts like 20 mins then I’m left with a normal benzo high like 30-40mg diazepam if even. It’s so weird because the bars taste like pure alprazolam like if most people tried to chew half a bar dry they’d puke almost instantly. 

I’ve been taken bars off and on since 2015 so I know Xanax and I should not have puked off 2 bars through the day let alone be nodding out from  finger dosing half a stick today. At most I took 3/4th of a bar but forsure no more then that.

As a way to keep myself from slipping completely into the abyss and doing any more damage to myself, I’ve started smoking weed a lot more. It’s become a daily ritual and integral part of my mental health.

I usually buy from my brother’s friend back home, but now that I’m smoking so much I can’t justify the risk of transporting that much bud in my car across the state,  so I ended up talking to this friendly guy in a unit above me and he helped hook me up with a friend of his who he buys from.

Well we were smoking together last night he brought me down a little ball of opium that he had harvested and whatever, and told me I could try it and just to mix a little bit in with my weed. Well, this morning I did just try at. Sandwiched a small piece between some grass in my pipe and smoked it, and hooooooly shit was that shit good. Like I am blown tf away.

I wouldn’t say i’m a super regular user, some of the people that i’ve dropped with do it far more frequently than me. I would say about every 3-4 months. Anyway, every time i’ve rolled I immediately have insane visuals that start with a sort of holographic/neon light show. Some examples: 

-	People wearing huge glasses that aren’t real
-	Glitter tears 
-	Insects and animals that are all glittery and neon 
-	Halos and crowns 
-	Animated faces/ filter effect looking things 

After a redose, these mellow visuals turn into full on visions that I honestly can never tell if they are me dreaming or not. They are so real that people often have to shake me to ask what the heck i’m talking about or looking at. My eyes will open or closed it doesn’t matter it’s like i’m in a VR world. I’ve seen things like this: 

-	Flash mobs 
-	Famous athletes/celebrities 
-	Been a character in my favorite TV show
-	Thinking I was in a totally different place with totally different people 

Anyway, everyone is always so concerned for me because they have never experienced anything even remotely close to this. Even people who have done hallucinogens say they don’t have super realistic and beautiful hallucinations like the ones I have described. That’s also why it’s so fascinating... because it’s never uncomfortable. I always know I’m rolling and can appreciate the things i’m experiencing as if it was VR.

""My generation"" is doing the crime.

I got a deal with a plug gone wrong (I am 26 almost 27, kid is 21) Been dealing exchanges for a month, he failed a lot but I let it through. Now this time I've been waiting more than a week for something. I snapped and threatened him with snitching on bank authorities (illicit money, illegal where I live) and snitching to police BECAUSE a reliable source told me he scams like that (ask for money in advance, then disappears). This shit is not dark web, this is face to face. This is instant, it shouldn't take more than two days,

Anyways, I tried cooling off the situation, but I'm extremely pissed off. I told him I was joking around, that I'm a known bouffoon/trickster, that I was trying to teach him a lesson on not doing impossible deals and accepting money beforehand, because someone more agressive than me can react worse. He then calmed down. But I still threatened him. Before all of that he threatened me with a gun for asking for a full refund.

I can do two things. I got nothing to lose, got fired.

1. I got fucked, admit I got fucked, accept that. Make it clear to this person we're cool and that I' was goofing around and that everything I threatened to do is realistically impossible.

2. Proceed with bank authorities and police. Admit I was making a deal with a plug, that he stole my money, I asked for my money back, then he ""pullled"" a gun on money. Got his name, bank account, contacts, location, full legal name. I could fuck this up out of proportions if I wanted to.

This is all likely going to sound immature and dramatic, but i dont really have anyone to vent to so i guess here is the right place. I have recently graduated from high school even though I thought I never would (thanks to corona for causing online classes, I basically got free A's although I also never got a prom or graduation ceremony) and I have no idea where to go from here, nor do I see a reason to go on at all. I always said I would never try any substances because everyone in my family (everyone on both my moms and dads side, and it goes back for generations) has addictive personalities and has struggled at some point in their life with dependencies, usually on alcohol, pain pills and/or nicotine products. My mom and dad had it the worst though and went from average high school students to homeless heroin addicts in a pretty short span of time. I was born at one of the lowest points in their lives and two 18 year old heroin addicts aren't exactly fit to raise a child, so my grandparents were eventually granted guardianship. I did end up spending a little time with my parents as a child, as they were allowed to move in with me once they got over their phase of showing up just to scream and shout a few death threats at my grandma which I assume was for not receiving a handout to go buy some more dope (I'm not usually one to self diagnose but im fairly certain I have PTSD from these experiences, as anytime I hear someone yell or even slightly raise their voice, i can hear my dads voice in my head yelling at my grandma, I still remember every word he said and it makes me feel like a helpless child in that moment, so I usually either dissociate or breakdown crying because it feels so real). Once they moved in with me everything went pretty well aside from having to witness and learn how to handle my mother's seizures as a 5 year old, but they soon split up and moved out and I never even got a explanation. I also never got an explanation as to why they weren't the ones who raised me, nor did they tell me about their substance issues, but i finally ended up getting a brief explanation from one of their friends years later. I never really put much thought into it but it was recently brought to my attention that this kind of childhood along with being bullied for years is likely why I've despised myself for most of my life. After this I ended up living a fairly normal life (besides being dirt broke) up until i was 16, which is when I decided to try alcohol while camping and start my journey with drugs. Once that first sip of alcohol touched my lips, I was in love. The burning warm sensation throughout my body made me feel like I was at peace with myself for the first time. I immediately began drinking daily with friends from morning to night. By the end of my first week of drinking we had already cleared out my friends parents entire stash of booze, and I could not handle finally coming back to reality so I did not eat, drink or sleep for days on end. After a couple days of this, I convinced my friends to come with me around the campground at night to steal booze from people's coolers. This became a regular thing, to the point where we would even do it in broad daylight. One day when we couldn't find any booze, my friend convinced me to try his weed instead and i hated it. After a few weeks of this it was finally time go go home and say goodbye to these friends i had made at the campground, although I've yet to say goodbye to those habits we formed. Once I was back home I immediately started stealing booze from my family any chance I could get, until I discovered weed in the form of a vape. I began hanging out with new friends who would hit carts and smoke weed after school, but i decided to stick to the cart to avoid smell. I did my own research on these black market carts and even though i concluded they were likely deadly and a waste of money, i began buying my own not even a week after trying my first one. Since I loved the carts so much I figured I should get into weed instead to be healthier, but just ended up smoking both daily (weed before and after school, and carts during school) and eventually became heavily dependent on the carts. Im not sure if they were laced (its fairly likely though as people in my area tried lacing them with all sorts of substances like fent or benzos) or if i just had a very bad dependency on the thc but after a few hours of not hitting one I would get unbearable withdrawals like extreme stomach pain (almost a burning sensation), twitching eyes, shaking, and sweating. The stomach pain was so bad i lost 60 pounds in a short period of time from not eating. If I went too many hours without hitting one i would end up pacing around the room and felt like I was going insane, so I would rummage around to find old empties and try hitting them again for the millionth time as if something magically filled them back up in the 10 minutes they sat on the floor. By the time I was 17 I was so overdue for a T break that weed was doing absolutely nothing for me, so that's when I began my cycle of ""quitting"" and coming right back, and I also began trying new substances whenever I went without weed. I ended up not trying anything crazy, just things like acid, shrooms, oxys and addys, however i took them in dangerous combinations and situations like alcohol and percs alone outside in the middle of the night. This was all before corona however, and once quarantine started it complicated things a bit so I ended up quitting carts/weed for a while but kept juuling. This only lasted a month or two though and I soon went back to daily smoking, but i at least rarely hit carts anymore. I used to be suicidal whenever I was sober because I hated myself and even though i dont struggle with the self hatred as much anymore, im still extremely suicidal while sober and i can't handle it anymore. Now that I've graduated im realizing that I've been in such a cloudy headspace for years that I never actually put any thought into adulthood, I thought I'd be dead by now. I have no sort of plan or ideas for post high school education, nor do i see the point in going on to struggle just to live a mediocre life and die like everyone else. I feel guilty not only for being distant to the few people I was still close to in the past couple years but also for being a horrible influence on them, as many of my close friends ended up doing everything I did and adopting my mindset. Most of them I don't feel bad for anymore as I've finally realized they were never real friends, they only came around for drugs, but my actual best friend I still feel guilty about. He was always a good kid and I got him to start smoking with me, and he soon became just as bad of a fiend as me. He is now basically the only friend I have left and he is moving away, and even though he recently quit smoking, I still regret causing almost all of our memories to look back on to just be of smoking, but now its too late to change that. My girlfriend has been the only other person to stick with me through all this and make me a better person (I can honestly say she is the only reason I didn't end up committing suicide when I came close to it in the past) and she is also moving away for college now. I feel bad for putting her through such hard times so I used to want to distance myself for her own good, however now that she's moving im realizing I genuinely want to be with her forever, and I don't know how ill manage with her being in another state. At this point I have been spending my time either smoking to pass the time or  entertaining suicidal fantasies while sober, to the point where ill dissociate for hours planning it out until I realize my dumbass has been sitting somewhere like the fucking bathroom or a park bench for hours. I keep almost all of this to myself and nobody knows the full extent of any of it (especially my family) so its making me feel like I'm going insane handling this on my own. I'm sorry that was so long and all over the place but im just putting together the pieces of my past for the first time instead of ignoring it and although I could vent this to my girlfriend, I figure people in this sub would likely understand my struggle more.

Throwaway account, obviously.

My sister and I share a house together. On three separate occasions she has come home with blue powder in her nose. 

About five or six months ago she came home from work and I noticed she had blue in her nose. I laughed and told her she had something on her face, thinking it was candy or ink or something. She went to the bathroom to wash it off and I thought nothing of it.

A month or so ago she came home and I noticed it again. I waked by her in the kitchen and just noticed it out of the corner of my eye. I turned around and told her to “come here.” Granted, I did say it very pushy. She immediately backed up and was said no, and looked at me like I was crazy. I told her I wanted to look at her face and she got all snappy and said no again, and then went to the bathroom and closed herself in. When she came out the blue was gone. I tried to argue with her about it but she just told me I was crazy and refused to accept that I’d seen what I saw.  

Tonight she came home from work. I came out of my bedroom to say hey sit around while she ate a late dinner. It wasn’t until I walked around the island to sit next to her that I noticed she had freaking blue in her nose again. My demeanor immediately changed, but I didn’t know what to say. She picked up on my tenseness pretty quickly and asked why I was mad all of a sudden and I told her to go look in the mirror.

She went to the bathroom (around a corner and down the hall so she was out of my eyesight) and was silent for nearing two minutes. She came back out then and said “what is something on my shirt?” I told her I refused to have a conversation if she was going to lie right to my face, then I went to my room.

I know nothing about drugs, and I hate to think she would go there, but I don’t know what else it could be if she would so blatantly lie to me about it.

Does anyone know what could dye the inside of your nose blue? I could really use some help here.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,698816,public,confidence,self,Blue powder in nose,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/i2omaf/blue_powder_in_nose/,no_ads,0.0,1596449159.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another use for speech scramblers could be to impose thought control on a mass scale. consider the Human body and nervous system as unscrambling devices. A common virus like the cold sore could sensitize the subject to unscramble messages. Drugs like LSD and Dim-N could also act as unscrambling devices. Moreover, the mass media could sensitize millions of people to receive scrambled versions of the same set of data. Remember that when the human nervous system unscrambles a scrambled message this will seem to the subject like his very own ideas which just occurred to him, which indeed it did.""

Instead of constant stress of bills or this and that all you have to worry about is eating every day and whatever random obstacle has presented itself. I liked to keep to a nicer part of town with no other homeless people where the mall and all the businesses were but I also had a “wherever the wind blows me attitude.”

So at this time I was I believe 20 and I was on suboxone. I was prescribed 3 of the 8 mg strips a day and I was lucky enough to have Medicaid and a sub doctor who accepted Medicaid. My doctors visit and prescription was covered 100%. I was staying at a homeless shelter and I had met a dude there that was passing through hitch hiking and was maybe early 30s. He was one of the only people in the shelter not completely shot out. Seemed completely normal. Just didn’t like living a normal life and liked hitch hiking and traveling which is something I had been wanting to do. He and I took the bus out to the beach and hung out for the day and made a plan to hitchhike to Tampa together. That was about 7 hours from where we were in the panhandle which was a real trip. Nevertheless dude knew the ropes and swore we’d be fine. The next day we head out about 3 pm. We make it back out to the beach to start walking and holding our thumb out. Before we started walking dude busts out a bag of meth that I had no idea he had. I didn’t think the guy did drugs. Long story short after a few hours of hitchhiking he was being super fucking controlling and started acting completely different after doing the ice so I was like fuck this. Dude flagged a car down and they were offering to drive us 3 hours and I told the dude fuck you bye. He begged for a couple minutes while I walked the other way and then was gone. So as I’m walking back this hood ass dude pulls up and was like “Yo white boy it’s hot as fuck out here. You wanna ride?” So I throw my bag in his car and he asks where I’m going and I tell him just back to town. I tell him I really appreciate it and I have no money to offer but I said idk if you know anyone but here’s a suboxone strip you can sell to someone for like 20$. Turns out this dude sold subs when he could get them. He ended up buying 10 of them from me for 15$ a piece so I had him drop me off at the greyhound station. 

I was still in the mood to explore but I didn’t want to walk with my thumb up or anything like that. I decided I was gonna take greyhounds from city to city exploring and I would sell subs at the stations to get from place to place. With the money I had I bought a ticket to Mobile, Al and had enough when I got there to buy a ticket to New Orleans next. So I get to Mobile and start exploring downtown and I had bought a ticket to New Orleans for the next night. I was gonna explore mobile. Sleep in the station and then explore again the next day and then leave. So I do that and the next day as I’m almost time to leave I meet this lady(straight milf) going to rehab. She was shy about it so I was all like don’t feel bad I’m on subs. Her eyes lit up and asked if I had any. I didn’t wanna fuck up her rehab trip but she said they were gonna make her cold turkey off roxys and begged to buy one for 50$. I immediately was like fuck yes. So she goes to get on her bus as they’re calling for it and she runs back to me and grabs my hand and pulls me in the bathroom and hands me another $50 and says one more please so of course I sell it to her.

Now I’ve got a little money under my belt so I can eat and buy my next ticket in New Orleans to Houston and I’m feeling happy about things. I take off on the bus and get to New Orleans and same thing. I explore for a day. Sleep in the station and then explore some the next day. I happen to meet a dude that’s got a bunch of crack. I had never smoked it but I gave him 20$ to be able to smoke with him and it was a fun time. Lol. The next day I take off to Houston. I get there at night time and underestimated this city. 

Houston’s greyhound is in the middle of downtown and there’s homeless people EVERYWHERE. At night the massive parking lots are completely filled with homeless people sleeping using the concrete blocks that stop your tires in a parking spot as pillows. After having to eat expensive greyhound food and spending money stupidly I was down to not much and stuck in Houston. I couldn’t find anyone to buy any subs and I literally had no family to help me out or anything. Things were going downhill. So what I did was bought a bus ticket and took a bus way outside of downtown where I could fly a sign and hopefully get out of this city. Lol. Finally after several hours of flying a sign saying “Will work for a bus ticket home” someone picked me up and took me to their shop where they worked and bought me a ticket all the way back to my city. 


This was longer than I intended but it’s one of my many adventures. I wasn’t super descriptive with things so it wouldn’t be even longer but there was a lot more that happened than I included.

 I'm Matt. I'm a lurker, an addict and a big podcast fan. I dont post much but I read posts all the time and having been through so much bullshit myself I cant help but have love for all my brothers and sisters living the struggle of chasing that next high and all the shit we go through to get it, and it makes me want to start a podcast for our community to swap stories and knowledge and from our community, to give the squares a peek at what its like and humanize us. 
 That isnt to say i want it to be all doom and gloom. Because as we know, it isnt. I know alot of us have alot of horror stories, but we also have wild ass scummy adventures that we are able to laugh about sometimes.
 So first off, im curious if any of y'all would be interested in listening to 30 minute podcast like this if it existed?
 Second if anyone would be interested in sharing their own story for me to share on the podcast ( author credited however you like)? Funny, crazy, scary, sad, weird, beautiful, whatever, just your favorite war story that is too much for the NA room. Tell me about copping dope, scamming and scheming to get money, close calls, getting caught up by your family or the law. Lets hear about the weight you were moving and how you fucked up, how you went from chipping to rehab, the chick you met in detox, the methadone clinic blues. Lets hear about your recovery and what you got back or the 20 times you have tried and failed. Share about the time you got spun and broke your dick, or about the hellish withdrawal you survived on a jail floor in a desert town. 
 If you want share a short version of it here or send it to me privately. 
 Starting this podcast is my goal for this year and im gonna make it happen. I would love to have the support and input of this community and I will do right by all y'all.
Thank you.

I’ve been trying to simplify my life in the past few weeks by cutting out one of my summer school courses, going out to party less, and telling my roommates to keep it down and not have rangers in their room every night. Any way I’ve been doing better than I was last month, but I still feel so out of place in my life right now. I’ve been smoking everyday, whether it’s once at night or all day, and I was getting drunk at least 4 times a week, and I can’t tell at this point if I need to get out and restart life with a new crowd and place and/or if I need to cut out liq and weed to see the truth. 

I feel like I need both, and I’m thinking of taking a 1.3g shroom edible alone tonight to think about all this, but I’m not even sure if that would help. 

I also kinda feel like going cold turkey with everything, except everyone around me smokes, drinks, and does all Kinds of pills, and psychedelics regularly (it’s even become an event for them). 

On top of all this I fractured my wrist a month ago which has been kinda stressing me out too because I can’t do as many things that put my mind at ease before.

I still have an extra semester of high school left, so I can’t just pick up and leave (plus Covid is a bit limiting).

&amp;#x200B;

When I turned 18, I visited Amsterdam with my high school mates, tried shrooms too ofc. It was a magical experience laying in the park watching the summer clouds morph into such shapes I didn't know could exist. It was truly a life changing experience.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I returned from the vacation, told one of my other friends about it who I occasionally smoked up with. Told him I saw shroom grow kits in headshops and he was immediately like: Dude, let's grow mushrooms! I scoffed at him as I wasn't in dire need of money, I was about to become a college student living in mamahotel, and I didn't want trouble. Besides, going to AMS from eastern Europe foor grow kits is economically unviable. He kept insisting, he did his research on how to do it, found places to buy spores and the idea started to creep up on me. He said he'd handle the growing op at his place and I'd be selling, as he had no contacts (I always bought the weed). And well, shrooms don't have such an ominous smell as ganja, so it should be much safer right? Then it dawned on me that he lives with his mom and grandma. I asked, and he said they'll be ok with it, so I said: OK man, lets do this. 50-50 share.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now onwards to planning our little op. The place to order the spores was an austrian shop that sold these ""for research purposes only"". Haha yeah right XD The details to growing is fuzzy for me, as I wasn't the one handling it but the method we initially tried was something like this: Sterilize a jar and seal it airtight with some stuff in it that mycelium can grow on. Then put the spores in a syringe and inject it into the jar, then seal it. After the mycelium has grown, put some vermiculite into bags, some of the grown mycelia and perlite on top to seal moisture then seal the bag and put it in a dark place. (As I said details are fuzzy, so I might be super wrong on stuff). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So off we went to buy supplies. First we made smoked some, cos what better way to start buying growing supplies than getting stoned right? XD So first we went into the pharmacy to buy needles. Now, the neighborhood had kind of a heroin problem, so 2 visibly stoned kids coming in to buy needles was more than suspicious to them, and the pharmacist asked what they were for. I didn't expect the question, my friend froze, and super baked me simply blurted out the truth, that we want to inject spores into a sealed container. I added a lie about some biology experiment. He seems to sorta believed us, and we walked away with 10 needles. Yay! Now we neededother stuff. My partner found a farm shop on the other end of town, so we went there, walked in clueless, and asked for Vermiculite and perlite. Shop assistant asked, how many bags. 1 each my dude. He pointed us towards a stack of bigass 100L bags, and said there's the vermiculite. No, they did not sell in smaller quantities. Luckily the perlite bag was reasonably sized for our little op. So now he had a bigass bag in his 10 squaremeter apartment room, but we figured we'll use it up in time. Wrong.  


&amp;#x200B;

We were unsuccessful at growing any, the mycelium refused to grow, and we had a mold problem. So my friend said we should try a new method, cos he read it, that in Australia Psylocibe grows naturally on horseshit, so we should get some horse poo instead of the vermiculite. I objected heavily, I told him the apartment is going to smell putrid and I don't want to sell shrooms grown on shit. He kept insisting that horseshit doesn't have a smell, we went back and forth, and eventually I gave in. Ok, let's dump the vermiculite and some poo from a stable. He found a dude on the internet, we turned up, said we want to buy a bag of horseshit. Apparently there was some misunderstanding, and the guy thought we'll take all the crap, so he doesn't have to dispose of it himself. He insisted on us getting a truck and take it all away for free, which ofc was not an option for us. Finally we convinced him to let us buy just one big bag, and off we went with it. I already told him it smells in the car, but he was adamant on using it to grow. We took it up the apartment, got super stoned, watched a movie. Then I asked him: Now what? He said we'll dump it in the bathtub pour water on it, and put some immersion heaters in.

&amp;#x200B;

YOU WHAT??? WE'RE DOING WHAT? WHY EXACTLY ARE WE GOING TO COOK POO?

&amp;#x200B;

He told me we need to sterilize the shit to get rid of mold. That seemed incredibly bullshit to me, but I'm gullible as fuck when high, so I went with it. Biggest. Mistake. Ever. We turned the heaters on, smoked some more and waited. We went back in the bathroom after like 30 minutes, and oh boy the smell. The most rancid smell I ever had the misfortune to. It was like standing above an open cesspit amplified 100x. I immediately turned away and threw up as soon as he opened the door. His cat came, and started to eat it, but I guess the smell hit it too, and it ran away.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Dude, we're NOT growing on this shit, this is fucking disgusting.

\- Agreed man, I'm sorry, this was a really dumb idea.

\- Ok, how are we going to dispose of this? Put it into the toilet and flush it?

\- No that'll clog the toilet in no time, we need to scoop it into plastic bags and throw it into the waste chute.

\- Ok. YOU'RE DOING THE SCOOPING, THIS WAS YOUR FUCKING IDEA!

\- I am going anywhere near that bathtub, you're doing it (while laughing, we were baked AF)

\- (his grandma appears behind my back) I'll do the scooping.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt SO bad for this poor lady, putting the horsecrap with her bare hands into the bags, while we took them to the waste chute laughing our asses off on the situation. The stairwell reeked for days, I can't imagine what his neighbours thought. When we finished, we sat down.

&amp;#x200B;

\- What now dude? Growing is your op.

\- Guess we can order grow kits from the same place.

\- Dude.  They sell ready to go boxes too, and WE JUST COOKED SOME SHIT INSTEAD?

\- It would've been cheaper man!

This is a throwaway account. If you are thinking about it... don’t.  This was my first ever high, I took 2 big table spoons and didn’t feel much at first so I went to bed.  I woke up like 6 hours later and suddenly that’s when it started to kick in, I began to sweat tremendously, my vision was beginning to fade out and my heart rate was slowing down. 
In this state I was trying to make my way to the kitchen to get myself a glass of water and luckily my mum was there just seconds away from passing out I remember my heart stopped beating.  The memory of my heart not beating still frightens me really,  being stuck in a limbo between life and death.  I was lucky my mum caught me and helped me through that experience but never again. 

For the high itself it wasn’t too bad, I did have light hallucinations, colour was bright but the downside is outweighs the good.  Throughout the duration of the high I kept thinking I was dead for three days.  Also, for a month after this I kept hearing my heart make this click/pop sound.  I was concerned but luckily for me this issue resolved after a month.

I’ll take any advice and I’ll even back out if it is deemed unsafe by anyone with a medical background.

I’ll be taking shrooms! It’ll be a small dose though.

Anyways, I was always told (we aren't a gang, we don't gangbang, we just sell shit, that's it). Gangs aren't really a thing where I live. So we made a deal and it has been more than a week and the guy just gave me excuse and excuses, I told him I wanted my money back. He threatened me, then I threatened him because I won't let a pencil-neck 21 year old kid threaten me.

Then comes his friend (another kid same age), which I've never seen. Writes me up threatening me, first thing he does is send me a picture of a gun. Turns out these guys do gangbang and gang affiliation do exist, it doesn't matter if my neighborhood is ""working middle class"". Then I wrote both guys I don't want anything anymore, to keep the money, to not harm me or approach me at all (they know my face and where I live).

The first guy from the deal is still keeps writing me, told me to calm down that he understands, that he was sorry for the gun thing and that no one will harm me. I've told him ""dude if you're going to give me my thing just give it to me, otherwise keep your money, block me and forget about me and stop writing me"". I could take this to authorities but I got reminded about the guy that threatened me with a gun about ""no snitching"". And I recently got laid off so I'm better off not fucking around. It has been a whole week.

I got more plugs that I've known for years, my age or older. Low profile, problems are resolved so there's never conflict or violence.

I originally, planned on taking about 15g of truffles but now I'm thinking it's best to take a lower dose to reduce tolerance for my acid trip. I'll also be with 2 friends in Amsterdam who have little to no experience with psychadelics so it's probably a good idea for at least one of us to tripsit anyway.

If I take 5g of truffles what kind of effects can I expect for someone who's never tried psilocybin? And is 5g even too much if I want a good trip from 200ug only 4 days later?

I actually never heard of this until I purchased some from a friend thinking it was ecstacy. I always test my stuff so when I tested it. The mox turned orange-ish = amphetamine. So I told my my friend and she reported back to who ever she got it from. So apparently that is what that guy has been selling to people. 

Obviously I decided to try it. After a little reading about it. I was like. ""Oh aderall"" cool maybe I can focus on my art better. Took it and not much happened for a while. I have a high tolerance for stuff so I took another.   Then it kicked in the horny stuff people talk about. So day one I made the mistake probably most will and have done. Masturbated with no lotion or lube I just got stuck feeling good. So I had the sore limp dick but it still felt good. I learned the power grip and it helped me orgasm. And I could just keep on cuming over and over. But I had to stop it.was hurting.

Second time. I smartened up and used lubrication. Went great. After a few times I learned if I refrain on cumming. I can stroke it for longer hours. Then when it was morning i can do the multi cum till I cant before I have to shower and head to work. 

Great experiences so far can redose half way through. And it just gets me to the level wher almost all porn looks great!. It opened a few doors and I realize I just love to see a bit more kinky stuff but nothing crazy. I kinda wish I had woman here so we can both masturbate together or touch eachother. Sex would be hard considering the temporary ED. But especially to  have a couple come have sex while I watch. 

But I am careful not to do this often or for multiple days. At most ive done is 2 days. I am making sure I drink plenty of liquids and take my vitamins. And eat some high calorie foods even if I don't want anything.  But reading peoples posts on here makes me feel. Not alone.  And reading the bad side effects keep me from going on any crazy binges.

But most people dont know anything about it besides what they might have seen on TV and in movies. For good reason too. Most people know to stay away from it and have enough sense to know that it's not worth finding out for themselves and those people are smarter than they may even know. This post is for those who are curious and those who have once wondered. 

I suppose that its worth a little background in case some of you dont know the first thing about this drug. Heroin, a.k.a. diacetylmorphine, is an analgesic substance in the opioid class of drugs. It is derived from the opium poppy plant and it is prized by many as a recreational drug of choice because of its ideal mix of euphoriant effects, and having fewer side effects when compared to other opioids. It is a very strong CNS depressant and it produces an effect that is nearly indistinguishable from that of morphine. It can cause moderate severe physical dependency, and very severe psychological addiction. Overdose can lead to rapid and fatal respiratory depression. In comes in many forms, but the two most commonly seen are black tar heroin which is less pure and contains other active compounds from the opium poppy, and the more pure East coast powder or ECP. It can be smoked, snorted, eaten, rectally inserted, or injected. Injection and snorting lead to the vast majority of heroin injuries and deaths. Overtime it has been more and more increasingly mixed with fentanyl. 

So what is it like to be addicted to heroin? Depends on a few different factors but one thing is almost for certain. It usually causes a great deal of suffering and pain in its users, sooner or later. It is statistically one of the most addicting recreational drugs out there because nearly 1 in 4 people who tries heroin at least once, will go on to form an addiction at some point in their life. Despite what many people may think, heroin addiction does not happen quickly or after the first use. The high is regarded by most to be extremely pleasurable and people who try it are likely to want to try it again. Heroin has an uncanny ability to rid somebody of not only physical pain, but psychological pain and this is incredibly seductive to nearly all humans. 

The problems start to set in as a person continues to try it more and more. Its very deceptive and youd be surprised to find that there is initially little to no side effects or negative consequences, even when it is used everyday for a few weeks. At this point, most people are not yet aware that they have started to become psychologically addicted to heroin because they feel like they are still in control and they are oblivious to the increasing pattern of excuses that the brain keeps making for itself to use again. Eventually, you begin justifying all these different excuses to use more, until you've started using it daily or nearly everyday. 

The effects of heroin's high has a way of jading a person's judgement and ability to reason. People may briefly snap out of it and suddenly find that they have been using heroin everyday for weeks and they have been behaving differently than normal. This realization is usually short lived and the falls right back into the same cloudy vision. 

Generally speaking, if a person begins using heroin at least 5 - 7 days a week for about 3 or more consecutive weeks, they may be startled to find that they now feel a bit off on days when they have not had any. A bit sickly even. And this is where physical dependence starts to come out of the woodwork and when heroin addiction starts to pick up the pace. Most people dont even notice the development of withdrawal symptoms until the symptoms have become much more severe. 

Heroin withdrawal is almost too hard to describe to somebody who has never experienced it. In layman terms, it is somewhat like a flu but only on the surface. It doesnt seem like much at first although its definitely not comfortable. A new addict will quickly learn the name of the game and what will soon be a new way of life for them. The rules are simple. If you have dope, you're okay for now. If you dont have dope, youre gonna be sick. At first, you might be okay for roughly 24 hours after your last dose before the sickness starts to set in. But the window of time between your last dose and the start of the sickness, gets shorter and shorter as you continue using. 

If youve never experienced the withdrawal of heroin, then you wont understand just how bad it really is by just simply reading a list of the symptoms. Its more than that. It does something strange to your soul and to the fundamental core of who you are as a person. This addiction is a widespread assault on your mind and body that hijacks the parts of the brain that normally deal with our survival instincts, sub-conscience and primal urges. Your body desperately struggles to re-learn everything that it knows and eventually it is unable to function at all without the presence of heroin in the blood. When the blood concentration of heroin dips below a certain threshold level, you enter withdrawal. Without heroin, your pain receptors begin malfunctioning and firing sporadically, resulting in pain throughout the body. Your gastrointestinal systems are suddenly left with no instructions and cease to function, resulting in nausea, vomiting, indigestion, gas, bloating and  diarrhea. Your throat and sinuses stop controlling mucous and so production runs out of control resulting in runny nose, congestion, sneezing, coughing, and thick mucous in the back of ones throat that makes it difficult to swallow. Sleeping becomes 100% impossible and nothing more than an excruciating loop of tossing and turning and bouncing your leg and cold sweats, and back pain. 

This is just the beginning. You will soon learn to fear the ""dopesickness"" more than anything you've feared before. Enduring the withdrawal for any length of time is no longer an option it seems like. You soon devote every ounce of your being to not getting sick. Keeping your head above the water is now more important than anything you used to value. This means that giving up your belongings, relationships and dignity seems justifiable. Because your fear of dopesickness becomes greater than the love you ever had for any of these things. It stills pains you to give up all these things and you hate yourself for doing it everytime, but you now live in extreme fear of the withdrawals. You have become enslaved to a process and a drug that has taken everything away from you. You will walk for miles and hours, you will put off bills and responsibilities. You will abandon your loved ones. You will give up jobs. You will sell your own blood. You will do torturous chores for people. You will take apart your entire life, piece by piece until there is nothing left of you.

This is a post I am making purely to explain to people my personal experience with the infamous 'Kethole', I hope that with this post I can enlighten people on the topic, and maybe even change some people's minds about the 'dangers' of Ketamine.

**So, to begin, what is Ketamine/Ket?**  Ket is a medicinal tranquiliser typically used on Horses or animals of a similar size. It is sold on the streets - white in colour - in either 'shards' or 'powdered' form. In terms of human consumption, it is a Hallucinogenic Dissociative drug that causes the user to feel somewhat 'spaced out.'

**What does it feel like?** For someone who has never tried Ketamine before, I would most simply compare it to being strongly tipsy - but not drunk - to the point where everything is slowed and your body begins to feel numb or tingly. Personally, it gives me a very happy mentality and also gives me strong 'love-buzz' which is something more commonly associated with MDMA.

**What is the Kethole?** The Kethole, or 'K-Hole' is the point in which you have consumed your bodies specific limit of Ketamine. This is the point in which you become proper sedated by the drug, and in most cases you lose complete control of your body. This is because, as stated before,, Ket is normally used as a Tranquiliser, and so when you breach your bodies limit you hit a stage of tranquility. 

**Is the Kethole scary/bad?** To answer simply, no. The Kethole follows similar rules to a bad Acid trip, in which it only becomes scary or negative when you convince yourself of that. Personally, my Ketholes are very peaceful, and in my head everything becomes Comic Book-like. What I mean by that is, I physically can't move my body but everyone who speaks to me has a Speech Bubble above their heads and things appear as though they are sketched/drawn rather than real.

**What does it look like?** To everyone else, you will most likely be frozen in place. Staring into space is very common, and another thing that tends to happen is that you will repeatedly complete an action as though you are a robot programmed to do so. For example, if you went into a Kethole while texting, your fingers would probably continue moving as if they were typing a few letters.

I take 450mg moclobemide daily and I don‘t feel much of the effects except for being more stable and that I can‘t get stimulated anymore. Depression as negative thoughts might be reduced for sure but that's also feeling like emotional numbness right now. The first effective dosage for anxiety is 600mg, so I don't know if this depressive feeling of anhedonia and no stimulation comes from the moclobemide or it might have another background.

I‘m at the most beautiful place in Southern France right now for holiday, wonderful beaches and pretty landscapes. All my people I‘m with really enjoy it all but for me everything seems kind of boring like nothing can stimulate me.

I don‘t know it also might be because I‘m a lot on my smartphone as social and digital media are very stimulating and give me something. My people here are the same, of course, the youth, they spend even more time on their phones but they talk about how much they enjoy it and how incredible it is here. The most easy things are hard for me, showering etc. I seem just so understimulated and nothing gives me drive, interest or stimulation. That‘s how I would describe it. Kind of emotional numbness but I can still cry if I focus on it, it‘s not real sadness, as I don't feel sadness anymore - which is kind of positive and antidepressive effect of the moclobemide I'd say.

Laughing is hard, being interested in people and conversations is hard, having passion and fun is hard, getting drive for anything is hard. I don‘t know. Depression is less, social anxiety a bit too, sure but where‘s the fun, interest, passion and stimulation that makes life enjoyable? I just feel kind of depressed too right now but not on a sad depressive way, more on a anhedonic and dysfunctional, pathological inhibiting passionless, interestless, and driveless.

Anyone experienced the same? Any tips for me? What can I do against this horrible feeling of not feeling any emotions, just numbness and no stimulation at all from nothing I use my phone less and less and I don‘t masturbate anymore even if that‘s very stimulating too, maybe too much, and it‘s better for my dopamine I guess.

For a little background... I always was a little bit curious about it. I had multiple friends who smoked and asked me if I want to try but I always refused because I felt like it’s not the right moment until now. I also thought ,,It sounds fun but I just can’t imagine me being high,,. I met my boyfriend almost 8 months ago.  He’s a very responsible drug user and has been open about smoking weed, ever since we started talking. He said once that he doesn’t expect me to ever smoke but if I ever would want to try, he would do it with me. So no pressure from his side. I didn’t thought it’ll be in near future that I’ll ever try it but the moment was right. We had a nice day and watched the sunset, he smoked and as a joke asked me if I want to try. I got curious. He said I can try vaporizer later when we are home, I said yes. I vaped and he asked me if I feel anything, in response to that I started laughing. It was the biggest urge to laugh I ever had and I couldn’t stop, my ribs were hurting but it just felt nice. I laid down on the bed and we waited, after I didn’t feel anything else for long time we decided to smoke a small joint. At first I felt kinda wonky on my feet and my body felt intense like never before but I didn’t think  it’s the weed. My boyfriend told me he’s going to toilet really fast and left me alone for a minute in his room. I sat there on the bed and it hit. At first I just wondered why everything was so slow, then the realization came...Just some time ago I smoked weed it has to be that. I panicked a little bit and looked at the door hoping he’ll come back soon, I was like a kid that lost it’s mom in a grocery shop. When I saw him coming up the stairs I instantly felt safer. I told him how I felt and he reassured me that everything’s alright, we cuddled and listened to some music. It felt amazing. From now and then I had a weird feeling of snapping back to normal and then zoning back into it. If I could compare that feeling of being high to anything, I’d say it’s almost like dreaming. At one point I had to pee and was so scared to go to bathroom because I thought that I’m in a dream and will pee the bed, that was of course bullshit haha. I felt so overwhelmed in the best possible way. My boyfriend asked me multiple times if I feel alright and overall made sure I’m feeling good. I can’t possibly imagine anyone better to smoke weed with for the first time, it reassured me how much I can trust him and how close we are. I still can’t believe I did it but I don’t regret anything it was an overall good experience and even thought I still ,,can’t imagine me being high,, I’m sure I’ll repeat that sometime.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,698765,public,confidence,self,First time smoking weed,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/i2jjuy/first_time_smoking_weed/,no_ads,0.0,1596430486.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I’ve spent the past 6 years of my life using pain medicine daily. Vicodin and Percocet specially. All legal through pain management doctors. Never abused them, hell I cycled myself on and off just to make sure I never needed higher doses. Specifically used them to do daily functions gym, school, sleep, etc. 
Well in the last year I’ve moved to a new state and I guess I never really thought the transition through totally. It’s pretty much impossible to find a doctor near me to continue. Even with prior records of my injury, that is pretty much only treated with pain meds, they won’t take new patients. I’ve tried getting through it but I’ve burned all my reserves and the Kratom I’ve tried subbing instead no longer works like I need it to. Either I don’t take enough and I’m in incredible pain at work or I take too much and I’m useless. I hate this feeling but I’m lost on what my next move should be. If anyone has any tips they could let me in on through private chat or comments I’d really appreciate it.

So this weekend I wanted to do it again, and I did.. but it was definitely not the same.

I now have experience with 5-MEO-DMT, DMT, LSD (up to 800ug), ETH-LAD, 2CB, 4-ACO-DMT, Bromo-Dragonfly, NBOMe, an Unknown DOx chemical, 3-MEO-PCP, etc. I’m by no means a hardened psych user but have tried a range of chemicals at different doses in different environments. In terms of opiates I had OxyContin after I got stabbed and I exceeded the medical dose (I see how people get hooked after a legitimate prescription) but apart from that I have very little experience with Opiate use.

I aimed to reach the opiate psychedelic state where you can lucid dream, it’s a perfect method of self exploration and can be a gentler spiritual trip than typical psychs. Psychs are like getting lost in the wild where in my experience opiates are like going on a safari, where you can view everything from the safety of the tour vehicle.

I decided I would snort the heroin but wanted to reach the “nod” as they call it, so I purchased a small quantity of Fentanyl to mix in. I proceeded to take small lines to induce the lucid state. I laid back on my bed with headphones in and put on a pre made playlist. I began to feel like my bed was in the middle of a dessert, I could feel he sun light on me, I began to feel quite hot and a little uncomfortable so I took 80mg of benadryl.

The delusion of a desert intensified and I heard Arabic people talking from far away. A much sadder song began to play an I felt oddly sad but at the same to time more comfortable and euphoric than I’ve ever felt before. I thought on my out look to money and why I’m never satisfied despite making a good amount and I put a lot of thought into mistakes I’ve made throughout my life and what led me to make many significant choices. It resulted in me realising how much good some bad choices had actually resulted in.

I felt like I was in an Egyptian market, I could see that I was in a crowded alley and I was browsing my memory’s, I had my eyes shut at this point and I was looking out over miles of sand dunes and in the very distance I could see pyramids, I don’t remember this bit very well though. I know that it helped me gain a lot of perspective though. The hiss of pipes in my house made made me feel like there was a snake behind me. Oddly enough a friend a few weeks later sold me out.

The trip began to slowly wind down after this, I experienced some huge time dilation as it felt like only 20mins but an eternity at the same time, when in reality it had just been hours. Weird but possibly the Benadryl is partly responsible for that. I smoked several cigs and then made a late night meal, opiates give me the munchies but I don’t really like eating on them as it makes me a little nauseous. I will also add that while this trip was powerful, I was obviously always aware I wasn’t in Egypt and could of properly snapped out of it to an extent. I achieved the experience by zoning out and I would un focus my eyes. An easy way for me to intensify any trip. The real visions of Egypt is when I had my eyes shut but still got visuals with my eyes open.

I believe that this trip was largely impacted by that I was quite young at the time and had been playing a lot of Assassins creed Origins, which probably was responsible for me thinking about Egypt. Also the way Heroin makes you feel warm made me think of a hot country and I also think 80mg of Benadryl intensified the whole experience and took the Egypt delusion to a new level of realism. Opiates provide a different trip with different visuals and a less intense headspace but still can achieve a spiritual experience, they can for me at least. With Opioids you have to work hard to concentrate on confronting your problems where with psychs sometimes people do the opposite and try hard to not confront their problems

And finally, in this post I did not go into how good heroin felt as I don’t really want to advertise heroin/fentanyl or opiates in general and it was not really the point of the post.

Your meant to be how you were born so if your actually depressed you should start finding ways to fix it. No it won’t be fixed in a week but if you keep trying and going to a therapist often and talking about your problems and finding hobbies and people to keep your mind off the depressing thoughts you could start to naturally feel better over the course of a couple years. Or you can take the easy way out and put yourself on a medication that fucks with your serotonin. You don’t act the same when your on it. I was forced on trazadone for about 2 months and I hate to say that I got super dependent. Without them I wanted to kill my self and I couldn’t sleep without having super negative thoughts but you know what? Before I was prescribed that I was way happier then I was after. Even now after over a year of not taking it I still feel like I’ve changed from when I’ve never taken it to now.

The last time I used cocaine was two days ago; I am going to be drugs tested around late December with a hair follicle based test.

My question is, if I shave all my hair repeatedly leaving a month before the test, as well as dye and bleach my hair, what are the chances that the cocaine will be detected in the hair? I am in no way a heavy user, maybe once every month or so if that. I am a very heavy drinker (nearly every day) and have learned from my research that this prolongs the breakdown of the metabolites.

TLDR; very infrequently use cocaine, heavy drinker. If I shave my hair consistently and dye and bleach my hair leaving a month before the test, what are the chances of a positive result?

My place of refuge and safety. Free from all of the judgmental eyes that turned my rebellious antics into questionable behavior. Here I could roam without a leash. Tonight was going to be special. We went out this morning to purchase caffeine pills and ziplock bags for a friend we were picking up from the airport around noon. Eli. He was landing at Philadelphia international, returning from a six month stay overseas. His father owned a successful jewelry store in center city. He gave us the keys to one of his Mercedes-Benz and instructed us to pick him up and have the supplies ready when he lands. If we did so, he would have a nice surprise for us. We did exactly as he instructed.

Upon arrival Jay and I were forced into the back seat, with nobody riding shotgun. We were immediately bombarded with stories of how amazing life is outside of America. Once the rants and raves were finished, he revealed the surprise. He had some LSD that he was willing to share with us, free of charge, he just didn't want to trip alone. He also said he had a shit-fucking-ton of cocaine back at his apartment that he would share as well. He needed to cut it with the caffeine pills and other white ingredients we had procured earlier in the day. While he bagged it out, we would be able to sample as much as we wanted. This plan made us very happy. After gathering the drugs at Eli's apartment, we returned to the firehouse.

The fucks were going about their usual business. There was to be a party this evening, so chaos would ensue. After hours we would retreat to the rooftop, inviting only a few, and discuss the blueprints of how we'd become better people; ultimately never planning to change. Talking about it seemed good enough at the time. As long as we *believe* we were good, that's all that mattered. We dropped acid and a few minutes later found ourselves on the twin couches of buyers remorse.

""Thirty?"", asked Ken.

""Sure"", I replied, forking over a twenty dollar note.

Jay and I would share. We had moved on from the days of smoking pills, now we snort the little fuckers. The euphoria was a nice touch as we were burning through the atmosphere of another world entirely. Reality began to fray. Eli, Jay, and I were quickly flipping through the book that is our existence; the three of us on the same page. The fucks were on the outside, and we wouldn't dare allow them to look in. After a few minutes, we went to the third floor, leaving the fucks to deal with the party on their own. We wanted no part in that bullshit. We were only interested in the facts. We climbed the rickety staircase and got down to brass tacks.

Eli began to cut up the cocaine with a large knife. He slowly shaved the white rock into powder. Every ten minutes or so we would put some in our nose. It was during this disgusting free for all that we began to feel invincible. Usually a good acid trip will show you the beauty and fragility of life, but we had tainted our trip with poisonous pharmaceuticals. We bore suits of armor fashioned from cocaine. Toss in a bit of Xanax and.. Bam! In our hands we held a newly formed promissory note guaranteeing that we wouldn't have a bad trip. In the old days, all we needed to do was think positive.

""Watch out, be careful!""

We don't want to hear about it. We ignore it -- that sound, a voice -- warning us of the view from halfway down. A flood of fond endorphins brings a calm that knows no equal. Pills. We're flying now, we see things much more clear than from the ground. It's all okay, it would be, were we not now halfway down.

We can hear the party raging downstairs. We want no part in that world. It was a good party. It really was. These parties don't host the usual keg, nor the flat warm Coors that typically fill the stale air of these Philadelphian basements. This party has been brought to you by Stella. STELLA!!! I wanted to go downstairs and grab a bottle. I wanted to tap the mini-fridge of Corona Extra only available to us important people. Squeeze a lime into the cold beer and watch the juice slowly disappear into nothingness. The lime don't know, lime didn't ask to be born.

As the party slowed down the fucks ran to their instruments and started performing. The way they moved seemed almost robotic. Ugh. Through my distorted vision they looked like the animatronic Chuck E. Cheese band. Gross. I clenched my fists and rubbed the disgusting scene from my eyes. They were undoubtably skillful musicians. Two lonely folks trying to hate themselves a little bit less. We're better than them. We know we're small and miserable. That makes us better. I think. Maybe we *are* them. I'm not so sure. The thunderous music vibrated the rotting walls of the house. These walls are fond of hosting mayhem. It's structure is a cruel and uncaring void. If these walls could talk, what would they say?

Does this stupid rock I push everyday have any meaning? Any purpose? Maybe the key to being happy isn't to search for meaning, but to keep ourselves busy with unimportant nonsense. Have I just been surrounding myself with distractions so I don't have to be alone with myself? This is *too much* man. We need to replenish our armor. I feel weak. We retreat to the upper levels. We did more blow and took more Xanax.

*Thrash to break from gravity, what now could slow the drop? What I'd give for toes to touch the safety back atop. Is this it? Is the deed done? Silence drowns the sound. Before I leaped I should have seen the view form halfway down.*

Now I'm back on campus. How the fuck did I get here? What's going on? I can't remember. My nerves are rattled. I can't sit still. Fuck. Goddamn drugs, I need to calm down. Pull it together man. I rode my skateboard over to Steve's house on 18th street. It was a beautiful morning. We had made a date to share a blunt. Yes, a blunt. Then I'll be able to relax and go to sleep. I was beyond normal fatigue. We shared our blunt and had some laughs, but now it's time to go. What was that voice saying? Something halfway down?

I was skating back to my apartment. My attention was everywhere but in front of me. My imagination was running a muck, and I was thinking about all sorts of nonsense. Then, out of nowhere, the voice returns. Only, it wasn't a voice at all. A tap on the shoulder maybe. I looked up. Right in front of me was a huge metal monster, barreling towards me with no intention of stopping. A Ford explorer. I gave a little hop and a skip. This small maneuver allowed me to be struck above the hood, giving my ass a proper spanking. I was then tossed into the windshield and over the car entirely. It's always right on the edge, like flying through the air, that the strange music starts to play.

I've changed my mind. I don't want this. I had already said fuck it though. Shit. Do my words actually have meaning? Did I really leap? Was the deed really done? I thought I was lying. A story. Yes, a silly story, that's all this is. My wild imagination. Like a dream. Wake up!

I tried to listen, but my ears were full of muff, silence drowned the sound. Before I leaped I should have seen the view from halfway down. I really should have thought about the view from halfway down. Find your peace. I wish I would have known about the view from halfway down.

Wiggle your fingers and toes! I'm still here, leaning against a parked car, watching 18th street spin like a drunken room. That hop and skip had saved my life. Maybe it was the tap on the shoulder. All I know is that I have a full recollection of an event that never took place. I could feel the grill of that Ford Explorer hitting me head on; no hop, no skip. I could feel my chest compress and ribs crack. Gasping for air I lay on the ground as my lungs fill with blood. As I take my last few breaths I can see the cloudless blue sky above me. I'm wondering where I'll go from here, if anywhere. Is there another side? Is this it? Like I said, wild imagination.

I had always longed to be free from the leash to which I'm bound, but fuck that shit if it means dealing with the view from halfway down.

I don’t know what I am trying to say, but I know deep down I still have a grip on it but at times I‘ve been able to see how I could easily lose that grip if I start doing anything more than just vyvanse (and nicotine) each day and weed on weekends.

This happened 2½ yrs back but the HPPD and cognitive impairments didn't go away yet. Yes, both are MAO-I inhibitors and I had serotonin syndrome for sure. After the combo wore out, the HPPD started and since then, I've been experiencing intense bipolar shifts, either too manic or too depressed. And this is paired with a certain level of HPPD. 

To describe the HPPD, it's like I can still see tracers of bright things moving in the dark and my vision's focus kinda gets blurred and starts breathing. 

After quitting DXM, I switched to weed and out of nowhere, it put me in a spiralling path of dissociation paired with unbearable anxiety, psychosis, derealisation and depersonalisation. And these all seem to be interlinked with depression. The reality is very plastic and everything sorta feels like setup against me. 

Right now, I stopped smoking weed too and just sticking with the good ol' alcohol. But yet, this seems like a cycle. All those mental illnesses and cognitive impairments mentioned above subside after a certain period of time and all of a sudden, they are back. For example, right now my headspace is clear, train of thoughts is lucid and I've got a good grip of reality. But I've had this clear state earlier too and out of nowhere the bad time starts. 

I don't want this cycle to repeat. Any leads?

Hi. I ordered 22g of High Hawaiians (psilocybe Tampelandia) and I want to trip on Friday (writing this on sunday) I have tripped before on truffles with a rather low dose (5g Psilocybe Tampanensis) and i have quite a bit of experience with LSD.

I told a friend of mine im going to trip, he was really interested in taking a low dose and as i have the truffles already there I offered him to take some with me.

Now to my questions:

\-If i trip on 3g psilocybe Tampelandia is there going to be any significant effect? I've heard that they are quite strong.

\-Can I trip 5 days later without having a lessened experience, considering the low dose I'm going to trip on tomorrow?

\-On Friday we are going to do 6g. Its going to be my friends first time with psilocybin, though not psychedelics. Is that a good dosage for beginners?

Personally I’ve never ‘broken through’ as in I’ve never become physically incapacitated from smoking it because I don’t know anyone who has well enough to have them watch over me when I do it and so i developed my own way of doing it that makes me trip (I get visuals so I know it works) without becoming incapacitated (ask in the comments if you’re curious). I have nonetheless seen some fkn incredible things tho and am wondering what others have seen/experienced.

When I trip I usually close my eyes and meditate on what I see and when I do that I get transported to something like a portal realm which I think is in between the reality we usually see and somewhere else. It’s a seemingly boundless realm with a white background where in the distance there’s energy flowing in a similar aesthetic to things you see in Mexican Dias de Muertos artwork but with a modern twist. Everything’s white, blue and purple and the aesthetic strikes me as something from a society/world far more advanced than our own. A big and mighty humanoid figure then appears whose face look like a Dias de Muertos mask. He’ll extend his hand as if inviting me to take it so he can take me somewhere and show me some things. I can’t interact with him in that state but I’ve interpreted it as him either inviting me to ‘break through’ at some point with a bigger dose so he can take me through the portal, or, and this next bit i think may have something to do with the theory that endogenous DMT is released when living things die and so is a ‘portal’ to the afterlife, to go with him when I die and perhaps only in death can true enlightenment be achieved. This has imbued more gravitas to the Dias de Muertos for me

I don’t always close my eyes and meditate when I smoke DMT tho and sometimes I’ll just go about my day. When I do that the world around me changes a bit and is imbued with that aforementioned sort of aesthetic, everything has a white, blue and purple tint and things look super-modern and futuristic but things don’t change dramatically and trees are still trees and cars are still cars, etc. Really strangely tho, so I wear camo sometimes and have some ‘real tree’ camo garms, and when I’m on DMT and look at those garms the print changes completely. I don’t see trees anymore and instead I just see a repeating super-modern and simple white, blue and purple print. I’ve been meaning to take it down and will do it the next time I trip but have yet to do it. This part I have trouble thinking of explanations and connections for

All in all I find it odd that I didn’t see gnomes and mushrooms like I’ve heard various people say they saw but I guess the experience can be really different for everyone and is why I’m posting this thread. Personally the Dias de Muertos and futuristic aesthetics connections I’ve experienced make more sense to me for when you’re on DMT than gnomes and shit and maybe that’s a factor. Idk.

So every time I take xanax and mix it with alcohol for a number of days, no matter how I try “taper” off I get a withdrawal seizure. I’ve had around 9 now. However this time was different to the others as I only combined them both for one day instead of multiple, as well as taking less than normal. I took 6mg of prescription xanax (they were sealed etc so legit prescription) and mixed it with three beers and annoyingly passed out. I’m worried now that I have a seizure due but at the same time I think well you only did it for one day so did that even give your body a chance to get used to it in order to get a withdrawal seizure?

I was beginning to understand that things could be understood on an entirely new level of understanding. Ya follow?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat\'s when I felt myself expanding. *Darkness. I was the universe. Light. I was the outside of the universe. I was everything. I was nothing. I was the Yin and I was the Yang. A billionth of a fraction of a nanosecond passed, infinite universes born and died. Time didn\'t exist. Then I\'m shaken, I\'m a glowing blueish white fetus with an enormous head in a glass box. I shift.  I\'m outside the universe again, floating, alone although I can feel infinite presences. A voice: ""We\'ll kill him if he comes back again"".*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I think back on the time when I was a human being, with reasons to take a magic truffle journey to try and find out what troubled me so much. ""What did trouble me?"" I wonder. But I quickly realize that it doesn\'t matter. Nothing matters. It all makes perfect sense and none of it matters at all. I feel infinitely   euphoric.  I am everything. I am nothing. I feel another presence nearby, warm, friendly, She calls me. We communicate for a short time, then I feel a sensation on my universe, She tells me: ""But you need to go back now, for you need to pee."" The sensation on my universe becomes a warmth inside my bladder. I need to pee.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I\'m several planes of existence away from the one I\'m typing this story from, and I have no desire whatsoever to leave this beautiful presence, but I\'m instantly jerked a few levels back at the realization of my earthly body. I fight, I crouch down, gathering all of the power of the earth of whatever plane I was on and leap back up towards Her glory, falling well short.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI opened my eyes, to see the oriental hand fan above me which was absolutely alive, I was instantly absorbed into it seeing fractals, clouds floating through a baby blue sky, bright green leaves on trees swaying in the wind, wooden canoes drifting on the peaceful turquoise river water. *Water. I need to pee.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started fighting again, but this time I was aware enough to fight to the existence where I could lift my ass out of bed, so I wouldn\'t piss in it. It was a monstrous struggle but I got to the state where I was able to operate my body enough to make my way to the toilet, and took a gloriously magnificent whizz. Absolutely everything in sight had microscopic cracks in it, out of which the brightest rainbow colored fractals were pouring, with every conceivable color in the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nBefore returning to bed I remember the document on my laptop where I started writing a trip report, I realize I need to leave a message for my loved ones in case I get lost in this new reality. M*aking it back was not easy.* It reads:  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;10:07 I get it, I get everything, ego death just happened, i can not express it, youve got to come see it. Everything makes sense. Thats the only important thing.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The mind is an incredibly powerful thing, we need to find out how to harness its power  \n\n  \n\nAfter which I immediately retreat back to bed fully intent on returning to the unquestionably more real reality where I could continue to communicate with Her and understand all of this life\'s mysteries.\n\nThe moment I close my eyes I start expanding again, *I feel like an accordion being pulled apart but every groove is an entirely different layer of reality and I\'m sliding through each one seamlessly until I am everything again. She returns and we communicate for a while more.  I am something that resembles a DNA strand in the same place as where I am a fetus, but on a platform, not in the glass box. The place is dark, with dim white lighting, and grey metal boundaries an infinite distance away.*\n\n*I remember an entity, someone I love, I feel their presence, it fills me with euphoria, I am ecstatic, we dance as we fly through outer space, stars trailing past as we gently fly by at unimaginable speed. Then I remember what was missing, and I explode. I am no longer in that reality, I am no longer everything, nor am I me. I am still flying through space, haphazardly now, dodging stars as they draw nearer, I see a bright light ahead, it calls me, I feel a warmth inside. I direct myself to the light, I feel warmer as it comes nearer. I realize too late what it is, a star, the warmth grows warmer inside me as I collide with the star, I realize where the warmth is coming from as I explode again and open my eyes. I need to pee.*\n\nIt took another incredible struggle to lift myself out of bed and get to the toilet, the lid now had a lions head shaded into it which was alive, I no longer saw colorful fractals now but instead everything had a darker shade to it, like I was dreaming. I managed to get back to bed and close my eyes again.\n\nI was able to retain some of my consciousness and try to understand what is happening, I tried to realize which reality is real and why I exist when I noticed I was flying through space, quite dangerously, at incredible speed, dodging stars as they appeared ahead of me, then I felt a warmth growing inside of me, as I focused on that, I didn\'t see the star directly ahead of me. I saw it at the last second and the warmth inside me exploded. *I open my eyes, I need to pee.*\n\nThis repeated countless times and each time I slowly put together that I was stuck in a loop, I painstakingly formed enough conscious thought to understand that I was supposed to be in one of these two realities, but not both. When I suddenly found myself inside my brain, only there was something covering everything, and I knew that something was mycelium. I managed to remember that I had taken truffles, and that they were causing this through the idea of mycelium having taken over my mind.

That's right, I said it. Weed does nothing positive for me. It makes me anxious, and I often end up going non-verbal. All my friends and my immediate family all love it. They pressure me all the time to buy weed and smoke it. If I never saw another nug in my life I'd be happy. I wish weed made me relax, but it's extremely bad for my mental health.

I'm so tired of seeing these reminders of all the ones I've lost every time I wake up and just try to cope.

We used to dump everything out together every time we got home. We'd always do everything together. You promised me you'd never use alone, because I was so terrified of losing you. You were such a novice. I wasn't. I was a years long junkie, you a pill popping college student. 

I take responsibility. I think every fucking day about that day we met. Wishing I'd just walked past you. Not walked up to you and asked where the dining hall was even though we both knew I knew where it was and was just looking for an excuse to talk to you. 

I think about your mother. She had no idea. The look on her face when she walked in and saw the scene. She thought I had just come home from work late and had no idea what was going on. She was right about the first part. 

I still think about that text you sent me. 

""You gonna be home late?""

You sent that because you were embarrassed. You wanted to get a dose in before I got home. You hadn't gotten the chance to get to where you wanted due to your long day of classes. Embarrassed thinking your junkie of a boyfriend would judge you for this. You know I wanted you off what I was on, and that I only ever let you do it when I was there. 

We only ever did it together, that was the plan. 

I know you were doing it by yourself, and I only know this because I went through your phone before your mom came and deleted the texts to my dealer. She lied. She said you never texted her. Of course. I could see how many times you picked up. How much you got. And how fast you spiraled.

The texts were recoverable somehow, and here I am far too late at night having finally recovered them.

I went into this relationship knowing before I ever made a move on her that she’s on suboxone, but that she’s always tried to control it and get by on as little as possible, I myself am not a drug user at all, I’ve always been able to say no and I have a hard time truly understanding it to it’s full extent, but I try my damnedest to be understanding and help if I can and I made that clear to her in the beginning because I wanted to help her and support her as much as I could. 

Now we’ve drank here and there and I know how alcohol usually affects her, but here lately (as of about the last week) she’s not been sleeping at all, she’s had an accumulated total of about 6 hours of sleep in the last 7 days, and she’s been “cleaning” her house non-stop, but it’s a huge mess every time I’m over there because she’s just rummaging and moving things that don’t need to be messed with. We used to have sex 1-2 times a day every day for 8 months, we never seemed to get tired of each other... and we always made sure to go to bed with each other because we don’t like sleeping without each other... we haven’t even laid down in the same bed in a week, every time I touch her or try to get her in the mood she shuts it down, and tonight after 2 beers (she’s not a lightweight, I’ve seen her down a bottle of whiskey and still hold a conversation) she was so out of it she couldn’t even muster up a whole mumble to answer me, I finally got enough out of her to ask her if she would go to bed with me and she asked me to come to bed with her, but her bed needed cleaning off so I said she’s gotta do that first and she mumbled “mhmm”... soon as we walk in the door she doesn’t take off her heels, drop her purse or anything, she dives into the couch and is out cold snoring, I tried everything up to wringing our a cold wash cloth on her face to wake her up... and nothing.

It is not the best.

&amp;#x200B;

I made the worst decision (series) of my life ever about 3-4 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to go to parties with my friends sometimes and I sniffed speed (meth?) drug on these events such as before.

There are only few parties in the year. I am not drug addicted person. I don't use it in my everydays.

I am an average young man. I got work, hobbies, family life, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the story.....

&amp;#x200B;

....These parties were amazing and there wasn't any problem of it except that baaaaad next day of course. I always suffered, I couldn't do anything which can help so I decided to search the best one.

I started car repairing, -after the next party- I was doing housework, etc.

These things hooked me but I still felt so badly.

&amp;#x200B;

Until -I don't remember which but- one day after arriving party I JUST STARTED WATCHIG PORN.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a really dangerous step because I had problems with porn in the past but I defeated it with my first girfriend. But why not? Just give a try! ONLY TODAY of course.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could never do that!!!!! :'''(

&amp;#x200B;

Because it was amazing!! That dopamine rush was better than anything.

I tought I found the perfect thing to do after the parties. I watched porn straight 8-10 hours that next day.

&amp;#x200B;

So when the next party ended and I arrived home and the first thing was that I switched on porn.

&amp;#x200B;

After a while it also started get little boring so I watched more and more types of it for a long time. I get from vanilla to bdsm and WORSE!!! Femdom, cuckold  Sissy hypnos and other awful crazy sh\*ts...

&amp;#x200B;

I am a straight guy, I love women, I had many girlfriends but this time nowadays it makes me want to suck cock and any other pervert things when I'm high on speed....

&amp;#x200B;

I made pictures of me with panties and cock cage and these were as good as those I saw on the internet, because I have a little bit girly body. It turned me on more and more.

&amp;#x200B;

...ONLY BECAUSE OF DAMN DOPAMINE!

&amp;#x200B;

After every occasions like this I deleted everything and promised myself I will never do this again but next time THE SAME HAPPENED.

&amp;#x200B;

It washed my mind!!!! It almost convinced me about that I am a bitch who needs to be feminized. Sometimes I watched this type of porn SOBER. (at this point I didn't know what I'm doing) But after a while I just stopped it and ask WHAT THE F\_CK I'M DOING?!?!

&amp;#x200B;

In the earlier years of this sh\*t unfortunately I didn't know it is dangerous as hell.

I tought it was only a single mistake.

(BUT EVERYTIME?!?!?!)

&amp;#x200B;

Never ask that: Can it be worse?!

YES

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays when I go to party and sniffing I am ok and I feel good but after some hours these porn scenes coming and I get DAMN HORNY so I can't defeat them. Sometimes I lock myself to the toilet and watching porn. Can't 'not think' about it. I can't have good time with my friends. It makes me want to watch this creepy sh\*t.

&amp;#x200B;

My friends don't know anything about it. They sometimes recognize that I am too quiet and they feel something is wrong with me but don't know the truth.

Sometimes I watch porn in front of them at the party while they doesn't know what I'm doing on my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

When I get sober and this feeling going away, I feel worse than ever after a ""normal"" party..... I feel worse than ever...like a piece of sh\*t I regret it and I promise myself to don't do that again.....

I wish I could get back that suffer what I felt in the past without porn!!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

At a point after few days I didn't feel that bad because I tought I can be strong next time, this is not the real me but now I am really REALLY SCARED because I know next time the same thing will happen....

&amp;#x200B;

I can't go to techno party with my friends anymore, can I? I am not drug addicted and I go to these events very rarely. I just want to feel good on these days.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't accept that when I use speed, I will get fckn horny and I have to watch the porn of hell...

&amp;#x200B;

I tried almost everything.

Before the party I made text messages on my phone to myself like ""DON'T DO IT!"" ""IT IS NOT REAL"" etc.

But didn't worked. The dopamine addict is stronger when I'm high.

&amp;#x200B;

Can somehow speed and porn addict taken apart somehow?!?! Please say yes!!!

&amp;#x200B;

I think my only hope is that I have to talk about this to one of my friends but I am really scared because it is SHAME.

I don't know what they would do with me..

I can't talk about it..

&amp;#x200B;

This thing happened to me step by step, not one day to other. This is why so hard to quit this bad habit which took power on me.

&amp;#x200B;

Why this happened only to me? The all of others are OK and searching the web there are only few similar cases.

&amp;#x200B;

How I said, in the past I was a normal, regular porn addict but it ended when I got my first girlfriend. Maybe it happened because of this?

I have willingness to do that?

&amp;#x200B;

Can I ever got back the 'normal me' who sometimes sniffs and go to party, having fun, dancing like other young people?

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't have girlfriend and I watch vanilla porn reguraly. I found NoFap on the internet and I started to treat my problem as others normal porn addict. Maybe if I reset my brain with not watching porn absolutely can help to get rid of it but I am afraid that at the next party this will come again and it will be worse...

&amp;#x200B;

Quitting this drug for a long time would solve it? I don't use it as much now either.. Or it would happen even after a year, or years?!

I don't want to use it when I get old. I wanted to having fun as young.

&amp;#x200B;

Or should I use it more often?? There was no 

consecutive days. I don't know that I would do the same after a day I regretted it.

&amp;#x200B;

Till next time maybe I should go to gym to make my body less girly so it wouldn't remind me to be a ""sissy"" at dopamine rush time.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I shouldn't masturbate in my weekdays to practice abstinence.

&amp;#x200B;

What I should do?!?

I was extremely down before I made the second trip. I have been consuming alcohol throughout the night. It made me depressed, suicidal thoughts were manifesting in my mind. I have made a decision to trip for the second time. I wanted to get more out of it, I thought it would fix my problems. As I was drinking beer I planned to make myself a tea out of 30 grams of dried Amanita Muscaria mushroom caps. For that I had to wait until nobody else was at home, I had to wait until morning. I thought it would be a good idea to trip in nature nearby the forest in which I’ve foraged the mushrooms. The morning came, every resident of the house left and I’ve got to the work of brewing the tea. As I was doing that, I got sober enough to realize that tripping outside, in the forests wasn’t that great of an idea. First of all, it wasn’t ideal because I was about to trip completely alone and any other being would be an unwanted object of interaction. Secondly, if I was to be found by strangers or wildlife it would be a threat which could impact the trip in negative ways. What is more, I wanted to be sober at the time of ingestion. I wanted to make it right this time. I’ve made the tea and decided to take it the day after. I knew exactly how long the house would be empty and I could trip completely by myself. That was the point of the trip, to go through it completely on my own. I knew the risks involved such as vomiting and choking on it, diarrhea, going into manic state of mind and not being able to be conscious in it, might even inflict self harm or even wander out of the house. Even though I understood the risks that might become reality of mine, I didn’t care much as I knew it would all turn out to be the best possible outcome. In other words, I completely trusted the universe as it is and was to take responsibility for what I was going to do. Other day came. I was well rested, well as much as I could’ve been. It was about five minutes past eight in the morning when I began sipping on my A. Muscaria tea which I’ve mixed with black tea so it would go down easier. After 20 minutes of sipping I was done with the tea. I’ve been burping a lot over the course of drinking it and I was feeling nauseous, there was a slight discomfort in my stomach. After finishing the tea I went to have a cigarette and last of the people were to exit the house. I must note I have fast metabolism. As I was smoking I could already feel the effects of the tea. My vision was distorted, I felt kind of weightlessness throughout my body, external temperature changes felt way stronger than usually, after the cigarette I’ve decided to go lie down for the trip. As I went back to the first floor. I felt changes in my motor skills while climbing the stairs. I went to the laptop in my girlfriends room to log what I was experiencing and I felt it was about to hit me extremely hard, so hard, I’ve never experienced such a kick in my life. I knew I had to go lie down and fall into the trip down the rabbit hole. That is exactly what I did, I lied down on the floor. I knew I could vomit throughout the trip so I chose the perfect location for vomiting as it would be an easy clean-up in case I did vomit. I was lying on my side, so I wouldn’t choke on my vomits. As everything started spinning as I closed my eyes, moments passed and I fell into the trip.

TRIP

First thing I could remember was that I was experiencing the same Mind Travel as in the first trip. It threw me into a very weird state. It was pitch black around me, I had no vision, I had no senses whatsoever, all I had was my thoughts, the monologue occurred in which I started questioning who or what I am. First thought to give me clarity was that I had no human body, I started to feel a sensation of energy surge just as in the first trip, but it had borders which were shaped as a rectangle. As I was feeling that energy surging through what I understood to be me, a rectangular shape in vast darkness and emptiness of infinity, it felt agonizing at the moment. I thought I was in hell and it felt as if that moment was occurring for eternity. As I was experiencing complete agony and despair, time passed and I’ve got used to it, it was the moment when I’ve got bored of it when I started questioning what I’m feeling and who I was. The energy surge stopped and there was nothing else left of it, just the dark vastness of nothingness and I’ve found myself to be nobody, no one, nothing… I’ve came to realize my self as nothing… Only thing that persisted was my thoughts… I couldn’t comprehend how could I be nothing and then I jumped into the mind travel loop which led me to comprehend my self as a one. As a variable one, which was after the zero. I then questioned what does it mean to be that one. I then began to see a vision of one cube. Then I understood I was that cube and I felt it wasn’t the end of it. Then, another cube was loaded besides the first one, I then realized I’m not one, not alone after all. Third cube was loaded nearby the second one and then I’ve fell into the mind travel loop once again. It took quite some time until I’ve came to a clear thought that I WAS LIFE. I’ve experienced my self to be life it self in every way possible. As I’ve had this realization, I’ve fell into mind travel loop once again, I remember I found myself to be human! As that realisation occured, what followed was that I had an episode of mind travel in which I had an intercourse for what seemed to be an eternity and after that I´ve experienced multiple human being lives while traveling the mind loop. At some point I saw my true current time self sitting on a bed in my girlfriends´ room and I knew I was being uploaded into that body of mine. It didn´t feel right as the process was occuring. My thoughts were going like this, citing it: this isn’t right, it’s not the time, this isn’t where I have to be, the trip isn’t over. I felt as if I was about to be uploaded but then the process began to go in reverse and I was unloaded and thrown back into the mind travel loop. The trip was going onwards and I was being uploaded into place where I should be, the same body and same spot at a certain time in the universe, the same body lying down in the same pose as in the beginning of the trip. As I was mind travelling back into my reality, I felt the sense of vomit smell. I was wondering wether I choked on my own vomits or not and died, or it all turned out alright. I knew I was about to know the truth. I got fully uploaded into my real body, I could once again see my true current reality. I still felt the vomit smell, I also felt the state of mind where I felt invincible, inmortal, my body felt no pain or other sensations whatsoever, it was weightless. I then rushed to see what time it was. It was 3:42 in the afternoon. After figuring out the time I searched for the vomits, couldn’t find it, I’ve noticed I’ve vomitted on my hoodie which I was wearing at the time, there were no vomits or vomit stains on the floor in a place I was lying on. I’ve noticed my body has moved some ítems in the room, the floor mat which was beside the bed was moved over into the corner, my phone which was charging on the table was hanging on the cord, I’ve even made myself a place to lie down for the end of the trip… I didn’t put much mind into it at the time but I’ve also noticed a stain on the bed, I realised that I’ve vomitted there and I was trying to figure why I don’t see any residue on the floor, I thought my body cleaned everything up, I went out of the room to search tools with which I could’ve cleaned it up. Couldn’t find any. I’ve also found a cat waiting to get in so I’ve let him in but he didn’t stay inside, he asked me to let him out soon. I logged some text into the log I was running before the trip. After that I’ve just went back into the same spot at which I began the trip, I closed my eyes and the trip continued. It seemed as if continuation of the trip occurred both in conscious and sub-conscious. What I mean by that is that I was still tripping but the trip was interconnected with my reality. I saw what I would see if I was just lying on the floor the way I was. I concentrated on looking at my backpack on which there was a word ARENA and three triangular shapes making one triangle. I then began to see that triangle to be a 3 times 3 grid, in one of the cells which was in the left bottom corner I saw my self  lying in a pose at which I was lying. Then that cell got zoomed in and I’ve started seeing lines branching out of it, I’ve began traveling through these branches to find myself in some kind of reality in which I’ve made certain actions, then I was brought back, the cell seemed to fix itself in place, as if it was put in it’s place and started to shine brightly until it got completely white, then, all of the 3 cells of bottom row emitted high concentration of light and it seemed that it was some kind of completion of that row. The view I could see zoomed out and I’ve seen multiple such 3 times 3 grids, some of them were shining white light and some weren’t, as the zoom out was progressing I’ve seen that there’s multiple grids, some of which were complete and others were being built. It seemed as if these 3 times 3 grids were just a fracture of a bigger grid, couldn’t tell the number, but at that moment I understood I was seeing how the three dimensional current time was being built with relative and alternative variations. It seemed as if it was expanding. As my vision got zoomed out even further I saw it, the cell which I saw the first was at the left bottom corner, it seemed as if it was being filled upwards and right until the bigger grid got 50 percent filled. I saw a mirror like grid which got filled 50 percent aswell. That was the moment when the entire grid started to shine bright white light and the view got zoomed out once again, so that I could see that this huge grid was also in another bigger grid and that everything in it was just one piece of a puzzle. The progression occurred and view was zoomed out once again, I saw missing pieces being filled in and making up the NOW, the current time. I saw that it doesn’t even go to x and y axis, it goes in z axis aswell and there were multiple grids which in combination would make up the current time. In other words, multiple pieces of multiple variables were making up multiple variations of realities. The system was complexed and delivered to my understanding as easily as it could. In a way that I would understand what I was observing. I felt as if GOD it self was showing me the foundation of this universe. The view zoomed out progressively as the time passed. I then saw how there was my universe in which I live and besides it multiple other universes. And ofcourse it all was just a piece of the construct of infinity. What I’ve witnessed was a construct of infinity. The exponential growth of it. Well atleast what I could understand through my human being perspective of things. As the view got zoomed out further and further, I saw that everything that I’ve seen, was just a small piece in a letter A of the word ARENA, which was written on my backpack. It made me realize that even the smallest things are a construct of bigger things and that everything is completely intertwined in this reality to make sense. I know it’s difficult to follow, I know it’s difficult to comprehend… I believe the only way to comprehend is to experience it for yourself... I believe that the way that I comprehend this reality and how I was shown the evolution from 0th dimension to 3rd and consecutive dimensions was represented in a way I would understand. I believe that for a different person, different visuals and different sensual experiences would be presented. In a way that the person would understand what a person has to understand to move on forward. But lets get back to the trip, not the conclusions. So I’ve seen that my reality, my universe, multiple universes and what’s above it are just a pixel, a piece of a word ARENA. I then heard that my girlfriend and her mom got back home. I’ve heard the door downstairs being unlocked. I knew I didn’t have much time left. I got up and went into the final position of the trip, the place which my body had prepared for me for the end of the trip. I lied down. I once again could see myself being in a grid, just as I was. The pose I was in. And I saw myself from the ceiling perspective to be filled in as a missing piece, the floor of the room was divided into a grid. And there I was lying on the floor in the final position. It seemed as if that moment, position, was fractured into infinite amount of images which would be used for the construct of the subsequent realities to come. As the process occurred, I was seeing it happening and I was hearing what was happening in my reality. I heard my girlfriend coming upstairs. I knew the trip was about to end. She walked into the room, I didn’t respond for a while, because I had to see how it all fitted in into the picture but as soon as I did, I got out of the trip and responded. The room had a deep vomit smell in it, I told her I was okay and explained her the issues of the vomiting and not being able to find the source of vomits. Later on she found that I vomited on the bed. She cleaned all the mess I’ve made. The trip wasn’t over at that point. I could both be in the current reality and it seemed that my current time thoughts were creating upcoming reality which I could kind of see in my subconscious. It’s very difficult to describe it, believe me. It felt as if I was experiencing current reality but at the same time saw and experienced what was to come depending on my current thoughts. It felt overwhelming. I decided to go out for a smoke in a first floor balcony which was connected to my girlfriends’ room. As I was smoking a cigarette I fell into a state of mind which I could recognize from my previous experience when I was tripping on lysergic acid diethylamide. I’ve got absorbed in it. I’ve began to see the universe in which I was, the view expanded and I saw the co-occuring universes, the view got zoomed out and as I was repeating to myself words: I LOVE THE UNIVERSE in my native language the view was expanding and zooming out so I could see that all of it was a piece constructing 4th dimension. Then it grew into me seeing the consequent dimensions. I’ve finished the last drags of the cigarette, I wasn’t actually smoking, it just burned between my fingers while I was experiencing the view. I went back into the room but the images of dimensional view kept on going, climbing upwards to 5th, 6th, 7th and consequent dimensions. At the moment I could understand and see the constructs of all the dimensions which were above ours 3rd dimension. At some point I’ve seen the 9th dimension, I saw it and I could explain it at the moment, I could comprehend it. It was very weird having such experience. What I’ve experienced throughout the trip was a progression of existence from 0th to 9th dimension. It made me question was there 10th dimension. I couldn’t see past 9th dimension though… But I am certain the progression is still going on and 9th dimension isn’t the limit.

POST-TRIP 

How I understand it right now is that it’s growing exponentially in every direction possible. For instance as I was going through a phase of discovering my self to be 0 to one, later on discovering there’s more to it, I can now see the sequence. In my eyes the sequence began at 0, or what could be called the start point of the script. Where there’s only some kind of energy mixing itself and circling around. Later on that energy manifested to the first variable which was the first one. It was a sequence so two and three and etc. appeared. As the numerical variables weren’t enough to make up what is current events, letters were introduced. When there were enough numbers to be assigned to letters, the script was about to be developed enough so that big bang would occur. The distribution of numerical and alphabetical data in 3rd dimension which could go from 0th dimension to 3rd dimension, beginning till end was an option. I must notice that in this informational sequence there’s a law which is one of the basic principles of exponential growth of infinity. The exponential growth itself happens by adding one variable to the script. For instance, there was a 0th dimension in which there was just the movement and mixing of the variables and energies. Well, there weren’t any variables or energies at that point per say. There was just an idea of it, just the potential. It manifested into the first variable to be the first number which was one. As there was a construct of one variable, consequent variables could be filled in, so the progression 0 to infinity began. In numerical order it would be zero, one, two, three, four etc. It was enough to make 0th, 1st and second dimensions. 0th being that eternal mix up of energy. 1st being the first dot, the first pixel which could progress into one direction, left or right. 2nd being the first lines, the first progression of numbers, making up lines sideways, upwards or downwards. It wasn’t enough to make up 3rd dimension. So it had to get depth, progression going in-depth started to commence. The distribution of these three dimensional lines made up bigger entities, bodies which made up different variables. As the growth was occurring, the script got filled with different kind of three-dimensional variables. Important thing to notice is that when one dimensional variable is created and added to the 0th dimension, it’s a leap from 0th to 1st dimension. Rule for exponential growth is that the script from 0th dimension to 1st dimension must be executed before creating/adding another variable. For instance, if you’ve got a 0 in which there’s infinite potential of energy, you can create and assign one dot, which will be equal to 1. Then, you must execute the script which is 0 to 1. Executing the script is important to see if it is executable, if the potential is possible. As the script from 0 to 1 works fine but there’s leftovers of energy and potential, the growth occurs. The sequence starts being filled in. This time, the script runs through 0 to 1 and second time 0 to 1 to 2. To get to the value of 2 the script has to be ran two times consecutively. Once again it is so that any errors could be noted and fixed. So now as we want to get to the first two dots, which are connected, script of 0 to 1 and 0 to 1 to 2 must be executed. If we want to get the 3rd integer, we must run the script 3 times, making our line out of 3 dots. Script now being 0 to 1, 0 to 1 to 2, 0 to 1 to 2 to 3. That is exponential growth of the 2nd dimension. 

Notes: As I realize that, I know there’s a long road ahead to get the next variable, the cycle will end at that variable and script with new variables will be executed, just so one more could be included. As the growth of the script occurs at some point a split is introduced making it not one path but at first one, splitting into two from some point. These paths are executed at the same time which could be the explanation of exponential growth of multiple universes and would be integrated into definition of infinity.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,698619,public,confidence,self,A.

Can't quite remember). After taking, I don't remember much honestly. The first thing that happened was just a very sleepy, kinda scary feeling. ""Shit I took this and it doesn't even feel good what the hell"". And I kinda regretted taking it. But soon I started seeing this odd thing at the side of my vision (kinda looked like Tetris?). And I'm kinda mesmerized. Just watching this game play out in front of me when one of my buds starts saying something about it feeling good or something and I realize that for the past few minutes this warm, buzzing, yellow light has been creeping up my legs. As soon as I realize it it rushes up to my brain and the happiness is so intense. I swear to God I thought I was going to die. I thought I had reached a feeling that mortals aren't meant to experience and that I was gonna be killed or something. It wasn't too scary though. Just. Bliss. Kinda like an orgasm all over my body. A ringing, twitchy, warm feeling from inside me, that felt like it pushed on my skin trying to get out. (Kinda thought it was trying to share itself or some shit?) And at this point I'm feeling pretty good damn good. Happier then I've ever been. Just pleasure. Feels better then any sex I've ever had. My thoughts start to kinda speed up. I assume I was in this weird fast paced state for like an hour but it's hard to tell tbh. All I remember from then is a lot of fragmented memories (real and fake ones I made up I guess?) Flooded my brain. The other thing was a shit ton of sexual imagery but idk why. I didn't know that ecstasy did that. Anyway. I fall asleep after what feels both like 5 minutes and forever at the same time. And I just have this dream that keeps switching from weird thoughts, me doing math, me realizing that this is the best thing I've ever done, and sex. Best dream I've ever had. Wake up and things are normal pace again. Still see the weird Tetris stuff at the side of my vision. But now the sensation is even more pleasurable I think. It's less intense but now that I'm more sober I can appreciate it more. A low orange glow fills my hands and stomach and legs and head. Calming. A feel of calm is over me. This was yesterday. I'm still on this very weird high after sleeping. But the reason I'm eating this is. I'm afraid of becoming addicted. Just such a fantastic feeling can't be replicated but, is it good for me to replicated? I don't want to become addicted. I want to be healthy. But I could get more right now if I wanted and I'm kinda... Tempted. before this I had only had mushrooms which were no where near as blissful as this so I'm a bit confused if this is normal or if... Wait no I'm still just confused. It's a fuck ton to process

TL,DR: tried ecstasy for the first time, felt really good, but now afraid I'll get addicted. How can I prevent this?

After determining that he was just buggin, I told him that I had a tiny bit of xanax. It wont make the trip go away but it will help him relax and make it better. Handed him the pill and he swallowed it. Then I asked him to do some breathing exercises with me for a couple minutes. 

Said I'd check in on them periodically and went upstairs. Went back down in 15 mins and he was just rolling on the floor giggling. Checked in periodically til they all fell asleep. No more problems. 

That pill was just vitamin b12. I didn't actually have xanax. But damned if the placebo effect didnt calm his ass down quicker than xanax actually takes to kick in.

In order for this to make sense to you all first I need to say that I live in a desert, more pr precisely a town located in a desert in Mexico.

In summer the regular tempeture during the day is 113° F / 45° C., so you can get an idea of what it is to be in my shoes. Unfortunately, in winter the lowest we can get is around 59° F / 15° C.

Unfortunately again, I am forced to work with my dad during the day giving manteinance service outside of buildings... on the top of the roof exposed to such high tempetures. Due to this, I can't hide myself directly from the sunlight because there are no shades to do so. I'm alraady used to be heavily warm and my skin is very, very dark now. And I used to be white! For real though, part of my legs, chest and back are still good and white as my natural color, but out of it my face, arms, neck and legs are in a whole different color.

The days are so hot that I don't need a stove to cook my eggs for breakfast since I can just place the eggs on a pan from the kitchen 

That being said, due to this situation is that I found myself trapped inside of places that are refrigerated. My room is completely refrigerated all the time because if not it turns in a oven. 

I'm addicted to cold tempetures. I just love the way it feels to not be sweating like crazy as I usually do but I don't know how harmful this can be if I don't let it to control me. 

How can I get rid of this addiction? I need to enjoy being exposed to such tempetures since I need it for work. My boss tells me that if I don't get used to it I will get fired, and I can't get fired because there are no other job offer that I could get as of now. 

The heartbreaking part is that I work from Monday to Saturday and from 7 A.M to 7 P. M while being directly exposed to the sunlight 90% of the time every day. The roughest time for me starts at the middle of each day when it's 1 P.M and it doesn't get any better until 5 P. M once the sun stops burning me.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,698552,public,confidence,self,I'm addicted to cold tempetures.

I swallowed 80 mg of ritalin and snorted 120mg 15 minutes ago so this might be a long post.Please forgive the inevitable spelling errors. A might be misinformed on some of the following so bear with me and please correct me on any incorrect statements I may make. From what i've heard/seen many downers provide a level of euphoria that's unimaginable unless you've experinced it and extremely powerful. I've also seen/heard that they can ruin your lives in a heartbeat and you can overdose with ease. To the best of my understanding most downers purchased on the street could at any time contain a deadly dose of fentanyl. My friend has a full test kit set and he lets me use it whenever I buy something I want to test (anything but weed or dxm). Out of all the stuff I've tested I was sold one X pill that was a meth bomb. Besides that never tested something and found its not what I bought. I'm assumming that with expensive downers there a lot more fakes and unlike with other drugs these fakes are much more likely to end up with a visit to the Hospital or the Morgue. 

So my question is should these drugs be avoided? I feel like I have somewhat addictive personality but not outa control. A year ago i found an old planner that I didn't use from middle school (I'm 18 rn forgot to mention). I worry a lot about getting addicted to something a lot so I made a ""drug planner"". I've got a list of rules for each new drug I do. Example: Must wait 2 weeks between doses of X drug Minimum. Don't Exceed Y dose and a max of 1 redose or something like that. Another example: today I did my max ritalin dose of 200mg. I write down when I use each drug so I never mess up and delegitimize the whole planner. It sounds kind of stupid but I've never had any problems or broken any ""rules"" so It seems to be effective. The only drug I have no rules for is weed and my use has never been a problem. Unrelated but I'm like really proud of myself for doing this shit because I got pretty strong ADHD and I'm so shitty at planning, organizing, making rules for myself and following through. I've never applied myself so well to anything else. Wish I had successfully used this strategy when I was still in school. Going back now that I've wandered way of topic. What are your opinions? Those that have used opiates/painkillers and other relevant downers recreationally do you regret it? Were you able control your usage or where they just to good? How do you compare the addiction potential of these drugs to others? Don't want to fuck up my life or die but I also enjoy using drugs. Don't want to end up over my head. Other advice/thoughts are welcomed even if I didn't explicatily ask.

None of my friends are interested, but they said they don’t mind if I take it while I’m with them.

I guess my questions are:

1) Does it ruin the experience for me if I’m the only one taking it? 

2) Does it ruin THEIR experience? Like am I likely to become really obnoxious? I’ve never taken it or seen anybody on it so I’m not sure how annoying I’d be.

3) What’s the best setting? Aside from raves and festivals - should I be in a club? Is it okay to take on a more chilled out night? Like if we’re just having a few drinks or at a cocktail bar?

I live with my nan and she came into check on me curled into a ball, shaking, unable to respond coherently. I cried for help. My Nan instantly dialled emergency services and told them what I'd done as she’s very understanding with my drug use, they said they'd never heard of anyone using the combination before, meaning they had to research before they could even act.
Was picked up by the ambulance and put on a drip with my bloods taken. The only real information the docs could give me is that the combo causes seizures.

The cravings don't stop... They even get worse if I'm moving around such as walking or running, and some activities that I do as well such as cleaning up my room, working or doing anything that it takes my energy to perform.

Of course I didn't sleep so coming down off the two drugs was by far one of the worst feelings of my life with the cognitive fatigue, It might be the acid and coke combo causing anxiety and delusion but I've done enough lines of coke that night that I thought I might have a stroke and die. As a so called 'harm reduction' practice I took at least a gram of aspirin to address my concern, at one point last night I was flying so high off that combo that I was almost going to boof the rest of my coke bag for lil b the based god and even send him a video putting the rest of my coke in a capsule and shoving it up my ass. Thankfully I didn't (at least not yet) because I'd either be dead or regret everything and possibly feel regretful for the rest of my life, may my soul have mercy if I ever touch cocaine again as I can't imagine myself touching it for awhile due to the unpredictable nature of the high.

Anyways I'm wondering how safe if it even is safe to take coffee and nicotine to get through comedown and sleep deprivation as I'm worried the amount of cocaine I took might have caused irreversible cardiovascular and circulatory damage as it can be unpredictable compared to most stimulants, I recently woke up from a short 2-3 hour nap and I ate a decent meal with some nutritional yeast, omega 3's from fish oil and 2 grams of l-theanine total with occasional drags off my vape but no coffee yet. I have no known heart conditions and even played sports briefly in high school and only ever suffered a stroke once after being born premature and somehow not being permanently crippled or dead, I'm not very proud of myself right now and I'm lowkey crying because of the shame and physiological strain this experience put me in as this is the worst comedown I've had so far being worse than smoking meth my first time, but some feedback would be very much appreciated.

So I do heroin once every 1yr or so.

Its expensive but I enjoy it. Once I run out of the 1g-2g I purchased, I am always happy to depart with it until the next year or so.

The last time I had it was over 2 years ago. I felt like it was due time I ordered some for myself.

So I ordered myself some, and when it showed up I do what I normally do. I weigh up about 10mg-12mg on my .000 scale and with a razorblade cut it up into 4 equally sized dots. I snort one and wait and see how it affects me.

Normally, it isn’t really active until 10mg but this stuff was really strong at 3-4mg. Heavy body load but not much euphoria. Red flag that it is some synthetic opioid, and not true diamorphine hcl.

Nonetheless I have my girlfriend with me who is sober, and a couple of nasal spray naloxone kits nearby. So I continue to experiment over the course of the next 4 hours. Going to baseline and doing a little more.

Well, I must have hit a hotspot.(a spot in the mass of the drug/filler cocktail that has a higher concentration of the dangerously powerful opioids) because I went from alert to slowly closing my eyes and falling asleep while falling backwards onto my bed. 

Me and my gf were remaining tactile the whole time, holding hands and talking while we messed around on our phones. So she noticed my rapid loss of consciousness in real-time.

She tried to wake me but failed, and got out the naloxone kit. She sprayed it in my nose and since she and I had never seen anything like this before, She was a little scared and called an ambulance.I woke up before they got there and I had a quick chat with them before they recommended I come with them to keep an eye on my vitals.

I went with them and remained totally alert the whole time, they never gave me anymore naloxone or anything else. 2.5hrs later they told me it was okay that I went home, so I walked home from the hospital and thanked my girlfriend for making all the right decisions and apologized to her about the situation.

She was mostly just relieved that I wasn’t upset with her for calling for an ambulance for some reason. Shes one of a kind aha. Like YOU saved MY life girl. 

But after that me and the gf made some penne at 7am and I went to bed because I had to work at 3:30pm that day. 

The day after around noon I got a knock on my door from one of the officers that had responded, and a psychologist that works with the local police department. They came around to ask how I was doing and to offer free addiction counselling, of course I said no because I am not addicted to any drugs. But took her card, and she gave me 3 naloxone kits.

They were really nice people, they definitely didn’t totally believe that I only do it once every year or so. But even if they gave me the benefit of the doubt they also didn’t understand that I just decided to order some out of the blue, were wondering if it had to do with stress from covid.

I told them I don’t drink very often either. A really pained and confused face took over the officers face. But I honestly don’t think of it any different than going out for a bottle or whiskey at any given time of the year. I didn’t know how else to explain it to him without trying to pretend I bought it to escape some reality in my life.

Anyways, thats the story of my first OD. I’ve since decided to volumetrically dose the stuff and no hotspots since then.

I have approximately 1gr of crystals. 

I have a couple of questions since it's something I have never done.

I am on opioids. I am addicted so can't skip taking them or I get withdrawal so I will be on opioids whilst trying MDMA. Not taking them together with the MDMA but I always have opioids in my blood. 

Opioids I take include dihydrocodeine, morphine and oxycodone ( not all together lol). Nothing serotonergic. 

Is the comedown really that bad? I am already prone to feeling super tired daily so will I feel that bad? Would the opioids do anything to mitigate the comedown?

Is there any preparation I need to do before taking it? Like making sure I don't feel in a bad mood, too tired and so on. I have held back so far because I have been feeling exhausted every day and figure this would spoil the fun.

And when you get too hot for comfort, spray yourself with some water and sit in front of the fan. It is super refreshing and lowers your temperature a ton. 
Also, prepare multiple bottles of ice water beforehand. Helps cool you down and prevents dehydration. 


And some info about heatstroke:
At heatstroke is when your body temperature goes over 104F. Heatstroke can cause organ failure and sometimes death. If you experience vomiting, headache, dizziness, weakness, cramps, or feint, you might have heatstroke. At this point, ice water can cause cramps if you drink it, so drink room temp or cool water. Water ideally, not sugar or caffeine. You can strip down, splash/spray cold water all over yourself, and just lay in front of a fan. If you have ice packs, place them under your armpits.  Call for an ambulance if have confusion, fainting, stumbling, or hallucinations that aren’t caused by your drug. Even if you recover on your own, you will need a doctor to assess for organ damage. All this information applies to heatstroke whether you are on drugs or not.

He passed out, slammed his head on the floor, and it fell on me and one other to carry him home. This was the last time i saw him for a while. 

This is where my concern comes into play.  Prior to seeing him last week, my cousin had told me that his xanax problem has gotten worse and hes fucked up every time they hang out. 

Last week, I was invited to hang out with them, at another one of our friends house, and Jack was there. I could instantly tell he was fucked up off more than the drink he was sipping on. When I went to shake his hand, it took about 10 seconds for him to realize I was standing infront him, looking to greet him. His friends near him looked around like they were embarrassed but mildly concerned for their friend. 

Having thought about it, I mentioned to my cousin and friends that they should think about getting him some help cause he clearly has a problem. They said that they “feel bad for him but he’s a grown man so what can we even do”. 

I want to help him, he’s someone I’ve known for years and is a good person, but I dont know him well enough to have this talk with him.

I started this process about 5 years ago, when I switched from heroin to buprenorphine (Suboxone). Then I went from smoking cigarettes to vaping to nicotine gum. Finally, I went from smoking weed to vaping to sublingual/oral homemade MCT oil.

I feel so much healthier. We are often taught that addiction is inherently unmanageable and it certainly is for some people. The sad reality is that many people waste their lives trying to moderate their drug use when abstinence is a much better solution. 

For the minority of us who can sacrifice the initial rush and intensity of drugs for health— a la quitting IV and smoking—modern society has presented us with viable solutions to maintain sustainability. These solutions are modern miracles. That said, nicotine gum doesn’t have the same social warmth as smoking cigarettes. Buprenorphine doesn’t rush like IV or even smoked heroin does (hell it doesn’t even create a high for maintenance users, just zero cravings and heightened mood). Cannabis oil doesn’t come on or hit like smoking weed does (tho wait a couple hours and shit’s even more intense).

Anyways, I was starting to feel my oil creep on and my mood brighten and this is by no means a complete philosophy. I just wanted to share a particular trend in my drug use. I have been addicted to substances since the age of 13. But as I am now staring down my 30s, I must evolve

I haven’t eaten a meal in like 5. I’m not living any resemblance of an actual life, or even fronting a healthy lifestyle.
My family wants me to get clean, and I want to make changes as well, but I know that I will continue to relapse until I work on the things underneath. I also have no real motivation or hope for a future, so the drugs at least keep me here one more day.
I’ve been trying to come to terms with some shit and figure out if maybe it’ll bring forth some spark, or like anything that’ll show me.

I want to see if I can find some new angles and plays when I'm not thinking black/white, but when I'm a bit more creative and open-minded.

Why I'm doing it: So I've been running out of ideas lately and I'm bored with the usual day trading. The markets have become highly irrational anyway, so I figured it might not make a huge difference.

Goal: The goal isn't to gamble or lose any money, however if it happens, then it's £10k I can afford to lose. The goal is to try and grow the capital and to invest it across a few different products or asset classes. It's only £10k, so won't make or break the bank. Will focus on %age gains/losses.

What: I'll smoke a sativa strain, enough so I'm high and thinking creatively, and able to update and talk back to this sub/thread. I'll do this some time next week depending on market events. I trade can trade Asia, UK Europe and US hours, but it's likely I'll stick to UK, Europe and US. Maximum risk will be £10k.

Any tips, suggestions, of recommendations welcome. The process might take a few days, and positions will be held for 1wk min, and 1mo max, before moving out/into new names.

I've tried it twice in my life, once with a friend during college and once with a coworker. The time with the friend I just started coughing and we laughed it off. The time with the coworker I barely felt it, apparently he claims I *was* talking differently, my eyes were red, and I was going a off a bit too much on how much I didn't feel it. But I really don't think I smoked enough to know what it feels like. 

The thing is, with cannabis now legal in my state I've had an innumerable amount of opportunities to smoke, but never really bothered to go out and buy some or look into it. Most of it is because I've had lots of experience in the past with drugs and a few very, very bad ones close to graduation (experimented with xanax and drinking). Literally I called my dad to admit to him that I think I was abusing benzos and alcohol, and rather than the empathetic response I expected he blew up on me. Apparently this had been the *second* time I called and admitted exactly the same thing, but I was on benzos at the time and had no recollection of doing so. I tried to pretend like I vaguely remember and just forgot for a sec, but we both knew I had a problem. 

I once exchange some of my benzos for my friend's adderall and that changed my life in strictly positive ways. I've since been prescribed adderall and consider it a significant positive in my life, I now feel if I make a plan and set out to accomplish a given task I can actually do it without getting distracted and browsing youtube for two hours. So now I just take adderall in the mornings and drink at night.

Sorry for that being long-winded, the point is I have a tendency to get psychologically addicted to things and already have enough vices, so I've been politely declining any offers weed. The thing is, I'm a bit of a stick in the mud and though I try to be fun and sociable I struggle in that area. Everyone who I've ever met who smokes is very sociable, very likable, and very kind. I doubt they're high all the time, it's just who they are. Makes me wonder if I could be a bit more likeable if I tried it on occasion. But I don't want to get hooked and become a stoner, that would suck. Xanax led to some crazy shit and very intense moments conversations with my father, but I could actually work under the influence of xanax, and adderall is just amazing for work. Do you think I could get addicted to weed, like start craving the time when I could get off work and smoke instead kinda like I do with alcohol right now?

I'm still experiencing some effects, but nothing major, just basic visual glitches. There's one effect that I'm curious about though. You see, sometimes I get random images ""pasted"" onto my visual field. Thankfully this ONLY happens when I'm trying to fall asleep after either smoking a lot of weed, or taking anything GABA-based (alcohol, phenibut, xanax, and lyrica, with the latter being the trippiest). Weed RESIN will trigger this much easier than weed itself.

These aren't hallucinations, like people or objects that seem to be there but aren't. These are images that seem to start out in my mind's eye but then get shot forward onto my actual visual field. Usually it's faces/busts of random people but it can be random objects as well. If I open my eyes and look at the wall, I can still see the afterimage of it for a few seconds, the same way you get stuck with an afterimage after looking directly at a light source. Almost as if I had been staring at a neon painting for several seconds, but it came straight from my mind instead.

The way the images come is different. For all of these, the closer I am to falling asleep the higher the chance of an image popping up. There are three methods I've experienced:

1) **From my mind's eye:** I'm drifting off into sleep, thinking about random stuff, and then a particular image will progressively get more and more of my attention until it ""pops out"". This method is slow and smooth, maybe a 2-5 second process. The images usually fade away, but sometimes it's spooky and I have to open my eyes, at which point it becomes a harmless afterimage blob.

2) **From my subconscious:** I'm drifting off into sleep then I feel a mini panic attack caused by the feeling of a subconscious thought piercing through my consciousness. Unlike the previous method, in this method it all happens in a flash. Naturally my heart pounds for a minute or two afterward as I recover from the shock before I can try to sleep again. These images are much more vivid and detailed than the first method.

3) **From my eyelids:** I'm drifting off into sleep, focusing on the dark cloud space I see when I close my eyes, when I start noticing an image form from the ""clouds"". I can feel that an image is about to form right before it does. I've recently figured out that I can divert the image by thinking of something else before it finishes forming. I usually just think ""girl"" and a random girl with random clothing will pop up. There's a chance my will is imaginary here and the image was going to be a girl anyway, but at least it feels like it's not.

As for the nature of the images, they're always very random. The people aren't people I know, and their attire usually has nothing to do with, well, anything. A boy in old-timey school attire with a briefcase, or a blonde woman in blue one-piece swimwear. The only time I recognized it was when I saw an Asian doctor with a face mask and blue scrubs, which I later realized looked just like my old dentist, but even in that case they differed enough in facial features for me to question it a little. The faces are particularly detailed. The objects vary from a truck bed, to a gaming computer case (it was kinda flamboyant shaped so I assume gaming), to a pencil holder with pencils in it. Really random.

There was this ONE single instance where the image wasn't static and actually had motion. I saw a ton of roaches with their antennas flapping around. I can kinda understand this one because we had a bad roach infestation not long ago. It even came with the same feeling of disgust of looking at real roaches, but worse because I don't think I had seen that many roaches together in real life before. It was a lot of roaches. What I didn't understand is why they were sitting on top of my Xbox's power box, since I've never even spotted a real roach around that particular object.

Does anyone else have this? Can I train myself to do anything cool with it or nah? Should I be worried at all that this is happening?

I was wondering what your go to drugs are for socialising? I’m a fairly shy person and am going to a small party tonight. It’s not that I don’t like talking to people, I just struggle with what to say. 

Alcohol is pretty hit or miss with me to be honest, usually makes me quite aggressive and not particularly more sociable. That may be because I’ve always drank spirits, so I may try beer instead. 

I have a small amount of speed that I first tried a few days ago for a long work shift, but I’m not sure whether that would be good for socialising at a party. 

I’ll rule out MDMA because of gurning, might go with coke maybe. 

I know that needing a drug to socialise is not good!

I will never miss the day long headaches turning into serious migraines if I was unable to find any painkillers. I will never miss coming up with outrageous lies to my family for money so I could get pills and not feel sick as a dog. 

I will always be thankful I turned down heroin the few times it was offered to me when I was at my sickest. I will always be thankful I made it out of the opiate addiction alive with no long term damage. 

I started using painkillers to help with my life long migraine issues. They helped greatly everytime but after a while I would use them to get high even if I wasn't suffering a migraine. 

It took me 4 years, many destroyed friendships and a failed relationship to realize what I was doing to myself and others and realize I had to change my ways. 

The cravings have completely gone away, to the point where I get sick to my stomach even thinking about painkillers which I am so thankful for.

Hello i have a little question regarding redosing vyvanse, tldr at the bottom.

Had a little bender with some friends on wednesday, in total i took 200mg over the span of wednesday-thursday morning. After this i managed to get myself around 3-4 hours of sleep during the day on thursday.
After this i found it hard to fall asleep that night and stayed up until 6am on friday (didnt redose, but my sleep schedule is kinda fucked and me sleeping during the day made me not able to sleep that night)

On friday i slept from 6am until 3pm and went to my friends birthday party where me and a friend decided to take 50mg each around 10pm, seeing as i have probably built up a tolerance by then i didnt really experience any euphoria, i just felt a bit tired weirdly enough and when it peaked i just felt more awake and focused. 

When i got home i tried to sleep until around 4am where i got tired of laying in bed wide awake with my eyes closed without anything happening, so i figured that i could try replicating the weird feeling of being tired after dosing by taking another 50mg around 4:30am. (Not the brightest idea ive had obviously aha) 
This didnt work out as planned and i gave up on sleeping tonight as soon as i felt myself getting even more awake. 

Its currently 10pm om saturday and i have a few plans with some friends later today and i was wondering what would be the best way of getting through the day without getting extremely tired once the vyvanse i took at 4:30am wears off

Ive read somewhere that redosing vyvanse only makes the duration longer and that it could maybe lead to the side effects (mostly negative i suppose) being more noticable without any real positive effects lasting longer. 

Would taking another 50mg around 12pm get me through the day in a somewhat functioning state while still making it possible to fall asleep around midnight?
I dont really wanna end up having another sleepless night

Thanks for any helpful advice in advance

This was so weird.

Context

I tried salvia 10x for the first time about a month and a half ago. It was great. Nothing too significant happened, just some slight CEV. Afterward, though, I felt incredibly refreshed, like I had just cried for the past three hours and the heavy stress cloud hanging overhead had dissipated.

Here’s my second experience:

I was sitting at my desk preparing to smoke salvia 10x. Youtube is playing the new Joe Rogan podcast where he and Post Malone are on shrooms. I have a glass of water next to me in case I cough. The incense has been lit. I‘m thinking the experience would be at least a little similar to last time and I will feel nice and refreshed after.

Oh, how I was wrong.

I fill the bowl (a big, deep bowl) 3/4s full and light up.

I take in ALL the smoke, swallow, and hold. I release after about 5 seconds and stare into the corner of my room.

I'm feeling something...

Then I’m standing.

“Come on, let’s go”, Joe says. He’s looking right at me.

“Yea, put it down and keep on going”, says Post, referring to my desk.

“What?” I exclaim, frightened.

“Yeah, just like everyone else”, Joe extends his arm out and points at the *endless* series of people becoming the objects in their rooms and then the cycle continuing on to others, like two mirrors facing each other. The previous people and their rooms were either out of sight or completely forgotten. Oh no.

“Dad!”, I raise my voice, unaware that I’m quickly becoming unhinged (literally).

“No”, says Joe, “let’s go.” I know, very certainly, that I do NOT want to go.

My dad’s voice fills my ears. “Come on, Soph! We’ have to go!” The faint call comes from somewhere down the eternal corridor to my left, adjacent to the initial one where my desk used to be. I know that someone’s waiting for me there.

But no. This HAS to be a joke. Both Joe and Post are staring at me knowingly, smirking.

“No, PLEASE! DAD!” I yelp. I look at the limitless line and feel myself being pulled towards my desk like a magnet. I flail my arms, searching for something solid to grasp. I hear glass fall and cold liquid hit my toes. I’m able to grab the back of my chair and hold tightly. No, no, no. I don’t WANT to go. I scream at myself in my head.

This can’t be real. 

I try to think back to what I was just doing. I can’t remember. I must be on acid, when’s the last time I took acid?? Joe’s been leaving me clues since the last time I took acid, right? He or SOMEONE had to have given me a notion, an idea, ANYTHING that would explain what’s happening right now. This has to make sense, it has to. But I am hopeless. There is nothing that I can say or do to stop myself from complying.

I have it, my whole life, and now I have to put it down. Everything that I am, everything that I know. I can’t lose it or else I’ll become lost. I will NOT go.

And where did my brother go? He should be in the room right next to mine except the wall has been replaced by the endless loop.

“Mark!?” I yell, “DAD, DAD, PLEASE”. I’m screaming.

The loop pulls me in more forcibly. I’m still grasping my chair.

“We need some help with this one”, I hear Joe say.

The director walks onto my computer screen. He’s wearing a red shirt and a dark blue/grey hat. He has a headset on.

“Come on, it’s okay”, he says. “Everyone else has to do it, see?” He points down the corridor.

“Just let go.”

Mark opens my door. “WHAT?” He’s very annoyed.

I turn to him, exasperated.

“Are you going? Are you getting on??” I probe. “Where are they now???”

I don’t let him respond. Instead, I push past him and look around his room for the loop, Joe, or ANYTHING that can explain what just happened. But there’s nothing.

I run back in my room to try and figure it out. The loop is gone but I still feel it pulling me in.

I jump onto my bed and grip the sheets and blankets for life. Please, I just want to go back.

“SOPHIE”, Mark screams. “What the HELL is wrong with you?? And why does it smell so weird?”

I hear my dad yelling at me from down the hall.

I look at Joe and the director and they’re still staring back.

“SOPHIE, come HERE”, my dad shouts. I walk out of my room, shaking slightly.

“Did she smoke weed?” Mark asks.

“NO!”, my dad and I yell in unison.

“Oh, but you managed to spill water everywhere”, Mark says.

By now I know that what just happened was because of the salvia. Nonetheless, I am shocked and rather frantic. Slowly but surely, I returned to normal.

I really feel that I was on the verge of breaking through. I want to try it again sometime soon, but I am still on edge from that small slice of existential terror I was just served.

After 3 weeks I was still super fatigued all the time, granted it was much better than the first few days but after a certain point I plateaued at a certain energy level.

Well I needed to get some more stuff done so I re-upped and today was my first day without them trying to quit again and I am miserable again. I have 0 energy, no motivation, can barely get out of bed and just want to sleep. 

Last time I've tried L-tyrosine, magnesium, and a bunch of suggested supplements all while getting much better sleep (the only benefit I found from quitting) but nothing seemed to work and get me back up to normal energy levels.

3 weeks into quitting I could still almost feel the presence of what was making me so fatigued and it was awful.

I took 2 1/2 while tripping last time and was fine, and have done acid many times now (prob about 20+ times?) so I assumed I would be able to handle 3. I was in a very bad mindset however, my cat got diagnosed with cancer and was dying, and had a lot of anxiety revolved around it before the trip. I was hoping that during this trip, I would be able to work through some emotions more easily. 

We took the tabs at about 3pm. About 20 minutes after taking the tabs I was already very anxious, nauseous, and seeing vivid visuals. A huge jump from the last trip I had which was only half a tab less. The feeling became so overwhelming so quickly that I had to go to the bathroom to try and calm myself down. Even the bathroom was overwhelming, so I went outside to my friend's backyard, and my friends &amp; boyfriend followed.

I sat by the pool and stared at the water. I started saying to my boyfriend that I wanted to go in the pool. He told me I needed to put on my bathing suit. For whatever reason this sent me into a thought loop bc I wanted to go in the pool, but I couldn't process why I needed a swimsuit and it was stressing me out. My anxiety started to get really bad, and the visuals were getting worse. I was shaking and told my boyfriend that I was very stressed. I put my legs in the pool (with jeans on) and didn't notice what was wrong until my boyfriend pointed it out to me. This was when I lost all awareness, and blacked out.

 My friends brought me a bowl of dry cereal to see if maybe a snack would help. Apparently I put the whole bowl in the pool, and cereal floated around the pool. I was still heavily insisting on going to the pool. At some point, I was stressed to the point that I was screaming at the top of my lungs that I wanted to go in the pool. After... I don't even know how long (could be anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours) my friends finally coaxed me out of the pool to go into my friend's shed with them (we made it our hangout spot, its decorated with lights and a tv and couches) 

Until about 1am, I was alternating between screaming and speaking complete gibberish. My boyfriend was freaking out and crying. My friends were comforting him. My friend's mom was feeding me fruit. All of them were taking care of me. I was not there. I was in a my own mental dreamscape of all the thoughts I've had in the past year. It was a series of dreams that (mostly) took place in my environment. But the scenarios that were happening in my head were not in real life. The whole time I took it all as reality without question. It was like a series of trippy, fucked up lucid dreams

The way I experienced it: the first dream was focused on the pool. There was soft, calming music in the background. It almost reminded me of the background music in Adventure Time or Bee and Puppycat. I could hear waves, and my whole field of vision was taken up by the water. The pool was more flat and low level, almost like a kiddie pool or a pond. First I saw my friend's mom in the pool. I noticed she looked happy, she looked free. I wanted to go in the pool, like her. I wanted to feel happy and free. But for some reason, I felt that I couldn't. One by one, I saw my friends appear in the pool. (nobody actually went in the pool that night btw. I sat on the steps fully clothed, but nobody went fully in) They gave off a carefree energy, just grateful to be in the water. More than anything, I wanted to go in with them. But something was holding me back. Even after digging up some of my emotions while writing this, I still don't fully understand it. I kept saying, out loud and in the ""dream"", ""I want to go in the pool"". Then my friend's mom would say, ""Then go in the pool"". And each time I felt compelled not to. But I wanted to. And the thought loop continued.

There was a brief dream after this where I thought I gave birth in the pool. I felt cramps, saw blood in the pool, hell, I even thought my friend's mom said to me, ""So... Don't be alarmed.... But you gave birth."" The embarassing part that in real life I /was/ yelling ""I have a kid? Give him to me!!""

When we were in the shed, I had a series of dreams that took place there. In the first one, I thought one of our friends was dead. It relates back to a dream I actually had a couple weeks before that where he was murdered by a group of women in red (I have weird dreams ok). My friends were trying to figure out who killed him, and I was trying to tell them ""It's the women in red! They killed him in cold blood!"" But everything I said went unheard.

I then had another dream that we were bombed by North Korea. (My boyfriend and I recently had a conversation about the country so thats probably why it came up) My friend's mom came to tell us that we were at war, and needed to leave the area because it was dangerous. My friends were hesitant, but I was urging them that we should just go. I was basically saying, fuck money, fuck all of our worries, the world is in shambles, let's just go and get out of here. Again I went unheard. There were multiple dreams where we were put in a position to run away with multiple scenarios, but I don't quite remember them. There was even one where we actually /did/ take off, and we were in a van that was decorated like the shed.

After that was just a series of wild mini dreams with similar scenarios. Many of them had themes of running away. There were brief moments where I was back in reality, but I wasn't truly aware until about 1am. Apparently I just randomly laid down for 2 minutes, closed my eyes, then woke back up and was back to normal. Around 3am, my boyfriend and I walked home and arrived at about 4.

After this was 24 hours of the worst dissociation I have ever felt. I only slept for about 4 hours, woke up and still felt out of it. I don't even think the acid was truly out of my system until the day after. My pupils were still dilated throughout the morning, and the night. I have never felt so disconnected from reality in my life, and I felt very anxious that I would never ""come back"".

Luckily, I woke up fine the next day, and went to a job interview and got hired on the spot! That definitely helped bring me back to reality. But now throughout the day, if I zone out or dissociate even slightly, I get a huge wave of anxiety that for whatever reason, I'm going to lose awareness again. It's actually been somewhat of a good thing, bc it was somewhat of a wakeup call and I started getting my shit together (went back to therapy, signed up for classes, went back to work).

 I guess I just wanted to share my story to maybe give others the opportunity to share any experience they have had that was similar, or share thoughts and advice. It's an experience that I feel like I'll never forget, and I guess I just hope to find some people to connect with me over this. :)

He first showed me a rock of the stuff. Upon inspection, it is the furthest thing from coke I’ve ever seen as something trying to pass as coke. It had a pale, yellow color and was completely matte. It was a bitch and a half to finally break apart because it had the consistency of an extremely old rubber eraser. Then he showed me some gram baggies that had been left in the car. What was once a powder-like substance had melted together and is now malleable, like semi hardened clay. I didn’t even know how to try it consuming it, as it was impossible to break down to a powder at all, and it didn’t look like it could be smoked or shot. My homie said it tastes like pain killers (he was given a bump when he bought it because it was probably freshly made and still a powder, he said he fell asleep).

Each pill is said to contain extract from 200 mg saffron – 1 mg Safranol and 3.5 mg Crocin.

Saffron definitely has psychoactive properties. I remember the first time I had a dish with a high saffron content, Gambas (giant shrimp?) in saffron sauce. After finishing my meal, I got up, put on some music, and immediately felt it. The MDMA Clarity. If you’re on this sub, you know what I mean. The lights seemed brighter. The music incredibly crisp, every note feeling great. Everything just felt better. It’s not like I was rolling my face off, but the feeling of “MDMAzing” is unmistakable, even in small amounts. Calm. Peace. 

These pills feel the same way. The recommended dose is one with breakfast and one with lunch – so today I had one around lunchtime and one before dinner (I don’t eat much). 

Some background: 

I’ve struggled with depression most of my life so far, with good and bad periods of course. Have been using all sorts of methods to cope – cutting, alcohol, weed, love, drugs etc. some working better than other, some working for a while, some being more reliable than others.

Weed has definitely been a great helper, giving me the self-esteem that enabled me to find love. Love is one hell of a drug, and I have no idea when cuddling withdrawals will stop. First time I tried MDMA was definitely an eye-opener. “WOW! Is it even possible to feel this good?” Really gave me hope for the future- if it’s possible to feel like this, I can make it through all the sadness and misery. 

After a break-up back in ’17 I microdosed LSD for about half a year, with amazing results. Later that year, I started tripping, which got me thrown into all kinds of loops in my mind, ego death etc. Ended up falling deep into depression and start drinking. A lot. Drinking to forget, drinking to sleep. 

Speed has also been quite effective for productivity – I love typing on speed, and even cleaning is pretty great. Also, surprisingly good at removing the “I want to lay down and die” feeling. I sometimes feel Amphetamines get a bad rep for some reason; in Denmark it’s called “cheap man’s coke”, directly translated. Overall great drug. 

These capsules are amazing. The best way I can describe it is microdosing MDMA. The grip of depression feels lighter. Music sounds better. I’m experiencing reality in a higher resolution. I feel lighter. The dark clouds in my mind are just clouds now. I’ve been very social &amp; talkative today, and really enjoyed it. I hate myself and everyone less. look forward to tomorrow. Who am I even? 

After doing some reading, it seems that there’s limited but good science behind the antidepressant effects of saffron, suggesting it is as effective as pharmaceutical antidepressants: 

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC517724/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC517724/)

Looking forward to seeing how this turns out. It’s been about 3 months since I last did MDMA, and I’ve only done 2 Teslas over the past year so my tolerance is pretty much none (if there’s any cross tolerance between MDMA and safranol/crocin). The recommended dose is 2 caps/day, so I’ll keep doing that.  

Most importantly, I feel good right now. Happy. Not euphoric, just calm &amp; at peace. I’ve had a good day. So far, I definitely recommend these Saffron pills. Saffron in general is an amazing flower.

Essentially, I am looking to enter my first psychedelic experience.

As a little bit of background, I have never taken LSD or enough DXM to trip, but I have been researching both. I take 60 mg Cymbalta (duloxetine) daily, but I will have not taken any for 48 hours before I plan to trip (if serotonin sickness seems plausible, I have plenty of benzos on hand). I plan to do this alone and while everyone else in my house is asleep.

My questions are: is it likely that either of these drugs would make me lose control enough to disturb other people in the house? If so, which would pose a lower risk, and at what dosage can I remain undiscovered without sacrificing the experience?

I finally codified the rules I follow when using cocaine. I hope they can  be of use to you. I'm open to criticism of all kinds, praise, whatever  you want. Several of the rules are more like addendums to previous  rules, but oh well. Trying to catch all the possibilities here.

**The Primary Rules of Dangerous Recreational Drug Use**

1. Use limitations. Only so much at once. For cocaine, one line per nostril per night of use. So, two lines.
2. Trend  must never be toward higher frequency of use. It should generally trend  to lower frequency of use. Trend can only flatline when frequency of  use has reached 'recreational' levels. 'Habitual' levels of drug use are  not acceptable.
3. Rule  Number 1 and 2 \*can\* be broken on rare circumstances. This is not a  pass to cheat the system, merely to avoid complete rigidity.
4. Be  honest about the state of Rule Number 1 and 2. Is Rule 3 being used to  circumvent them? If it is, Rule 3 is nullified until balance is again  achieved.

**The Secondary Rules of Dangerous Recreational Drug Use**

1. Never  use the drug of choice to try to negate the negative psychological  effects of the drug of choice. If the drug creates crushing lows after  its incredible highs, that is the price of using specified Drug. Do not  re-use the drug to delay the inevitable drop by achieved successive  highs. This in an infinite pit to hell.
2. With  exceptional care and precision, other Drugs may be used to combat the  negative physical health effects of the Drug of choice, but care must be  taken not to mix drugs that should not be mixed. Also, care must be  taken to not use this drug often enough that you become addicted to it  (benzos to help combat the deleterious effects of cocaine on the heart,  for instance).
3. Only  use Drug of choice when you are already in an elevated emotional state.  Do not use it to bring yourself out of a depression, because you will  only end up in a lower state than when you started. If you were already  low, this is a problem, and may encourage the breaking of Rule 1 of the  Secondary Rules.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,698326,public,confidence,self,"I've made a list of rules for recreational drug use for those that might be struggling, or could use some guidance/help.

So recently one of my closest friends(20) started to smoke marijuana and do LSD. He’s never used/done any sort of drugs in his entire life. But since coronavirus started he’s been at home sitting on his ass all day. I would say he started smoking in the beginning of July maybe 1x every 2-3 days but now he  smoked 3-4x a day. He just got LSD and took his 2nd tab within a 3 day break span. I don’t know what to do in this situation. He doesn’t want to go to college or even exercise and every time me and the boys go over to hangout he’s just hitting his bong. Nothing wrong w smoking, my other friends do it but not on a daily basis. Maybe just at parties or rare social gatherings.
Money isn’t a problem for him since he lives w his mother who is wealthy. I don’t know how to attack this approach  and I just want to help him.

-pick out your max acceptable dose early on. Never surpass this dose for any reason.

-take a day off every once in awhile. Challenge yourself to go a day without.

-tolerance occurs at the receptor, not based on how strong of an effect you got. Alternating drugs that hit different receptors allows tolerance to reset.

-if using a dangerously addictive drug, be addicted to a less harmful drug(weed for me) to fall back on when you’re craving.

Then I went in to work with a nice 600mg afterglow from the previous night. The new drive and found confidence were there.

Within an hour, they were back, they loved the idea, and were onboard if I could get a project together that made sense. This is what I've been doing for the last few weeks.

So, I thought I'd just brag about the confidence a recreational dose of pharmaceuticals provided to me.

The nurse lady took one look at me and say “your baked out of your mind aren’t you.” Lucky I have a great excuse for looking high as fuck. So I say “nah it’s cause I’m a diabetic.” And she buys it. So during the last class of the day I drifted between sleep and laughing with my friends. It had been a good day and on the bus ride home I get to relax.

It made me anxious and uncomfortable w myself, it forced me to confront things and it felt like there was knot in my chest, and when I wanted to speak out my feelings, I simply wasn’t able to.

I couldn’t speak until I tried and put some effort and everything slowly started rolling out. All my traumas and fears, and the best part is I was given a safe space to share with no judgment and it’s something I had never experienced before.

Whenever I would speak something that was making me anxious about my past, this knot in my chest would slowly become less tight, and the more I talked the better it felt, and at one moment it was incredible euphoria but it felt better than usual because I had found it myself I guess :D

The acid was making me see the things from a different way, like it usually does and I tend to learn from that but my fears/anxieties are still within me as I’ve never spoken/thought them out loud, and the mdma forced them to surface, and that was so extremely liberating and freeing!

It was a million times better than mdma happiness because I had to earn it, and it was true and heartfelt :)

I cried today in the shower cause I never knew what it felt like not to be judged and I was just recalling yesterday and the trip.

I knew there was moments I did something awkward/ weird and my mind would think they are judging me for that, which is essentially myself, but they weren’t judging me, and having felt that for the first time ever is incredible

I told her because I just wanted to and that I started when I was maybe 14 or 15. She made me promise not to smoke weed ever again. Yesterday, she found my dab pen that was under my pillow.

Now I almost never use opioids and I don't feel like shooting up the heroin I recently picked up. I fuck up smoking it off of foil too even though I've smoked a shitload if cathinones on foil. 

Anyway I was thinking, if I added ascorbic acid to a line of my heroin and snort it it should technically have an acid-base reaction in the water of my mucus membranes and be able to be properly absorbed right?

Anyone with a bit more knowledge of chemistry/pharmacology can elaborate on if this would work or why if it wouldn't. Or if there are easier ways to make #3 snortable. I mean I did some lines and I do feel it but I'm guessing that's most likely due to the drip and it getting absorbed in the stomach.

Nitrous oxide - doing nitrous is almost a waste if I haven't worked out, it's probably the drug that is most effected by working out. If I have not worked out I get dissociation and some body high, almost no euphoria. But if I do workout the effects get a bit more intense but the euphoria is incredible its much more pronounced and feel more ""clean"" it also seems to last a bit longer, after effects are about the same. 

Kratom - also one of the drugs that is not worth doing without exercising without I get a sort of wierd warm/disappointed feeling but after exercise I get euphoria not super extreme but it can be sort of strong where I just want to lay down and smile. 

Nicotine - about the same feels a little more clear headed and relaxed than it would doing it without exerciseign before. 

Lsd - only done one time exercised before and had an amazing time but have nothing to compare to so take this with a grain of salt. 

Caffeine - no difference removes some of the post workout relaxation / mild euphoria 

Ashwagandha - a commonly used nootropic if I take a high enough dose (about 1600mg extract) after working out I actually get a very relaxed buzz (only if I haven't taken it like 3 days prior) were my skin feels very pleasant and like there is no worries in the world

Everyone treats you so much different and it's almost always rude and annoying. I'd like to preface that I enjoy tripping maybe once a month or two, roll one maybe 8 weeks in between, smoke weed every day, and occasionally like to bump into some k. I love(d) trying to educate people on exploring their consciousness, softening their ego, and using drugs as a way to explore music, art, and yourself.

I went camping last year and brought a strip. I gave like 9 people acid for the first time and they told me it was the most fun they had all year. Didn't charge anyone, just thought it would be fun and nice. The trip was planned again this year, twice as many people, most strangers to me, and they wanted to trip again. None of them have a plug except for me, so guess who was tasked with dosing everyone. This time it's not free.

Thing is, I don't wanna give over a dozen hits to a bunch of strangers, one of my friends is in the middle of a mental break down, I just don't think it'd be responsible to provide these people doses, and some how I feel like when they act irresponsible or get hurt or freak out, everyone's gonna look at me for their dumb actions.

So what I thought would be way more manageable - bringing ecstacy. Now I am not a plug, I'm just the only one with a plug. So I tell them I can't (actually won't) get acid, but I can get rolls. Get a headcount, tell everyone the cost, and buy them. Not cheap, but these things are quality. Right off the bat like 5 people drop out as soon as I just spent mad money on rolls. I just know they're gonna do that ""should I?! I shouldn't... But it looks fun and I want to... But no... Everyone's doing it... Well..."" Just be fucking decisive, you put in an order, I spent money on you because of it, fucking own up to it. Throw the roll In the river, put it up your butt, give it away, I don't fucking care but don't pussy out and not pay me for it. You're not screwing a drug dealer you're screwing your generous friend.

My other friend just got out of the Navy after 7 years. He introduced me to edm shows, gave me MDMA for the first time, and I know him to be a party animal. So he invited me to a party, I asked if he wanted me to bring any special goodies. I was just trying to be nice, not plug his party, but help him enjoy his first party back. He said no, so all I brought was a few beers and my dab pen. 

He basically starts telling people all I do is rave (I do enjoy shows), that I'm his plug. Forces me to talk about raving. Asks me for blow. Tells everyone I'm gonna provide all the drugs so they can trip in a cemetery (wow what an original and fun idea for your first trip) people are coming up to me basically suggesting I'm just going to give them my personal stash. I don't do any of that shit (except go to shows and I'm usually just stoned sipping a beer) I'm not a plug I cant and won't get you blow or drugs, I just wanted to see my old friend who apparently didn't grow the fuck up after 7 years in the Navy. Made me feel like a drug addict when in reality I was probably the most successful person at that party and the only one to grow up after high school. Also not an addict.

So after this camping trip, I'm done talking about it. I'm done trying to be nice about it. I'm not your fucking party prop. I try to be generous and help people have meaningful experiences and it paints me as some druggy loser lab rat plug who feels like they need to be responsible to the idiots who agree to an adult decision like taking drugs. I'm not your shaman or therapist. ""Oh, you're aura is dark purple. You should take 115ug of some needle point and that will fix the hole in your soul."" Fuck you.

You never know what the drugs are going to show you, and you never know how you may react, even if you consider yourself experienced with psychedelics. 

Last night I consumed about 2gs of mushrooms and had a terrifying experience that I’m still a bit shaken from. I’ve probably taken these exact shrooms about 10 times before, no issues. They gave me some beautiful experiences, I thought I knew what I was doing and felt really comfortable on them in my past trips. I tripped on them alone a handful of times and nothing bad happened. I hadn’t tripped in a while up until last night and I had about 2gs left so I thought I’d finish them off cuz I had a free night. 

I should also note that I have struggled with anxiety, intrusive thoughts, &amp; suicidal ideation for most of my life. The past year I’ve really been working on it and it’s improved so much. I’d say that experimenting with mushrooms have helped so much in that process. 

I should have honestly clued in that last night was not a good night for me to trip, I just went through a bit of a messy breakup and yesterday I went on a huge hike and was completely exhausted afterwards. Wasn’t in the best head space, but since I’ve tripped so many times before on these shrooms and have also tripped when I wasn’t in the best head space before and i still had a good time, I thought I would be fine. 

I made some tea, drank it, and so began one of the worst trips I’ve ever had. I got this feeling of intense anxiety and terror, I couldn’t control my thoughts at all (very common of intrusive thoughts). Thoughts of horrible human suffering kept popping into my head, like I was being reminded by the mushrooms of all the suffering that humans have experienced over history, and also all the suffering going on in the world right now. I also felt like the mushrooms were telling me that I should kill myself, and every time I closed my eyes all I could see were knives floating in the air. I was terrified to leave my room because I felt delusional and thought if I was anywhere near a knife I might actually kill myself.  

Also none of the tools I’ve used before to calm me down during a bad trip were helping. I’ve used guided meditations that worked amazing in the past, but had no effect on me last night. It would have been great to have a sober person to talk to during that time, but since I thought I was “so experienced” and “knew what I was doing” I never planned to have one, I was completely alone. 

Who knows, maybe if that was my first time on psychedelics and I had that experience I would have actually committed suicide without a trip sitter there. It is so important to prepare yourself properly and be responsible with these substances. Even for experienced users, you never fucking know what the drug may show you. Always have a trip sitter, and never use these substances when you don’t feel like you’re in the great state of mind. Do your research. Set &amp; setting are everything.

Dear User

If you use drugs as a status symbol, if you categorize people that don't use drugs as ""outsiders"" or that they can't understand you, you are everything wrong about the drug culture. Remember those gross anti-drug ads and horrible stories about drug users? Yes, you are them. You basically remove empathy from the equation. You differentiate yourself from the group you have to convince that you are as healthy and productive as they are. What you do makes it harder for legalisation and freedom.  


The chances are drugs aren't your status symbol. You lack a sense of self/personality and trying to use drugs for your rescue, this story never ended well. You are not only using drugs to mask your problems but also hurting all of us.   


If you brag about the quality of your drugs, the chances are you lack the real stuff to brag about and once again, trying to use drugs for your rescue. Ironically, these people are often the same people that don't test their drugs and are sure of the quality because they were so ""blazed"" that day. (Spoiler alert: It might just be because of your heroic doses of unknown substances)   


To your surprise, dear user... Noone cares about how "" you got the best shit "", I'm sorry, they really don't. Your substitute for an achievement is not even your achievement.   


If you brag about how much you use, You are the worst. I just don't get it, why would anyone brag about their tolerance? This is basically saying "" I used unnecesarry amounts of the drug X knowing that it doesn't effect me that much any longer, and i don't have the guts to give a break, how cool is that?"" This is a very poor attempt trying to normalize your situation by calling others ""weak"". No, it's very often the opposite, you're too weak to note your doses and lack the intelligence to calculate how much you should use.   


The chances are you try make your past abuse look like an achievement, which overall looks weaker than anything i've ever seen.   


If you try to make someone else smoke/use, force them to smoke more or get sad about the fact they don't, I feel really sorry for you. Because no, the reason that you don't enjoy yourself is not the fact that your friend doesn't want to smoke any more, It's because you don't enjoy it yourself, and that person enjoyed themselves enough. You're just trying to find another rush from making them smoke/smoke more.   


Regardless of all the ethical issues behind this, tell me, please, If you feel a need to make someone else smoke for you to enjoy your high, do you really enjoy getting high itself? I don't think so. You should reconsider if you should use these stuff even. You need to figure out why you can't enjoy smoking without forcing other people to smoke, or that if you even enjoy smoking at all.

I am currently 22 and didn’t do much drugs till I was 19 so its only 3 year period. I’m not a big fan  of chemicals it was only one year of that period I used chemicals. I used about 5 times of ketamine and I smoked weed pretty much everyday for last 3 years. Most of the times it was MDMA and I started getting memory problems after some time because of everyweek use. This is a big problem for me because before my depression started about 4 years ago,I had somewhat autistic memory where i categorized every single thing -sometimes I would recall dialouges by their length/tone- by their color,by their length and mass in numerical way,the color it felt to me as a object/person,by their heat and some more labels i can’t remember right now. I have adhd and possibly synesthesia plus i think i have autistic tendencies so its not really a surprise to me. What surprises to me my memory has been getting worse and worse due to my weed and mdma uses before. I’m having hard time to get the information out,my short term memory is awful besides having a severely damaged long term memory as in some parts have been deleted. I can feel I can no longer make complex neurons as I could do before when I was a teen because I was labeling a object with many labels so it was really easy to remember anything at all by details. I think I should add my academic career has ended in beginning of high school -i pretty much lost interest even though I had highest entry score to that school- as I know thats one of the reasons of my cognitive decline. What kind of path I should be following to repair the damage I have done in recent years? I’m on concerta right now and it seems to help and I will be getting ketamine injections next month after they do QEEG and Crainal MR scans,im hoping maybe that would help to determine what is wrong. I really need suggestions if anyone can,thank you!
PS: I used 6 times of LSD in period of 5 months about 2 years ago so I had HPPD till a year ago but its gone now I think.

People just like being right and want to convince as many people to adopt the same drug or behaviour, because if you adopt it, they get approval. Stoners find stoned stories cool, drinkers find drunk stories cool etc. Meanwhile outsiders find this behaviour toxic.

What are the health risks of reasonable amphetamine usage? 


I really like using it for parties - I love dancing and talking with people and it gives me both more energy and makes me way more confident and social. 

I never take more than 80mg of pretty clean amphetamine (not pharma grade though) per night (usually my max is 70mg) and more than 200mg per week (usually my max is 150mg per week).

I follow all harm reduction steps: I always eat a good, balanced meal before going out to a party and after coming home, I have at least 6 hours of sleep after amph usage, I never snort it, I always dose my stuff before so I never take more than intended and I take supplements to prevent potential neurotoxicity, cardiovascular toxicity along with magnesium supplements before taking my dose. 

There are no studies that low or moderate doses of amphetamine are neurotoxic. What are other health risks that I should watch out for?

Tl;Dr at the bottom

I'm German and currently getting into druggardening, but I want to keep it all legal at least until the point of preparation/ingestion. 

I have read the online version of our BtMG (it's the ""Narcotics Law"" for, for all the non-germans who are still interested in this post) and am a bit confused about the legal situation with growing psychedelic mushrooms. The next part is extremely technical, I'm going to try to translate some parts as best as I can for the sake of consistency:

[Annex 1 makes psylocibin and psylocine and their esters and salts illegal.](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/btmg_1981/anlage_i.html)


In addition, the last footnote refers to § 2(1)(1)(b) to (d), which defines the term ""substances"". [The word ""substance"" includes mushrooms and their components, both worked and unworked.](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/btmg_1981/__2.html)

The footnote in appendix 1 says ""substances"" (so also spores of mushrooms) that contain the illegal drugs of appendix one or serve the purpose of reproducing/making them are illegal only if they are made to abuse them for intoxication purposes.

This is in my understanding the paragraph that makes it legal to grow for example mescaline cacti like San Pedro or Peyote, or DMT containing plants as long as you ""don't use them for intoxication purposes"".  When applying this to psylocibin mushrooms, they should also be legal to grow as long as you don't make it obvious that you are planning to consume them. As long as you only posses the mycelium or shrooms that are alive and growing, you could argue that these are not meant for consumption just like you would when having psychoactive, legal plants.

Anyways this is just my understanding of the law, and I am by far no lawyer. I'm sorry for this extremely specific question that probably almost only Germans will have an interest in, I'm still hoping for some further information. Thank you in advance!

Showed up to work yesterday and i immediately noticed 2 new guys in our crew driving a second truck &amp; trailer. After some asking around i found out that the driver (who *i kid you not* looks exactly like Tuco from breaking bad) is a bigtime dealer of almost anything. I dully noted this and went about my work day.

Towards the end of the day i ended up in the truck with Tuco and the other skinny ass dude. Right as we finished up our last house and were on route back to the yard, they lit up a blunt and started smoking. When my fiend ass asked for a hit, they hesitated before passing it to me. I gladly took 4 or 5 long drags and passed it up to Tuco.

It should be noted at this point that i am a chronic weed smoker and have extensive LSD and mushroom experience. But before i even knew what happened, i was obliterated. My visual field was consumed with acid-like hallucinations resembling around a 200ug dose, but they were so much more confusing and nonsensical. The entire interior of the car was spinning and i could barely even tell what anything was. My hands were vibrating and my fingers were incredibly restless, more restless then ever (even with lifelong ADHD and anxiety). And the weirdest thing was i couldn’t understand a fucking word of what the guys in the front seat were saying. Tuco was talking the entire ride back to the yard with the skinny dude mostly just nodding, and i couldn’t fucking make out a word of it for the life of me. It all just came out as incomprehensible nonsense sounds. 

I swear for a minute i thought i was in a video game or something. I started to frantically drink my water and try to eat a granola bar because i thought my body needed nutrients to stop everything from spinning so much. I didn’t panic because i knew the effects were from whatever i had just smoked, but i had no idea how long it was going to last, as it reminded me of acid so much. 

When we got back to the yard (this felt like 30 minutes even though it was less than a 5 minute drive) i tried to ask Tuco what the fuck was in that blunt but i still couldn’t make out anything of what he was saying. I came down a couple minutes later but god, was it intense.

It made me think; because they have had a drastically different upbringing from generations who have used psychedelics before them, will they perceive psychedelic experiences differently?

It seems to me that young people these days are much more open to the idea of taking mind altering substances for fun, but not for medicinal and spiritual purposes. This makes me worry that the best use for things such as DMT, mushrooms and acid will be discarded and they will instead be used purely as a party drug or for fun.  


It also seems to me that no matter what, these experiences are so strong and meaningful that no matter who uses them, they can gain some knowledge or understanding about themselves and the universe they exist in.

Four months following I had my first experience with dpdr, I couldn’t smoke weed anymore without having a chance of dread, and amphetamines later gave me the same reaction. I feel very unhappy that the choice to use was taken from me all together and that I had to go through insane withdrawal when coming off my prescription. I want to be like I was before, durable. What can I do to fix this, I have abstained mostly from all substances except kratom and alcohol for the last 16-17 months. Still dealing with episodes of dpdr and anxiety, I always had anxiety growing up but nothing like this. 

I’m only 21 and I am much smarter and more responsible I feel sad that my time to really enjoy experimenting has been taken away by the actions of my recent past. Anyone have luck undoing this headspace and issue, my theory is that those bad trips reduced my serotonin transporters by causing a ptsd like reaction because I am generally more anxious and dysphoric, and I’ve been rewired to freeze before fight/flight, additionally that an integration psychedelic therapist with a gram of mushrooms will fix this. Those bad trips had a purpose and I am grateful for the lesson because I grew up and some of that stuff has always been underlying, but the lesson should’ve ended sometime ago as I am a different man and this feeling is subconscious not conscious, any feedback appreciated.

Honestly, it’s been great for me. Works fairly well and don’t have any real problems with it. I think the only issue it may be causing is short-term memory loss and/or constant forgetfulness.

It’s currently 5:30 in the morning and I cannot sleep because I have no self-discipline when it comes to taking Adderall. I’m so hung up on not wanting to deal with the comedown that I will pop another pill no matter how late it is just to avoid it and sacrifice my sleep. At around 3:00 AM, all of the Adderall in my system wore off and I was tired enough to finally catch some Z’s. I popped about 15mg of melatonin and after about five minutes, because of how impatient I am, I decided to get back up and use my laptop while I waited for it to kick in. After another five minutes of being on my laptop, I forgot why I got back up in the first place and thought that since I am up for whatever reason it was and can’t sleep, I might as well pull an all-nighter. So I popped another Adderall and it never really kicked in and I remained tired.

After facing the disappointment and deciding to hop back in bed, it hit me—I just realized that the Adderall didn’t work because my dumbass popped 15mg of melatonin 5 minutes prior to taking it. As a result, both of the meds negated each other’s effects, so now I wasted not only both of them, but also sacrificed the majority of the night and my sleep for nothing.

Now here I am, laying in bed on my phone because I’m too tired to think or function but not tired enough to want to sleep.

I haven't been a user for a while, and definitely not a benzo fiend. 

However I'm having a brain MRI that will take half an hour and the GP (not my usual one, he's gone away) prescribed me 15mg of diazepam, that's 3 tablets, because I suffer from claustrophobia.

The only times I take bentos is when I fly long distance (from Australia) I need over 20mg just to relax a little bit. I'm tall. 

I'm so frustrated because now I'm trying to find a way to potentiate or synergise...I don't care if I'm floppy once I'm there. I've googled til the cows come home

In the past I've tried grapefruit juice and promethazine and while they probably help a bit, it could be placebo. 

Anything else you can suggest? Preferably over the counter (or better, something around the house?

I had a good trip, I was happy, and things were great. But the after affects were immediately noticeable, since then I’ve been told I seem as if I’m a different person. I’m quick to anger, quick to emotion, and quick to pain. 

My depression post trip became much worse, and I have a friend who I already had issues with (mostly on my end) and I drove them to a point where they purposefully hurt me because they wanted to get rid of me. 

My friends treat me differently and look at me differently, and I’m left asking myself what the fuck happened. At first I didn’t want to blame the shrooms, and I could be way off, but the fact that this all started after I was off of them has to be worth at least a theory (despite the fact that I’m framing it as if I know for sure). 

The past few months I have genuinely been a bad person. And I’m not allowing myself to take all the blame possible. But it feels like everybody around me changed progressively over the past months including myself. I don’t really know how to describe it. 

The day before I took them I was optimistic, learning that mushrooms have promising uses in psychiatry for the use of helping treat depression, and for me it did the exact opposite.

I don't even drink. I've smoked weed a dozen times in my life, but I never developed a taste or habit for it since it mostly magnifies my anxiety. I would smoke once in a blue moon if I was in the right mindset with friends because I had some bad trips with it in the past. I've never done hard drugs, nor will I ever. 

My friend smokes weed everyday. The other night, he baked two types of brownies. One batch had a special ingredient, the other batch didn't. I chose to eat the normal batch of brownies since I haven't really had good experiences with edibles. Plus, at my age (28M), I want to stay away from weed period since I am about to graduate from graduate school and I want to move onto a better job. Nevertheless, I made sure that I ate the right batch that had no THC in it. Well...

After eating some brownie with ice cream, I started to feel...different. I told my friends, ""There's something happening to me."" I was convinced that I got a mild high from eating this batch of brownie.  We all thought it was hilarious of course. Luckily it was a good mild high and not a scary one. My friend told me that he washed the brownie mix bowl after cookie the THC brownies. I don't know how else I could have gotten high from the ""normal"" batch of brownies. I don't think that he used the same THC oil for the normal mix.  I also don't think I could have gotten a contact high even though the smell from the THC brownies was incredibly strong during the baking. When I went home, I took an at home marijuana test and tested positive for THC. Is there any part of the baking process that could have cross contaminated the THC brownies with the normal brownies that I ate?

I am not really asking about the safety of drugs themselves, I understand that risk and see through the bullshit when people say something is harmless because it is natural or vise versa because it's inherently a drug. All mushrooms are natural but theres a bunch you can really only eat once... In summary, I'm really asking if the experiences, and social aspects are worth those risks medically or of addictions.

Just wanted to reach out and see if anyone had any reasoning or similar experiences.

I first took mdma probably 6 years ago now, for the first 2 years or so I took it maybe once every 5-6 months at large events and my laaaawd it was magical, such a great time with friends. A small group of my friends and I got pretty deep in the local dnb scene after that and we were going out atleast once a fortnight and often every weekend for a month and we were dropping every time. While I know it was excessive I never noticed any negatives to my health or the effects of the drug (the super intense euphoria was gone after the first couple times, but we still enjoyed the effects). After I finished uni it returned to taking it maybe 2/3 times a year, sometimes going longer than a year without taking it. 

Fastforward to today and I don't take any at all anymore, haven't bothered trying in almost a year. When I would go out and take it with friends, the same people that had been doing it with me since the start - they were still taking maybe 2 a night, 4 max (100mg caps) and still having intense rolls and long lasting effects. Meanwhile I noticed that it often had literally no effect on me, its almost like my body just stopped being able to feel it at all. Because of my desire to be able to roll with my friends and have the good times we used to, I kept trying at events every so often. Still nothing, the last time I dropped I took 8 in a night, atleast a gram, and felt nothing, cold turkey sober. No body high or raised temps and heartbeat and nothing mentally. I know these werent duds because the people I was with were having intense rolls off 1 cap. I know by this point there was no reason to keep trying or ever do it again really, I know that regardless of whether I feel its effects it is still effecting my body and it isn't healthy. So I stopped.

Has anyone had any experience with mdma/pills just plain not working anymore? I haven't been on any medication and my lifestyle hasn't really changed in this time so I cant figure out whats causing it.

Do the doctors from the clinic will be able to tell which exact opiate I did after giving positive for them?*

Hi,

I am sure tomorrow my antidoping test will be positive for marijuana and opiates. This is not for work but to my parents so they can know I am not doing hard drugs anymore. Their thoughts are that I am doing meth, but I haven't. I have been only doing black tar heroin for a couple of days ago. 

If I remember well, this type of heroin shows up in the drug screen as a metabolite called 6-MAM, right? I also read that after around 12-15 hours of last consumption, the liver converts the 6-MAM metabolite into morphine... right (again)? So if I'm not wrong, after that time any drug screen test would have it as morphine and not heroin (6-MAM).

That being said, if I'm right then by tomorrow morning any drug test will show only morphine in my system since the metabolite 6-MAM would be gone by that time. That way I am able to say that I did not do heroin but another type of opiate instead that also converts into morphine as well. I heard that codeine does the same thing too, same process. So I may be able to say that I just did some lean with my friends and avoid telling the truth (which it is that I shot up heroin today), am I right?

So will I be fine if by tomorrow I have to tell this in front of the doctors without them being capable to know what is the exact opiate that I just did a few hours ago? Because that is what is driving me crazy right now. I could tell this to my parents but what if they ask the professionals from the clinic? Because if they were still able to look up into my results and could tell opiate exactly I did then I'm screwed.

I’m just like you. I got a mom who cares too much about me, a pops who’s a little hard on me, but really wants the best for my future. 

I’ve pushed it about as far as it can go though. On one hand I’m still that emotional 13 year old kid screaming about something stupid that his parents are trying to show he has to accept is the reality of the situation, and on the other I’m a 27 year old meth addict who still trying to convince everyone he’s that 13 year old kid, just “Nathanael Pooper Scooper Cooper King”, the one who still does the whole formation when he does a back handspring in front of his family cause that’s the only way he knows how to do it, even though the cousins on his moms side laugh at him because of it, so what? They can’t do it. I’m the one showing off now. 

I can still do it by the way. Arms going wide, down to my side and all before I take off suddenly and flip my body in crazy rotations. I can still do The whole formation. You wanna see me do it? Will that show you I’m still me?

I can also put a needle into any vein on my arm in the dark, and shoot five times as much meth into my heart as most people can because my tolerance is so high, but it only feels like a couple adderall are circulating through my veins. 

And boy does it make me cry. 

Even now I’m sobbing loudly, and in the other part of the house I live in that the landlord owns, the family is renovating the inside of the house with laughter, a daughter and her husband, the mother and father and their friend picking on them softly, but everyone laughing, painting the walls together with family, love, happinesses, no care of emotion, just doing what makes tomorrow better. 

And here I am drawing the thick sludge of clear liquid into the needle,and I know that with how many crystals that are in it, it might stop my heart, and I kind of hope it does, please, just make it dark, make it so that the day won’t ever start again, do I really have any friends or are they all just images of what I remember as myself, the 13 year old child who’s never really known grief, but thinks he understands the world? Are they truly there or do they actually understand how far I’ve gone while I’m just reminiscing, begging for time travel to exist so I can redo what I’ve fucked up, please, please family just know I’m sorry, but I have to take this shot because I just have to feel what’s at the end of that empty needle, I just have to feel something other than what I am, existing before it hits, please god let it hit.

For a long time now I've building my own concept of a high functioning, not harmful yet consistent way to do drugs in order to have maximum benefit with little to no negative consequences.

**So what the hell am I talking about?**

Well, my path to this very moment has been weird in a not very uncommon way, since many people may have been on the same journey.

I used to believe all the usual lies and miths that people tell about psychoactive substances. I believed that getting addicted was extremely easy, that weed was indeed a gateway drug in and of itself, that doing drugs was morally wrong.

Now, older and more experienced, I understand that, despite the fact that there can be some level of truth in those statements, it's all much more complex. I now believe that you can enjoy pretty much any drugs without harming yourself or others, given that you just use common sense.

So, how would I see myself using drugs in this 'healthy' manner? Well, basically it would look something like this:

* Safer drugs like weed and alcohol could be used in moderation 2-3x a week (in my case, weed could be used a little bit less moderately than alcohol, which makes me feel a lot worse the next day)
* Painkillers like oxy would be better used as an infrequent gift to myself on special occasions, like after a very stressful day or something like that, maybe twice a month
* Psychedelics like shrooms would be great if I could find a responsible trip sitter, and would require some preparation, so once a month at most would be possible
* The big three: meth, crack and heroin. Not interested, not even to know how they feel tbh.
* Benzos and stims: Why would I put uppers and downers on the same category? Well, they're both simply medications for me. Both feel good but I'm more interested in how they can help me navigate through life so, AS NECESSARY would be a good label for them. So twice a week? everyday for weeks? once a month? whatever my life demands atm

&amp;#x200B;

Is it possible my wife was roofies with a small dose? So here's the situation my wife had three quarters of a bottle of wine over the course of maybe four hours. Midnight rolls around and she wants to go out to the bar and by 12:17 she's blacked out She doesn't remember anything after taking 1 shot with a co-worker who we suspect had a drug problem. At 1:00 a.m. the power went out in the bar so I went to pick her up and the look in her eyes was fearful like she didn't know who I was and angry and aggressive and scared. She doesn't remember anything from 12:17-ish to about 2:30 in the morning. Would it be possible that she had gotten Roofied? I've seen my wife drink two and even three bottles of wine and drink you know all night at parties until the early mornings hours and still be coherent. From being dropped off to being blacked out is less than 15 minutes. She essentially remembers getting dropped off seeing the coworker having a shot and that's it until maybe 2:30 almost 3:00 in the morning. So I'm just wondering if maybe it was like a half dose or a small dose or if it could just be plain old alcohol but I have a hard time believing that. And as far as the charges go there was only a charge for one drink on the card. It is possible that someone else picked up a tab but for her to drink that much in less than 45 minutes would be insane. She would have essentially had to been doing shots for 45 minutes straight because I've never seen her that blacked out. Anyways I'm just looking for any input that you guys may have on the situation or if there is another drug that she could have been slipped to have only affected her memory for what equates to a short amount of time. From my limited understanding of roofies it's usually a kind of all night five to six seven hour blackout. So it seems like it's almost too short to be roofies but could a smaller dosage possibly account for such a quick blackout.,True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,698100,public,confidence,self,Wife possibly dosed with roofies?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/i0zzr2/wife_possibly_dosed_with_roofies/,no_ads,0.0,1596193452.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fast forward to highschool I’m 15 in 2015 lol. He’s hooking me up at highschool because his mom was prescribed bars. I would buy 3-4 every day or two and take them from first period to my last. He never once fucked me over. 

Fast forward and we smoke together after school almost every day and I’m the only one bad on bars. He never shorted me except once I went to trade him some .5’s for bars my friend wanted. We make the trade and it’s all good, we are behind his house and he walks back
Inside. I walk around the house to my truck and see someone inside it, it’s him stealing my stash of .5’s. I chase him around to the back of his house, middle of the suburbs and I corner him behind his outside door. He had a wooden chair he sits in to smoke so I pick it up and tell him give me my shit, I’m guessing he locked himself out or something because he looks terrified. I take the chair and hit him in the face with the seat and smash his head through the glass window on the door. I grab my shit out his pockets and dip because it was his moms house and she was home. 


Anyways years later he still sells and had pharma bars. I was buying for a few months no problem till he ripped off my best friend. We needed 30 bars and he shorted 6. We called and  tried to get our money back but he had already ran off. My boy was pissed obviously and I felt like shit since I trusted the guy. It was the most money I’d brought to him and he always had Xanax on deck daily so I don’t get why he did it besides he was barred out. 

Fast forward I hadn’t taken Xanax in a few weeks and was looking for some for two days. I hit up the guy he even used to send me to, no luck. Last resort I hit up the bartard plug and he says he’s got me. I pull up thinking I’m driving to a robbery because I may have told him I’d light his house up. I only had 10$ with me and this guy was smaller then me and couldn’t fight so worst come to worst I was fine. 

He actually hooked me up, he had pharma bars and pharma 1mg’s. He apologized and told me he’s giving me free pills when he gets his shipment in.

I’m not entirely sure if his job was the main cause of this. I knew he did hard drugs when he was younger. And a few times last year. Meth was snorted and smoked from this past April until June. 

Am I an naive for thinking his job was the main culprit...? Was he doing drugs more than what I knew and that is why he no longer has a septum. The coke and meth  ate away at it and he got an infection?

The wedding is easy going, like 20 people and the very basic wedding set up (a DJ, a caterer, and wedding photographer will be attending) in the bride's parents country property backayard.  A budget wedding if you will.   

I knew this would suck, even though I like writing, it is mostly fiction I create ( i have pages and journals full of rambling that I can decipher and enjoy, but any one else would send me to a physiatrist). So this has me all fucked up. I decided to get decently drunk before trying to write it and also started doing some bumps to influence me.  There is a sweet spot between the two buzzes where I will start hammering the keyboard producing run on sentences and build ups with no point, but i'm not there yet. I plan to get a rough copy down while fucked up and over the next 20 days (that is how long to wedding) weed out the obvious non essential nonsense.  

I want to keep it under 5 minutes. It just feels so forced and cringy. Like i'm not even the type of guy to attend a wedding, if it was a 30 thousand dollar wedding i'd probably get to fucked up and laugh in their face that they needed to spend that much. I know I will be a lil fucked up when I recite it. I got mad social anxiety... like i'm sure anyone doing a speech would, but i'm such a pussy/anxiety ridden that i'll leave text messages unanswered for weeks at a time. It is the real deal as far as i've gathered from anxious people

I think my biggest obstacle will be staying sober enough to not look like a drunk idiot. I have a major tendency to completely sabotage holidays for my self (and family events) by doing as much of whatever dug I got at home. 

Example: 2 christmases ago I stayed up all night smoking crack and drinking straight liquor. Parents seen me in the morning and were like ""are you sure you want to go to your aunts for christmas?"". In my mind I calculated I could last long enough/my drugs would last to make a ""normal"" appearance. Well flashforward to noon (and at my aunts) and i'm beyond drunk, sneaking off to do lines in the bathroom and kept drinking the rum I brought. Moments before dinner i'm out front with some family when I start twitching/shaking. I couldn't stop. It was so weird. I was trembling and swaying and I knew it was visible. My older uncles and cousins were like ""dude wtf, are you alright?"". In that moment I would normally pass it off as nothing and excuse myself till I could snap out of it. But that was not an option, I was in full blown fear because i'm currently outing my self by tweaking. I was like ""no i feel fucked up, i'm going to go lay down"" and proceeded to walk to my moms car and lay in the back seat. 30 min later and the word had spread that I was fucked up and passed out in a car;mid winter mind you. It was like -15 degrees celsius or colder. My parents came and checked on me and drove me home, no matter how much i petitioned that I was fine and need to nap for a minute.  

If i am able to write a decent speech that carries on for a few minutes that would be great. Most of my family low keys knows i'm a fuck up and would like to surprise them with some well thought out ""points"". 

The risk is: the worse/less i prepare, the more I am going to crutch on booze and stims. The better I am able to piece it together, I can stave off getting fucked up until all eyes are off me and would gladly due the speech sober.

Currently i'm looking at templates and youtube videos. I will not copy pasta a speech, I do want to make it my own because yes I do realize that it is a special moment for my brother and I want to act as a normal member of society and give him the speech he deserves.

As someone who can really fall asleep at any point I choose, past the seven hour mark, I wanted to point out a few things that I do when I’m ready to go to sleep (without benzos). 

1.) Weed. I, as do most people, like to smoke weed on the comedown 

2.) alcohol. A few drinks dulls the trip &amp; helps quiet your mind a bit

3.) Benadryl. 25-50mg of Benadryl 1.5hr before going to sleep is helpful

4.) Getting exercise. Tiring yourself out before you start tripping or during your trip makes things easier 

5.) listening to relaxing music. 

6.) Phenibut. I like to take phenibut before a trip, as it helps curb anxiety &amp; put me in a good headspace, but given that it lasts all day &amp; becomes progressively more sedating, it also helps you sleep once the trip is over.

What regulates an addict's likelihood to overdose? Why are drug overdoses more likely in unfamiliar environments? Do drug paired cues like the drug taking environment &amp; drug tools like needles, or even the people the drugs are typically used with, prepare the brain for incoming drug effects? 

Novel stimuli are often involved in addiction learning and memory, &amp; often mean life or death for those with addiction, here is one example. 
In this clip we comment on the dramatic increase in overdose fatalities that occurred in Vancouver BC during the 2010 Olympic winter games when city officials shifted a large number of homeless youth out of the downtown east side, into regions of the city they were unfamiliar with. We also discuss why addicts are more likely to overdose in unfamiliar environments and the neuroscience of pavlovian conditioning as it relates to drug addiction.

I must say, it made my work day 10x better. I was talkative, energetic and had no fatigue whatsoever, which I usually do have. 

My work days are usually very depressing, the job is so boring and I always end up bullying myself in my head. Not only this’d working back to back days means no more than 6 hours sleep, usually 4-5. 

So I was wondering, has anyone tried this before? I’m talking for work, sports, business start-ups, gym etc. 

Are there serious repercussions for doing something like this? I feel like I could plan the usage to keep it safe. 

Also, I generally don’t have an addictive personality, it’s easy for me to give things up. I’m just curious as to whether this is a viable way of improving my work life, athleticism or entrepreneurship.

I have a pretty interesting story and i want to share with you.
I was chilling with my friends at the beach ( everyone was on the one tab of acid) and my friend had DMT vape juice. Everyone  was amazed of the effects, we were laughing, having a great time. Then I accidently took too many puffs( maybe around 8-10) and i stood up. I looked at my friend and his head was like x3 times bigger( at that moment i kinda got scared, like what the fuck is happening).Everything became like plasticine texture as well as my body(it felt like i turned into a rubber), I looked at my hand and there was a finger missing. And thats where i really panicked. I couldnt understand what was happening, and suddenly my friend collapsed like legos and dissapeared in the ground, after few seconds i collapsed too and it felt like a death ( everything became red, i couldnt think or speak) The whole experience was actually very scary, the feeling itself was VERY disgusting.Then I woke up shocked and said to myself that i wont take DMT ever again. 
‌And the story doesnt end here.
‌After a week of DMT trip, I went to a party with my friends. I was very keen to try candy flip ( i've taken acid or ecstazy dozen times before). I Took a tab( 150ug), went to a party and  took a half of pill right before the peak. I was feeling pretty good, after some dancing i went to buy some water. Right after i bought it, i felt really weird, i barelly understood what was going around, and suddenly everything became like made out of plasticine( this is the only explanation of dmt patterns for me). I got really scared, i questioned myself: why does it feels like i just smoked some dmt? Well, as i was walking towards some chairs, i collapsed( it felt like i died) in front of a lot of people. I woke after few seconds, and at that moment i really thought something happened to my body and I am dying. Long story short: my friend brought me home, because i was panicking, pleasing to call an ambulance and shit. The whole dmt flashback( if i can call it) lasted for about 3-4 hours.
‌
‌Now i am really scared of any kind of psychadelics. Also, i have a fear now if i smoke too much weed, the dmt will slap me again.
‌Any thoughts why it happened ? Maybe you had similar experience?

**Some quick background:**

I am a young adult, financially independent and live in another city than my parents. I have a brother who is a senior in college and still dependent (but just received a confirmed job offer and will be independent when he graduates). 

I recently came back to my hometown to work from home due to COVID. My parents have planned to amicably divorce for some time now (original timeline is that they would divorce following by brother's graduation). My Dad has struggled with alcoholism since he was young and would occasionally use cocaine while drinking. My Dad has had several year periods of sobriety since I was very young (i.e. \~12yrs when I was born, then another \~4yrs, and more recently \~3yrs). 

&amp;#x200B;

**Recent events:**

Since I have returned home, my dad had a bad relapse with alcohol (after that \~3yrs of sobriety) and ended up drinking 3 times. He also admitted that he had been using cocaine. Long story short, my mom and I have realized that he has been using cocaine frequently (as in almost daily) for the past several months. This resulted in him getting sinus infections / gum issues (I believe from gumming the coke) / and a constant running nose. 

Very recently (I imagine in the last month), my Dad has started using crack. I believe he may have switched from coke to crack due to the sinus/nose issues the cocaine was causing him (and potentially he was simply looking for a more intense high). From what I can gather, he is using crack daily and frequently throughout the day. Note that he attempts to conceal this from my mom and I and has no idea that we know. 

As part of my Dad's relapse with alcohol (and the fact that he was driving very drunk several times), my Mom had decided to accelerate the divorce process and file immediately. My Dad also wants a divorce so they are doing this on amicable terms. 

I am of the opinion that my mom and I should not confront my Dad about his crack abuse until the divorce process is complete (as in, assets are divided, contracts are figured out, etc.) so, if my mom needs to, she can walk out of the house in a matter of minutes and be fine. I worry that if we confront my dad during the divorce process, he may get violet/irritated, expensive lawyers may need to become involved in the process, and my mom currently has no where else to conveniently live.

My question for those in this subreddit who either have experience with crack addiction, and I making a grave mistake here in not confronting my father now since he just started this? Is there a materially higher risk that I lose him to this addiction to me waiting the few months for the divorce process to complete before some sort of intervention?

I know there is not going to be a perfect or known answer here. I hope you can understand I'm trying to simply use you all as a sounding board / see what the collective opinion may be.

Two years ago we did a lot of lsd over the course of one month. By the end of our fun time, I had a bad trip and decided to actually do some research about what exactly it was we were doing. I found that lsd can cause schizophrenia in people who have it run in the family, or who are very susceptible in getting it later in life. 

Her mother has very intense paranoid schizophrenia. She has done almost any drug you can think of since she was 16, suffering from abuse during those times, and taking a lot of lsd led her to where she is today...and it is not pretty.

I'm terrified my friend is going to go down the same route.

After that month, I told her that we probably shouldn't do that anymore and she matched my feelings of discomfort as well and agreed to make a pact to never do it again.

She went through a lot during college and recently graduated. I was so happy for her..but she struggled deeply with relationships. She cant stay single, which usually isnt a bad thing, however she got engaged to a guy, they broke it off, and she went through two different guys after that before dating the one she's currently with...in the span of 9 months.

This is where her mother started. And now my friend is doing lsd again. She did it earlier this year and promised it was just a one time thing, i saw her yesterday and she said her and her boyfriend did six tabs over the weekend.

I'm so worried. She's been acting very differently. When i confronted her about it, she acted like she didnt remember even promising something like that.

I dont know what to do. If i confront her about anything, she thinks I'm attacking her and trying to tell her what to do, even when I explain to her that I only do that out of love and support.

a few days ago was my first time taking adderall. im a 5’3” female who weighs around 100 pounds. my friend had some and asked if i wanted any and to start off i took two 5mg pills orally. i waited about an hour and felt nothing so then i took two more but i snorted them this time. i waited a half hour and felt nothing... then i snorted three more. i started feeling it but it wasnt as intense as i wanted it to be so i snorted two more... i then began really feeling it. i was in a great mood and i was being very talkative and interested in everything. i just wanted to do stuff. then about two/three hours later i started feeling like absolute shit. my heart was beating super fast, i was very very anxious and genuinely thought i was going to have a heart attack. i didnt sleep that day or the day after and didnt eat anything for those days as well, the thought of food repulsed me (which i have heard loss of appetite is common with this drug) additionally i was so on edge and anxious and felt so much more depressed than normal for those two days. i asked my friend and she says that usually doesnt happen to her so im assuming it was because i took too much my first time?? i think i took a lot not realizing it would hit me all at once in a few hours?? i was basically trying to feel that euphoria and alertness that comes with taking adderall unprescribed. 

anyways,,, i just want to know how much adderall i SHOULD take to feel good without feeling like fucking garbage for the following days. also i heard that u should stick to taking them orally so u dont have an awful crash after... is that true?? i want to take adderall again but i want to do it right so i just want some advice on that, should i take half as much next time and stick to that and let it kick in?? should i take like two pills less?? should i not snort them?? i just want some advice

Won't get one unless I arouse suspicion but I feel like I'm setting off some alarm bells. Ignoring my phone all the time, having no money even though I should have plenty (my financial situation is monitored cos I'm not a responsible adult at all).

Just kinda rambling now. Don't see that I'll get away with it much longer. Need to avoid people when it's hot out as I can't wear a t shirt cos my arms are a mess.

Drugs use is a huge taboo around her and extremely serious. I steered clear of it. Until a year ago I had an opportunity to do my internship in the Netherlands.. where I had my first encounter with drugs just because it’s so common there. It was a giant culture shock seeing how open people are with drugs, I took awhile to get used to seeing weed as something so... normal and accessible. 

I befriended some local Dutch friends who invited me to experience drugs. I wasn’t pressured to it at all, they invited me, sent me numerous article links for me to read up, urged me to educate myself before trying anything. Which I did, I took two weeks to read up everything I found online (sadly wasn’t a reddit user back then cos this sub is certainly helpful!) 

I slowly tried things. First, weed. I found it okay. 

MDMA followed next. It was very enjoyable. I got what everyone said about having so much love with everything. 

Then acid. This blew my mind. I remember my first thought when acid hit was - nothing I say can ever be credible again, because I finally know why people do drugs. I was enlightened, although I wouldn’t say it was life changing. But I definitely treasure the two experiences (acid and mdma) very much, two of the strongest experiences in life.


Months passed and I’m back home again. Found myself in a sticky position. Am working two jobs now. Also have issues from family, friends, dating and what not so everything is just stressful and overwhelming. So draining to just hang in there and not break down everyday. 
Most of all, I long so much, so much to do MDMA or Acid again. I just want to take my mind off things, relive the good times, or just pop it, do nothing and listen to my music would’ve been heaven already. But alas, I’m reminded of where I am, and how serious drugs use is in this place.
Yeah sure I can get contacts if I wanted to, but the risk is just way too high. Plus I live with my family. 

Sorry for the rant. I read this sub everyday and just living vicariously through you all. Maybe one day when I go back to Netherlands I’ll get to experience it again.

Or I could set it to open the next day after a business meeting.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Another important lesson, you need to set aside your smaller amount and reset the timer *every time* you open it to continue the harm reduction.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have to be very careful with the timer lest you screw it up - nothing more frustrating than not being able to get to your dope after you&amp;#39;ve waited all day for it!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The safe comes with a key that can open it anytime - the instructions advise &amp;quot;giving it to a friend&amp;quot; but I leave it at home where I can&amp;#39;t get to it easily from work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I KNOW this is just addict folly and I need to get serious about recovery. If you&amp;#39;re in recovery already this is NOT the solution for you. But for now I&amp;#39;ve found this may be a good solution to people who haven&amp;#39;t started recovery and to keep their functional life together. This for me reduces harm just a tad, but certainly is not a great way to quit altogether.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone else ever tried something like this to reduce harm? Happy to answer questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Love and hugs to everyone struggling right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mark&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**UPDATE: I staggered my use throughout the day today and it worked! Its hard because it multiplies the craving/reward cycle which is annoying, but I&amp;#39;m functional, not twisted up and going home 95% sober to the fam.

I’m experienced with all sorts of substances from acid to alcohol. I always handle my drugs well. I’m never the guy who gets too fucked up or who does dumb shit while under the influence. I took pride in the fact that I handle my drugs well. I work full time at a hospital in the ER/OP doing registration. My job is stressful and exhausting. 

So I dosed 300mg mg of phenibut yesterday morning, about 9:30am. This was the second day in a row dosing phenibut, which i know is frowned upon but I’ve been on week long- month long binges before, without any issues. Also, 300mg is such a low dose, not to mention that the last time I took phenibut previously was months ago. 

I had a completely normal day at work, I worked 1-8 so nothing too heavy. When I got off I came home and walked to the park near my house to smoke weed with my friend. We had rolled 2 blunts and started smoking on this bike path sorta thing. We smoked the blunt rolled with MY weed first. 

As we were walking, it had started to rain quite heavily, so we took shelter at the outside patio area of this golf course club house. 

It was pretty nice out regardless of the rain so we decided to start smoking the other blunt. This blunt was rolled with my FRIENDS weed. He starts it off and after hitting it a few minutes he passes it to me. I take maybe 4-5 hits right away. At this point my friend goes “lemme show you this picture on my phone,” so I get closer to look at this picture and as soon as I did so I felt this insane head rush. My entire body felt extremely heavy and my head felt extremely light. I was just looking at this picture on my friends phone when the edges of my vision began to get VERY blurry. 

Very quickly my entire vision go quite blurry to the point where I could not see a single thing. Now this part is hazy of course but this how much I recall: my eyes were open but I could not see anything at all. everything was intense heavy colorful static and I began to lean forward. I remember hearing my friend say “yo are you alright? why are you leaning like that” The next thing I can remember I’m sitting on a bench with like 7 paramedics walking towards me. 

I had absolutely no clue what had happened, I was in no pain, and I didn’t think what had happened to me was a big deal. 

The paramedics asked my friend what had happened and this is where I figured everything out. 

My great friend said: “So we were smoking weed, and he started to lean into me so I was like calling his name and trying to get his attention but he just collapsed. He was passed out on the ground for about 1 minute before he got up moved to the bench and tried to reach his water bottle, he missed with his hand and I guess he passed out again for a few minutes before you arrived here.”

It is the next morning now and I can recall a few details of the “blackout” I’m quite sure I was conscious while passed out on the floor. I don’t know whether my eyes were open or not but I couldn’t see regardless. I remember I felt extremely comfortable, I was never in pain or felt like something was wrong. I can remember my friend calling my name over and over and asking if I was alright. He kept asking if he should call my brother or parents but I just heard him I couldn’t reply. 

Anyway, after I came to, like 7 paramedics were surrounding me asking me all these questions about whether I had taken anything besides weed, I didn’t even think to mention the phenibut, I just said I had drank a lot of coke. Which is true, I do drink a lot of soda throughout my day. They placed all these stickers on my skin attached to wires which i guess was to check my vitals. Suddenly my boss shows up. Yes, I work at the hospital in the ER so everybody knows everybody’s business. That straight pissed me off. And the next thing I know my parents appear as well. I’m not sure who called them because in my head only about 3 minutes had passed since I was completely fine. 

At one point there were about 15 people around me including my family and my boss. I felt extremely overwhelmed and confused. I don’t think anyone realized that I had absolutely no idea what the fuck had happened. I was so out of it and confused that I didn’t think to say anything for myself. I was pretty silent through the entire process, only replying to yes or no questions. They explained that since i was 19 i could make the decision for myself whether i wanted to go to the hospital or not. I just said “I want to go home and go to sleep.” Everyone left and my parents drove my friend and I home. 

When we get home my dad starts scolding me about using drugs, asking me who I got them from, etc etc, right in front of my good friend. 

Next my dad tells me to go inside. I was like no fucking way. I needed to talk to my friend first about what happened. My parents said they wouldn’t leave me alone so I ended up just going inside. 

I’m hurt because my dad never once asked if I was okay or if I knew what happened. He just kept saying that I had made a horrible decision and that my “actions speak for who i am.” 

The rest of the night I tried to pretend like everything was normal, I watched netflix then went to sleep. 

Here I am now at 10am the next day just straight confused about literally everything that happened. I asked my friend to give me a very detailed recount but I think he was stressed the fuck out with this situation so he just told me the same thing he told the paramedics/cops. 

I don’t know why this happened, how this happened, but I do know I prayed to God the night before this incident to “fuck my life up” I said I would rather have something really terrible happen to me than to continue on with my extremely boring life. This is Gods reply. 


I felt absolutely completely 100% normal, I was in a great cheerful mood before this incident. 

I was completely fine until I wasn’t.

I’ve struggled with addiction in my teenage years, and after months of denying my issues, I decided that the only thing that will allow me to make anything out of myself is sobriety. With the help of my mother and father, I was admitted to an IOP program with regular urine screens. The first 3 weeks went well, but eventually I fell back into the same old behaviors that resulted in me taking 90mg of vyvanse yesterday. I’ve already dealt with the guilt, regret, and hopelessness that comes with a situation like this, but I really would prefer to limit the chaos. That being said, when I go to do my urine screen tonight, I am going to make my counselor aware that I will test positive for vyvanse. I am 18 years old, so I was assuming there would be some sort of confidentiality given that I am now an adult. However, I got thinking that since my parents are splitting the expenses with me and using their insurance that they would somehow be entitled to this information. This program is also pretty heavily involved in family therapy. To sum it up, I know I fucked up, and have already gone through the shitty feelings of a relapse, so I was hoping that I could avoid the inevitable explosion of anger and emotional stress that would come from my parents being made aware of it. I’ve always been amazed at this community, and I know this situation may seem silly, but I’d really appreciate if someone with more knowledge could help me understand what my options are.

Also this does not happen when I take other kinds of drugs such as psychedelics or cocaine.

I do not have any history of mental health issues or anxiety issues that I'm aware of.

My current solution is not deciding what to do until as late as possible. But this is very annoying for myself and for friends who'd like to know if i'm in or not. And it also increases the anxiety to the absolute maximum for the last hour until it kicks in.

I'll share the MJ story, we had just landed in SF for business. I had this rule I'd never try marijuana for ten years from when I was a soldier. I asked to borrow an associates e-cig and noticed it had a green light. I was low key unset I had broken my rule but was curious to try it properly. 

  
 My friend invited me to try some nicer stuff. I bought a bottle of whiskey and he and I snuck onto the rooftop of our hotel. We shared this expensive joint, passing between one another. We chilled, looking over this new cityscape that sprawled across the horizon. He and I, talking about our ambitions for the years ahead.

Just before he died, he'd raised a few million in Pre- Series A for his pharma startup. He only indulged in recreational use for special occasions. After some wine and a few lines, he fell asleep, and never woke up. His mother found him the following morning. 

 I don't know exactly how he died, but I know how he lived, he was a great friend and I truly miss him like a brother. I caught up with his mother to check in on her, she's alone now and I was telling her a sanitized version of this story.

Summer has been boring the first month. so me and two other friends decided to get some molly and chill for the night. So me and my one friend we’ll call him tug and my other friend guy. So me and tug meet up to pick up a gram of molly we get it smoke some weed then I dip back to my house, tell later tonight cuz tug is supposed to be staying the night at guys house. So at like 6 we meat up and before we go back to guys house we decided to take a point. So we’re chilling and it’s like 28 degrees out side. We start making are way to guys house to talk smoke listen to music etc. We get there and we go to the garage to smoke. we were chilling when my friend search up if smoking weed runes the trip, it didn’t say it did it just said it gives you more anxiety. We decided to head inside to chill wait for the come up. So we wet are hair before going inside (note we’ve been walking for like 2 hours) so we sweaty af then tug asks for a towel. that’s fine guy goes and gives him a towel and then he asks for some water. Then tugs said in a kinda Panic tone “you guys I’m feeling nauseous” guy said in a panic tone “you should go to the washroom” this hole time I’m keeping calm saying “everything fine man it will pass it’s normal” to calm him down. So this hole time he’s drinking his water then pukes, it’s not that bad and I have a strong stomach all he had before was a high chew and some doctor pepper. So that’s what it looked like he feels bad cuz it’s guys room so he’s said “I’m sorry man I’m sorry” guys like “it’s all right man it happens” I’m like “it’s not even that bad” the towel cleaned it up. But tug is drinking his water this hole time. so he pukes again but it’s all water so it doesn’t matter that much guy got the mop and moped it up. So tug chills out and it’s starting to hit us so we decided to go for a walk and guy didn’t want anyone at the house seeing us geeking. We start walking and we have no clue where to go. “There’s a river just down the road” I suggest. it’s hot out and down at the river it’ll prob be cool. We are rolling pretty hard at this point like you know the normal. Geekin out bonding talking saying “we have the best friend group ever” shit like that cuz we’ve been friends for almost 5 years now and we’ve went through some shit together. So we having a good ass time it’s molly. A little after we start walking back up to guys house to smoke. We smoking and shit as soon as I took the first hit it was weird. I look at tug And we make eye contact and all i can see is his eyes and mouth. So this kid looks like a fucking Alien to me I’m like “nah I’m tripping” then I look at guy. The same fucking think I’m tweaking right now. But I figure it’s just the weed so we left again cuz we decided to re dose but snort it this time so we grab a key and leave. We walking and we in a cracked out place rn and I look over and like 8 guys jump out of a truck and start going into a crack shack so I’m like shit boys there’s a drug run going on over there so I keep kinda looking cuz I don’t want them to see me looking at them. But I’m seeing these people line up like there professional drug runners like two on both sides of the truck two caring bags to this crack shack and one in front of them all. The two guys in front of the truck stay there then they tree others come back jump in the truck and they look like they were holding like pistols and shit but they left but before they left they came down the road we where but we where going on the bike trail so we ran there. They came really close to us tho but they just left on the highway. I feel as if they where tryna give us a warning or something. cuz they came at us there was two other Roads they could have went but back to the story. We got to the bike trial and we fount a nice bench in the shade to snort it we were done rolling so we snorted 2 points then left to the Main Street to walk around we got there like an hour. so we snorted 1 other point then I decided to go home after going to McDonald’s.to get water and shit. it was like 12:00 and I still have a little ways to go cuz I live far. but when my friends got home they snorted one more point I feel like we wasted a lot cuz we snorted 4 points and also the 3 points we ate between us so idk what you guys think",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,697932,public,confidence,self,I think we wasted .7 of a gram of molly,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/i0lt11/i_think_we_wasted_7_of_a_gram_of_molly/,no_ads,0.0,1596143563.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Clarification, I am an emt and parmedic intern so I know that morphine drops peoples’ blood pressure). They told me it was gonna be okay. They gave me warm blankets all over and cycled the blood pressure multiple times which leads me to believe that my BP was low and they needed to keep rechecking if I am going to crash and die. A couple minutes later I started feeling better and the nurses left the room to deal with other patients. So I laid there alone since no one was allowed to visit due to covid.

I am 18 (verge of 19) years old and I had a rough last year. I am diagnosed with moderate Depression, anxiety and signs of schizophrenia. 

I was put on a few medications by my psychiatrist. Those where, Lorazepam and Mirtazapin. I ended up getting a psychosis from Mirtazapin.(Long story, if you wanna read it, it's pinned to my profile). 

I ended up in a mental hospital where they diagnosed me and pumped me full with meds. I had days where I would get like 6 different pills a day. I was fucked up. During the time I started smoking weed more regularly, as it calmed me down and made me feel so nice.

I tried weed a few times before, first time with 17, and always have liked it. I ofcourse drank alcohol every few weekends since 15 (Which is actually very normal in my country as the drinking age is 16). I also had one experience with mushrooms at 18. Was very pleasant, perfect setting and me and my friends had a great time.

But this was the first time I did drugs alone. I did it to cope. My hospital was very chill and the would let you leave 5 hours a day if you behaved!! So after all my therapy sessions I went home and smoked some weed, came back, chill out. Not daily but like three times a week. 
A new drug was added. I read up on dxm, I couldn't believe you could order that stuff online. I researched a lot and was aware of the ssri interaction so I didn't them on the day of a trip. Tried 150 mg with weed, never was so stoned. I liked it. Didn't do more till I got out of the hospital though. 

After I left the hospital I almost felt as if things got worse. The pain of my anxiety wasn't there, the racing thoughts wheren't there but duo to me being on Antipsychotics I also didn't feel much else. At that time I moved out of my mums flat into my own flat which I always looked forward to, but was at an comically bad moment as quarantene just started at this exact moment and now I'm stuck with nothing to do as I quit school to go to the hospital. The only thing that seemed to make me feel good was dxm and weed. I experimented more with dxm and found my favourite dose of 450mg (did 600 once but it was a bit too disorienting for my taste). At the beginning I kept 2 week breaks, but not for long. It started becoming a weekend thing, then twice than thrice a week. I also dabbled with dph because i was curious, which was probably the most stupid thing I took... THRICE!! Luckily I took no damage from it. This was the point I realised this is leading nowhere so I quit both weed and dxm. It wasn't necessarily that I was addicted to those substances, more so to the act of being high, feeling different, without depression and anxiety.

I wanted to feel sober again, but those damn antipsychotics make me so sleepy i wasn't even awake 2/3 of the day. The rest of the day I was a groggy mess. My new psychiatrist didn't answer the phone like ever. So I just decided myself to stop taking them (after researching the risks of doing so). It was bliss. Like I actually got to feel life again. I noticed that I was more prone to fall into a panic attack, but I thought the trade off was worth it. Still feeling depressed as always. 

My turning point was, when I started doing mushrooms again. I bought a grow kit online and grew some shrooms. Reason was, I liked the high and was very curious. I also had read that they might help with depression and justified myself by hoping this would help. In the back of my head I said to myself though ""there is no way this would help, like if it did, more ppl would do it"".

I would look at the half time of my ssri I was prescribed and didn't take it before a trip. The first 2 experiences where fun and recreational but nothing mindblowing (I guess thats because of the ssri). Shortly after that I decided to taper of the antidepressants myself (As I just couldn't get a hold of my damn psychiatrist!!!). I didn't feel like they where doing much and I wanted to experience shrooms fully (I know, stupid reason).
Despite the withdrawals I instantly felt better. Could go climbing again at my usual level. Also around that time I started going to work which also helped my mental health and my bank account. Also the shrooms where on a whole new lvl. 

And suddenly it clicked. I guess it's a combination of all factors combined. No meds with horrendous side effects (I got all of them), a job, regular therapy visits for 4 years, my own flat and quarantene is lifted so I can see my friends again. But shrooms felt like they helped me the most. I guess this sounds cliché but they literally opened my eyes. It now is stupidly easy to get rid of an anxiety attack. In the last 4 weeks I had 2 anxiety attacks that lasted under 10 minutes and also haven't felt depressed in a month. I also don't feel any schizophrenic symptoms anymore. I now feel as if I am my old self again, I regained my personality. No more angsty little lump of misery. And I feel as though I gained the tools to battle future bad times.

The only thing that worries me now is my drug habit. Never taking drugs again seems impossible for me. Which is a scary thought as that indicates I have a problem. My main problem is, that I don't have gotten any negative effects of them (Speaking of weed and shrooms, fuck dxm though, to addicting for me). I don't smoke weed during the day or while I'm doing important work. I did shrooms 3 times last month, which seems excessive and I want to try to cut it down to once a month. Maybe more if I see a reason to. 

It is just.. Weed and shrooms seem to help me and I couldn't imagine living without them. Which seems like a very dangerous thought.
Not like I need to cope or anything but it just enhances my life with no downsides that I currently experience. I ofcourse know that weed addiction is not something I wanna chase and shrooms are probably not something you would prescribe to someone who has signs of schizophrenia and already had a psychosis.

Should I just quit while I am ahead or can it be safe If I use those to substances in moderation?

To the the ppl who read this far, you are wonderful and have a nice day &lt;3

I also wanna thank my mom and my dad for being the most supportive and awesome parents I could wish for

Battled depression and anxiety, and won through the help of therapy, a new environment and the power of shrooms. I do way less drugs, especially not the stupid ones.

It was slight but I was convinced I was hearing it. I opened up the door to check and it was no sound whatsoever. This had me scared thinking I was hearing shit. And thought what if I’m about to have a psychotic break of some shit. 

I then went in room and was fine but on edge for the next hour or so. I wasn’t hearing anything but the magical vibe was gone. I then took a Xanax and went to sleep.

A brief intro into why I need you beautiful people's help. 

My wife who I have I've been with for 8 years and we have a beautiful 5-year old daughter together has decided that she wants to leave us both! 

If she just wanted to leave me I obviously still would have been hurt but could understand because those kind of things happen all the time.

She has just rented a new apartment today so this is definitely happening and not just a spur of the moment thing! I have managed to convince her to give me and off of our savings (which I know yes I was stupid that I let all of our savings be in her bank account but I was young stupid and in love). 

This means that me and my daughter have enough money to keep our current house that we're renting for about 6 months but I also know i am going to be be losimg my job when government furlough ends (in the UK).

So basically I have a hell of a lot of shit to try and process and I was thinking some type of psychedelic could maybe point me in the right direction. 

The only time that this can really happen will be this weekend as this is the only time I'm when I won't have my little girl with me as I am going to visit my two brothers who lives down in Brighton who who I am hoping can can strip sit me (one has never taken any drugs in his life and the other is a professional athlete so gets tested often so I doubt either will partake)

The only psychedelics before I've tried in the past are nitrous and AMT. 

Nitrous I absolutely love but let's face it I don't think it's going to give me any insight on what to do with my life. 

AMT I did twice first time I was by myself walking through a park on a summer's day and it was amazing second time within a club and I absolutely hate it and felt sick.

The setting for this weekend is going to nice and chilled with people I love. We will be out doors hiking walking along the beaches that kind of thing.

I know people always say don't do psychedelics if your head space isn't good but but honestly my headspace isn't that bad at all all I'm just need I'm not even sure if you can get AMT anymore so I was thinking is either LSD or shrooms going to be my best bet? Or would maybe even ketamine could help but maybe that's too much of a party drug? 

I can get on the onion Fields so in theory should be able to get anything that you suggest I just might be a little bit worried that I might not be able to get it in time I'm for the weekend (but I suppose I could always get it send to my brother's house but that may be be bit rude)

I really just want as many suggestions and knowledge from you wonderful people as I can.

You can be an anxious person and recieve life changing relief from this medication. BUT. It's easy to abuse. For anxious people the high of benzos (xans,kpins,ativan, etc.) Is the releif of anxiety. A lot of people cam take benzos for medical purposes and not exceed their pescribed dosage per month as benzos are controlled in most states if not all of the USA.

You could be a person who has regular levels of anxiety and you use benzos either to take the edge off in certain situations or ""socially"". Or you take them recreationally which is usually to recieve eiphoric or sedating effects. In other words to get high. 

You can fall into a dangerous relationship w/ benzos that can lead to addiction EASILY if you're in either of those catagories. Or even if those catagories don't summarize you.

Idk, it's just something I get when I appear to be manic lately. All started probably when Trump got elected and it triggered some kind of deja vu with everything I read.

For example, I remember having a conversation about twitter on a certain map on halo 2 with a Jack. I recently talked more about my false memories and now the deja vu got stronger so I decided to go and try to find what proof I have to confirm my suspicions. I really don't know if these memories are false or not.

The gamertags are locked since like 2012 so I'm not doxing anyone btw.

So I remember having a conversation on the map that you played tower of power on in halo 2. I think we were playing tower of power. Not quite sure on that.

Twitter was founded on March 21, 2006. Here is a link to games that are from around 2/20/2006 that have me in a game with a player called Jack's Insanity.

[https://halo.bungie.net/Stats/PlayerStatsHalo2.aspx?player=Jacks+Insanity&amp;ctl00\_mainContent\_bnetpgl\_recentgamesChangePage=21](https://halo.bungie.net/Stats/PlayerStatsHalo2.aspx?player=Jacks+Insanity&amp;ctl00_mainContent_bnetpgl_recentgamesChangePage=21)

I believe the map is called ascension and you would click on an ""Arranged Game"". When I read the gamertag ""Jack's Insanity"", it triggered more deja vu. I had more context for the conversation. When I was 9 I was a loud mouth on xbox live. Not exactly saying ""I fucked you mom"" all the time, but I liked to talk with people especially if they were older.

Not quite sure on the details, but we were talking about implementing ideas or something of that nature that Jack's Insanity couldn't partake in because he wasn't talking to us. So we were describing many ideas. That was the basic jist of it. It was more than 14 years ago and it was very insignificant for 8 year old me.

The thing about this is that I vaugely remember trying to get people to fuck with me in the future and act like they have no idea who they are around me and see if I remember them or not. This is basically what I think is going on.

They know that I take the odd clonazepam for a diagnoses anxiety disorder and have asked for some to help. I feel I would only be hurting them if I did this. 

I am looking for clarification. Is this harmful? Is it safe to detox in this fashion?  Is this person perhaps being deceptive?

But the last 3 years I've been drinking pretty heavily on and off. For one of those years I was also abusing benzos at the same time, but I kicked that habit.

Here's some of the weird symptoms I'm getting:

My hangovers are so debilitating now, to the point where I can't even stomach a glass of water and have to lie down all day. I've even thrown up from them on multiple occasions. And they tend to last all day, sometimes even two. Sometimes they aren't nearly as bad for some explicable reason - but they usually are awful.

My threshold for blacking out has dropped massively. It gets to the point where I start to feel a good buzz, then I can't remember anything else. It's not even enjoyable.

The next day after drinking I get a gross taste in my mouth that lingers all day. If I brush my teeth or eat, then it comes back an hour later.

I get nightmares way more often, and if I'm hungover I get very low quality sleep, if any at all. I also go into these weird semi-lucent nightmares where I can sorta control what is happening and am not fully asleep. These are very weird and kinda frightening.

I took a 3 month break to try reduce my tolerance and it didn't work. Still needed 2+ bottles of wine to get properly drunk.

Are these all normal? Is my liver/brain fucked?

But insufflation likely shortens the duration of effect because it’s not necessarily designed to be used that way.

Anyways... I usually hear people say that snorting stims burns their nasal passages but I personally have never experienced this? 

I crush them with a pill crusher then with razor and usually spend 15 mins getting them into the finest powder I can, then exhale (away from the drugs), place the straw past that little bend (for lack of better words lol) in my nostril and inhale soft and slow to minimize the amount flying into my lungs.

I’ve tried Xanax #2 as well as Mexican Xans so I was familiar with the drug so i bought one without hesitation. Immediately I tested to see if it was legit (it was). That night i bought half and blacked out and found out the next morning i snuck out to hang out with some friends. The following day i woke up very grouchy, fatigued, restless. But i felt a way i had never felt before. I felt confident, loved; it’s like if my brain produced the chemicals it needed to produce in order to maintain happiness. That day i did things I’ve never done before because of my anxiety. I talked to my family, was able to go outside and not worry about eyes on me, but what stood out to me most was no intrusive thoughts. 

Typically, every thought i think has an extra three tagged along. For example, I’ll see a car I like. But then along with that comes “what if it crashes? what if the driver looks at me and thinks somethings up!” Yes. Dumb questions but i couldn’t help it. They just would come in and spark up my anxiety. Here this wasn’t the case. Over the next week I bought more and more Xanax from him because it made me not worry about anything; anxiety was not who i was anymore. I was confident, dependent l, i felt invincible and i didn’t care about anything. I didn’t black out but instead would feel very woozy and tired. The next day i would feel the same sensation again except greater (the sensation of feeling normal). This time Anxiety wasn’t just eliminated but my BPD as well. I was able to feel happy all day, without having constant mood changes as well as suicidal thoughts. Of course with this constant use I got addicted (the withdrawals were hell)and If it weren’t for my ex i would’ve lost my life to Xanax. 

A month later i started doing Xanax again except  they didn’t make me feel as good as they used to. It could have possible been to the fact that i was so used to Xanax or the pill was weaker, but i had to pop an amount that people usually black out on to feel something except that wasn’t the case for me.

If you haven’t started slamming – don’t. It can lead to a huge list of long-term physical and mental health problems and can make it extremely hard to get clean.
For the sake of your health and to lower the risk of addiction, switch to a non-injectable form of the drug if you can. But if you’re going to slam, here’s what you need to know.


*This guide covers:*

* 		The basics 
* 		Equipment and sharing
* 		Preparing to inject: setup, mixing up and tourniquets.
* 		The injecting process: techniques, flushing and clean-up.


*The Basics.*

Learn the difference between a vein and an artery – injecting into an artery can kill. Arteries are deeper and harder to find than veins, but they sit very close 
together.


*Arteries and Veins.*

* 		If you hit an artery, the blood will be brighter and will spurt rather than ooze.
* 		It’ll be harder and more painful to inject your drugs, and the plunger will probably be forced back. It may contain frothy blood.
* 		It you think you’ve hit an artery, pull out straight away and apply firm pressure to the injection site.
* 		If the bleeding continues for more than five minutes, seek medical help at an NHS Walk-in Centre or a GP surgery. If you’re losing blood fast, call 911/ 999.

Use a new needle if you fail to find a vein straight away. To reduce the risk of collapsed veins avoid injecting into the same area.
Avoid injecting into veins in your hand – they’re too small to handle it and could collapse.
Collapsed veins may never recover. Injecting below the waist can cause serious circulation problems if a vein is damaged. Never inject into a site that’s sore or swollen as this area may be infected or the vein may be blocked.

Get to a doctor if an injection site is swollen for more than a few days, if it’s red, hot or tender or if there’s any serious bleeding, the skin changes colour, is sore or weeps.


*Equipment and Sharing.*

It’s important to get the right equipment, and never to share it. Here’s what to do.

*Equipment.*

Use surgical swabs to clean the part of the body you plan to inject into (and swab after injecting too) to keep the area clean – or at least make sure you have soap and warm water to wash the area.
Know where to get clean injecting equipment and take back used equipment (you can do this at needle exchange programmes, some sexual health or GUM clinics, drug agencies and some chemists. You can also buy clean injecting equipment online.


*Sharing.*

* 	The temptation to share is often strongest when coming down from the drug, not before taking it.
* 		Sharing with people you feel close to may feel safer – it’s not. Infections can easily spread between friends and lovers.
* 		Have one container per slam – drawing up drugs from a shared one can risk contamination with infections like hepatitis C when the needle is dipped back in.
* 		Don’t let one swab be used by different people – minute traces of blood on it can also spread hepatitis C.
* 		Use fresh gloves for each person receiving an injection. Latex gloves worn for protection can still carry tiny amounts of infected blood between people if the person wearing them injects more than one person.


*Preparing to Inject.*

To start
* 		Choose a quiet, safe and clean place to inject – at home is best.
* 		Use warm soapy water to wash your hands and wipe down the surface you’ll use to prepare your mix.
* 		Make sure you have all your clean injecting equipment within reach: a syringe and needle, swabs, spoon or foil, water, filter, and tourniquet.
* 		Have an approved sharps disposal bin or a bottle with a lid to put in used swabs and needles.


*Mixing Up.*

* 		With a clean swab, wipe the spoon firmly in one direction. Don’t rub the swab up and down in two directions as this spreads any germs around the spoon.
* 		Put your drugs in the spoon. If sharing a mix with others, you must all have new sterile needles and syringes. It’s important no used equipment comes near a group mix.
* 		Use a clean needle and syringe to draw the water up, sterile (boiled) water is best.
* 		Add the water to the spoon and mix. If you’re using the blunt end of the barrel to mix your drugs, make sure it’s been cleaned.
* 		Put a filter in the spoon – the best filter is a hand-rolling filter, cotton wool or a tampon.
* 		Draw the solution up through the filter to remove impurities. If you’re injecting pills, use pill filters. If you can’t get pill filters, filter your mix at least three times.
* 		Remove air bubbles by pointing the needle skywards and flicking the side with your fingernail. Push the plunger up slowly until the air bubbles escape through the eye of the needle.


*Tourniquets.*

* 		You’ll need one of these to get your veins pumped up enough to inject.
* 		They’re available to buy online for various regions and vendors.
* 		If you don’t have any at hand, you can tightly tie some material, like a clean vest or sock.
Don’t share tourniquets – there may be tiny droplets of blood on it which can carry infections.


*The Injecting Process.*

Here’s how to minimise the risks of slamming and its aftermath:
* 		Try not to touch anything that hasn’t been cleaned until you’ve finished injecting.
* 		Warm your arm and let it hang down to build up blood pressure.
* 		Use a tourniquet and place it above the site where you plan to inject. If you tie the tourniquet too tight you could cut off your blood supply and have difficulties finding a vein – you should still be able to feel your pulse.
* 		With a clean swab, firmly wipe the injection site once.
* 		Put the needle into your arm at a 45-degree angle with the hole facing up.
* 		Pull back the plunger and blood should appear. If it doesn’t then you’re not in the vein. In that case you’ll need to pull the needle out, take the tourniquet off and apply pressure with a cotton ball to stop any bleeding.
* 		When you’re sure the needle is in the vein, loosen the tourniquet before you slowly inject your drugs. If you feel pain or resistance, you may not be in the vein, in which case you’ll need to start again.
* 		Keeping the arm straight, remove the needle and apply pressure to the injecting site for a couple of minutes (use cotton wool or tissue). Don’t use a swab as this won’t stop the bleeding.


*Don’t Flush.*

‘Flushing’ (drawing up blood through the needle, into the syringe, to mix with the drugs) won’t give you a bigger hit – it doesn’t increase the amount of drugs you inject.
When you flush, it’s impossible to avoid some movement of the needle. This will further damage, and shorten the life of your veins.


*Cleaning Up.*

* 		Recap your needle and syringe and put it in a safe disposal container, ready to go back to your local needle exchange once your session has finished.
* 		Never recap other people’s needles and syringes.
* 		Clean the area that you’ve used for injecting with household bleach. If you have no bleach, use warm soapy water.
* 		Throw everything out that has been used and opened.
* 		When you’ve cleaned up, wash your hands and arms thoroughly with warm soapy water. If you can’t, use swabs.
* 		Store all equipment in a clean and safe space.


*How to Clean Equipment.*

One day you might feel you have no option but to share, so it’s useful to know how injecting equipment can be cleaned. However, it’s important to note that it’s never advisable to share needles as they can transfer viruses and bacteria and put you at risk of HIV and hepatitis B and C.
In their leaflet for professionals working with people who inject drugs (Substance Use and Pharmaceutical Care), NHS Education explains how to clean a syringe:

* 		first, rinse the syringe and any other equipment to be re-used several times with clean, cold water
* 		second, flood it with undiluted household bleach
* 		third, rinse out the bleach with more clean, cold water.


It’s impossible to guarantee that ‘cleaned’ equipment is safe to use. Although bleach can be effective when it comes to reducing the spread of hepatitis B and HIV from syringes, this isn’t the case when it comes to hepatitis C. The best course of action is to use new, clean equipment rather than taking a risk.

From my understanding, here's what I've got:

Dosage:

If patches are used, it can help to treat chronic pain and last up to 72h due to the transdermal diffusion.  They will prescribe you with the lowest dosage first before increasing the dosage. People who are opiod naïve should not have it. Common dosage are between 12ug/h and 75ug/h and each lozenge can contain over 2mg of fentanyl.

People who use them in a different way (ingestion or insufflation) feel the effects begin faster, but therefore are also harder to dose and more impredictive. I have no idea how you manage to dose  them, but from my reading, 2mg is the Lethal Dose 50, and 250ug is the lowest letal dosage. So I would say  that a recreational dose stands between 50 and 100ug?  I've seen prescription tablets with 100ug, but were recommanded only for lozenge resistant people, and are meant to dissolve in the mouth (and not be crushed) for 20 mins before being swallowed. I've read in here that the effects are short (under two hours), but this [manufacturer](https://www.rxlist.com/fentora-drug.htm#clinpharm) shares a graph with effects lasting up to 6 hours.

What are your thoughts?

Effects:

They compare it a lot to heroin. From what I've read, it procures euphoria (if true, how intense is it? Can you describe it?) on the come up, sedative effects (i don't really know how that would feel), physical and emotional pain relief. 

Anything else than I'm missing? Could some of you detail their experience with the high of Fentanyl?

Withdrawal:

I haven't read extensively on that part, nor am I able to imagine how it would feel like, but the craving is more physical than psychological, right? Which means strong unpleasant effects will manifest once the effects wear off? How have some of you dealt with them?

Dangers:

Well, this one is straight forward: In recent years, fentanyl and it's derivates are responsible for the most overdoses deaths in the USA. Its small dosage, strong potency and addictive properties (it's an opiod after all) makes it a drug with a truely high potential for misuse and accidents. The prevention mesures used by emergency respondants can be impressive, especially in a high risk context.

Antidote and assistance:

Naloxone can help in the case of overdoses, but breathing assistance is required.  It can help temporarely but may require many other shots of naloxone, which is why calling emergency respondants is a must. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I began reading about Fentanyl, I was thinking: ""It kills, it's an opiod, it's bad"". I got shook when I've seen people on this sub talking about their experiences nonchalantly or how they were planning to suck on a piece of lozenge. I know some of you are experienced drug users, but you can't ignore the fact that fentanyl is a big killer right?

What made you do the jump? Why fentanyl above all other options?

I did 100mg of DXM and 350mg of DPH (was scared to take a lot of dxm since it was my first time) I took both the DPH and DXM at the same time at around 10:15pm 

on with the trip report !

after taking both the DXM and DPH I decided to smoke the last tiny bit of my weed to calm my nerves. as I was finishing smoking I thought I saw flashes of light outside of my window, I thought things might start to get scary soon so I closed my window, locked it, and covered it with the curtains. a little while later my body is now really starting to get heavy and i'm getting very tired. I start to hear things, I hear people walking outside my bedroom, whispering in my ear, people talking but could not make out what they were saying, and a woman calling my name. little later I realize the seashell designs on my sheets were moving and my popcorn ceiling was moving around too. I look closer at my bed sheets and notice that it's covered in spiderweb like white stuff. I can play with it and move it around and it was pretty entertaining to do. then I notice a bunch of clear spiders walking around all over my bed. they look like their legs are made out of translucent hair and their bodies were black. If I smushed them they would disappear and evaporate into the air. if I lay my finger or hand next to them they would crawl on me and tickle me. (most people I hear about seeing spiders say that hated it but I loved it, maybe because I didn't do a lot that they weren't scary looking? the best way I can describe them is ""ghost spiders"" I could see them but also kinda see through them and I had a lot of fun playing with them and letting them crawl on me and tickle me""  after playing with the spiders for a while I turned my head to look around my room. (this is where shit got weird and had no idea why I saw what I was seeing) I look at my wall and out of nowhere a cartoon like alligator ghost comes out of my wall and is holding a sign. the sign is colorful letters spelling out words but the words would change every second and I couldn't make out what it read. I thought this was really weird and kinda funny so I looked at the ghost and said ""oh thank you, but what is this supposed to mean?"" the ghost then smiled and went back into the wall. any time I would look back at the place another ghost holding a sign would come out of my wall. I have an altar in my bedroom with a bunch of candles. I looked at the candles and they were all lit. I get up to blow them out and once i'm at the candles I notice they are all out but a fake flame is levitating slightly above the unlit wick. (this was very trippy) I sit back down and continue to try and watch tv. I hear the sound of rusty swing chains creaking in my closet. I hand a shirt hanging on my closet door handle. when I turned to look at the shirt as my eyes got to it it was floating in the air or off to the side and when my eyes met it it VERY quickly moved back down to a regular hanging position. the entire shirt moved entirely in the blink of an eye. the same thing happened with a coat hanging off my bedroom door. one of the arms was up on the air but when I looked back at it it shot down the arm at light speed to go back to its normal positioning. I kept trying to google things but I would forget what I was typing as I was typing it. this happened countless times , or I forgot what I was doing entirely and ever came back to the phone to finish the sentence. There was a black shadowy circle on my wall and beside it looked like a skeleton like ghost figure was in my wall (like it was painted onto my wall, but trying to come out of it) this was pretty scary to me and every time I would blink he would get more and more out and his face would change. I closed my eyes for 3 seconds and opened them again and he was gone. A bottle cap that was sitting on my desk would multiply every time I blinked until eventually they all combined back into one bottle cap. eventually it seemed like the hallucinations were calming down around 4am. I closed my eyes to go to sleep but then my sister walked into my room to hangout. she started talking about plans with my friends and she started playing guitar. out of nowhere I blinked while talking to her and my eyes were now on a different position in my room and she was gone. she was never in my room. I try to go back to sleep again. my friend walks in my room and starts talking about her ex. once again, one random blink and i'm back, laying down instead of sitting in a different part of the room like I was and she was never there . at this point most of the hallucinations are gone besides auditory own , I still heard a bunch of random sounds, bangs, and voices, but eventually finally actually fall asleep. I woke up to my mom waking me up asking if I was alive because I slept until 3:30pm. 

overall it was a pretty fun experience, there were definitely times that I was very scared especially combined with the overall sense of dread and all the scary auditory hallucinations but if I reminded myself that nothing was real I would feel a little better.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,697739,public,confidence,self,My first DPH and DXM trip report :),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/i08p9f/my_first_dph_and_dxm_trip_report/,no_ads,0.0,1596085408.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ve had a vial that I’ve had for a couple months that I suspect is evaporating. I only took about a 10 strip out of it and it seems like it’s half of what it was when I got it. The solution is something like ever clear that it’s in now. 

I ordered parafilm to prevent future evaporation, and also got distilled water for dilution.

My substance abuse has gone a step higher again. I'm too fucking depressed and suicidal to cope with life situations (no stable roof, possible getting fired very likely, my therapist ignoring me, ""friends"" abandoning and berating me, ""only child"" but got a lil half-sister out of marriage, that hates me and wants nothing to do with me she looks like me and resemble my grandma a lot. The woman I love hates and berates me and doesn't even want to be my friend, but we were intimate best friends in our pre-teens/teen years). Can't even say ""hi, how have you been"", I'll be ignored or blocked. The ironic thing is, she went to great lengths to look for my contact last year because I don't use social media much and I use the name I've given myself, not my legal name, I'm very hard to find. And she insisted on us hanging out, but she then initiated the rejection. First thing she told me ""wow you look cute, you bloomed into a handsome man, you got muscular, I love the way you look, you look attractive"" to me, and she looks like an angel herself"" She even gave me a gift I'll never forget, which I appreciate a lot. Why seek me in the first place? We hadn't seen each other in almost a decade, there was no need to. You have sex with one of my so called ""friends"", which cheats a lot, even had a daughter with another woman while having a girlfriend of 7 years. I don't want your love, just a chance to be your friend, like before, but you don't care. We still have so much in common, so many memories and internal jokes.

She uses too but only smokes weed, she criticized me on my drug abuse, people gossip about me a lot, people betting when will I die, if I'll make it to another year. But I'm high on opiates, benzos, liquor, weed, edible weed and everything is bliss and there's no pain. I hate love, rejection and relationships, got BPD and severe depression and the mood swings are a torture. Need to self medicate with drugs and alcohol to make it through.

NOT ASKING FOR HELP, I'm not a special snowflake, already got a fucking therapist/shrink, I'm just venting out. Literally got no one to talk to about how bad I feel/these situations. No one to cry to. Mom just knows I have severe depression, I tell her to just leave me alone high when I'm suicidal and she has been scolding me directly about my drug/alcohol use, but you don't understand mom. I'm 26, I don't leech off my parents, I've lived by myself since I am 18 (very uncommon where I live, people usually leave home at marriage, late 20s or early 30s, sometimes even 40s), sometimes had to move back home a couple of times, I've been almost homeless a couple of times despite having had stable jobs and incomes. I'm back because of the virus situation and possibility of losing my job. I don't accept anything from my parents, money, favors, anything. Sometimes I accept food from mom. I hate them, I'll never get over the physical and emotional abuse, scars in my skin will never disappear. My mental health is deteriorated since I'm a kid, I'm a serious psychiatric patient for life, I'm mentally ill according to therapists and doctors and they tell me this is serious and I have to treat this or I'll die. I've been hospitalized before. Got three suicide attempts, multiple ODs, visits to ER, got a drug/alcohol problem for life, all this directly caused by cruel upbringing; plus the other problem I mentioned earlier. Have been in a psychiatric hospital for more than 30 days because of a forced impulsive OD to attempt suicide. But no one gives a fuck, why should they? I drank as a kid and mixed it with opiates when I was pre-teen or teen but infrequently.

My sophomore year of uni was the worst where I was taking them nearly everyday and selling them to support my habit. As the story goes I was failing/ dropping classes in toxic relationships and didn’t see an end in sight. 

Somehow I managed to get clean and remove myself from the toxic environment I was in. I had anxiety prior to using xanax and that’s why I fell in love with them. The way I felt while taking them was pure bliss, I was invincible.  

Fast forward a few years clean and I still have crippling anxiety! I understand this is something I will cope with for the rest of my life but has anyone had similar experiences of getting clean and being more anxious than they were before they’d ever taken them? Does it slowly get easier/ better or am I likely to feel this anxious forever? All advice is appreciated!

I got really zoned out for 3 hours and barely had power to move but it was enjoyable.

tl;dr: I wanted to treat my undiabnosed ADD I'm pretty sure I have since I'm a procrastinating daydreamer that goes into monk-mode when on coke with Speed so that I could finally manage to pass some Exams (Electrical Engineering)

I think using speed for my cause is dumb since speed is cut to the core + I have no milligram scale at home rn so I wanted to go with modafinil (I can get 1 pill for 1€ instead of ritalin which is way more expensive).

Can modafinil get me addicted or fuck me up harder if I take it 3-4 days in a row with a break of 2 days? What should I be weary of?

Also as I know you can loose the ""magic"" on  amphetamine if you abuse it.

Still to this day has been the most profound euphoric experiences. That day i toke a 50mg pill and nothing else.  I did it here and there after the first encounter last year, mostly to get high. but i had a break from it and I've recently been dabbling in it again, i have 75mg pills instead of 50mgs and im not having the same response to it like i did last year, the come up would just seem to be the only predominant effect it gave me and a little bit of a head buzz, on and off during the day. Random bodily sensations that felt like pins and needles on my face and on the top of my head. today i toke 140 mgs and it was exactly the same effect as a 75mg pill gave me before hand.  i have a feeling that the vyvanse i have are expired or for some other reason that im not aware of. before i started taking vyvanse this year i was popping mdma on the rare occasion, maybe the mdma drained the magic?  the reason why i toke up vyvanse again was because i got diagnosed as ADD (attention deffest disorder) and the vyvanse im taking, currently, gives me lots of motivation, and i can stick to a task with out getting unfocused.  hopefully sooner or later i can get prescribed a medication that is more suitable for me, but i have to do a drug test and im not too happy with that. I cancelled out the possibility that it could be because i have ADD and the drug effects me differently, because i wouldn't of  felt what i felt the first time i toke vyvanse if that was the case. Im lost on what to do and i need some feed back on what the matter could be, or if so what can i do? it would be very much appreciated.

I intend to try this soon in a safe environment and see if it’s really as insane as everyone says. I don’t know of many people who have done this but everyone who has had their mind blown. My friend who is very experienced with psychedelics (he has tried 5-MEO-DMT, Mescaline, DMT, LSD, ETH-LAD, Psilocybin, etc) but he said that “symmetry” was on another level. He usually goes in depth into describing his experiences but did not have the words to describe this trip.

&amp;#x200B;

Drugs:

ketamine, supposedly and seemingly S isomer, 161mg, in seven roughly equal bumps (approx 23mg each).

Salvia Divinorum 5x extract 110mg + 90mg. Smoked through a bong.

&amp;#x200B;

The Beginning:

\[Written on my phone\]

! 2102 Snorted the first bump of ket.

2127 Dude that one fucking line was massive, effects wise. I believe it was 20-30mg of ket. I feel strong effects from it. This is almost certainly not racemic.

! Snorted more bumps of ket in alternating nostrils at 2139, 2142, 2146, and 2149.

2149 it's getting difficult to understand phone.

2150 can barely read screen of phone

I stopped feeling human for about. I go round and round.

Jesus christ  what is happening .

2153 now it took that long to type

379ms 8 tries. Reaction time I couldn't understand the test.  \[Humanbenchmark reaction time test. My normal is 250-280ms (On my shitty phone)

What's written hereafter was written after the trip was over, based on the trip notes from my sitter as well as my own, limited recollection of what happened.\]

&amp;#x200B;

The Salvia and The Eternity:

! 2155 smoked ca 110mg of Salvia 5x in a bong. Was very difficult to smoke because I was already high AF on ketamine. I couldn't properly hold my breath.

I'm sitting on my bed.

2157 ""I see something, a light""

! 2200 smoke from the bong, after my sitter added 90mg of Salvia 5x on top of that which was already there.

I feel like I'm falling.

""Oh god, what the fuck is happening"". \[Repeated similar statements several times. Also, I don't even believe in god, I just randomly use it as an interjection.\]

I am generally confused.

My sitter helps me lay down in the bed.

A few minutes later, my sitter helps me sit up.

&amp;#x200B;

""Was I gone for an eternity?"", I ask. It felt kind of like I had been gone for an eternity, but I was sobering up slightly now and knew that wasn't reasonable, but I did wonder how long I had laid down for.

In hindsight, I believe it was prior to that question, while laying down, that I \[felt like I\] could see time as like an extra dimension, or something. I saw several possible futures and pasts concurrently next to one another, visually, and couldn't quite tell which one or which ones were real.

""Am I holding something?""

After my sitter tells me that no, I'm not holding anything, I lay down.

I ask what happened, and if I'm safe.

""How long has this gone on for?""

I'm still generally confused, at one point exlaiming, ""What the fuck, what in the fuck, what was that?

... It feels like it's long lasting.

... Oh right, I smoked Salvia, what the fuck"", I say, laughing immediately afterwards.

2207 My sitter helps me sit back up, and I ask once again how long this has gone on for. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Redose and the Machine:

! 2209 I smoke from the bong again.

I lay there quietly. I lift my head up gently, and state:

""I felt somewhat like a tyre for a second.""

I didn't tell my sitter this, but looking back at it, I had felt somewhat like a cog in an incredibly complex machine, which with the spinning motion of a cog turned into me being a tyre - more specifically, the right rear tyre of a sedan that was driving on a city street.

&amp;#x200B;

I lay quietly for a moment, before talking more.

""What the fuck is happening in my head... Impossibilities... So much in my head... I feel like I'm elsewhere. Like \[I am\] god... Or maybe not god... I don't know what I'm saying.""

Again, I didn't specify this to my sitter at the time, but I had felt like a part of a machine, one that could choose which past, present, and future would occur. I related this to the idea of being part of a god, and then I felt like I was the caretaker of the machine, which I associated with being god.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel weird, but want to smoke more.

! 2214 I smoke more (My sitter couldn't tell at the time if I was smoking it properly, or getting anything in at all)

I fall down on the bed.

I feel like I'm falling, ""as in a tyre"" \[no idea what that means\]

""Holy fuck"", I laugh. I state that I can feel everything and nothing at the same time, and that I *am* everything and nothing at the same time.

I see a UFO. Then a city, which looked similar to Atlantis from Stargate, which I had been watching earlier in the day.

I was moving up along one of the towers, at an incredible speed.

""I exist. I didn't notice that for a second.

I feel very weird.

Am I back in the world?""

I hug a pillow

2220 I hug a large teddy bear.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The Ketamine Redose:

! 2222 I snort the two remaining ketamine bumps (ca 23mg each) in different nostrils, and ask my sitter to put on Evan Duffy's piano cover of Strobe.

2225 I'm dancing

""I don't know what the fuck is happening""

I sit down and state, ""I mostly only feel the ketamine \[now\]"", and then I lay down, but quickly go back to dancing and state, ""This isn't my body.""

I drink some water, and say, ""Water is good."" \[I always consider hydration key when taking drugs, and in general\]

I hold up my arms and explain that, ""This feels good.""

I ask my sitter for a hug, while I go back to being confused.

I can't explain to my sitter how I don't know if I exist or not.

I end up listening to some Sabaton, while singing along really badly.

""God, I feel weird.""

2240 ""I think I'm past the peak""

""I don't know what shall happen"" \[referring mostly to the trip itself - I didn't know what I wanted to do, or what I should do.\]

2242 ""That felt like much more than an hour.""

""I feel like I'm a very strange person."" \[I always feel this way.\]

2302 I can taste salvia in my mouth. May have accidentally suck in some (unburnt) plant matter through the bong.

I showered, which felt good, though I was kinda concerned about damaging my body while being anesthezised from the ket.

2340 I do a typing test. I type only about 10-20% slower than my normal, and with slightly lower accuracy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Shortened version:

bumps of (S) ketamine in alternating nostrils, ca 23mg each, at 2102, 2139, 2142, 2146, and 2149.

At 2155 ca 200 mg 5x Salvia extract was partially smoked in a bong, then further at 2200. This ensued:

A lot of confusion, and a feeling that I am falling, before my sitter helps me lay down.

I felt like I could see time as an extra dimension. I saw several possible futures and pasts concurrently next to one another, visually, and couldn't quite tell which one(s) were real.

After several minutes, I asked my sitter, ""Was I gone for an eternity?""

&amp;#x200B;

At 2209 I smoked from the bong again.

I lay quietly, feeling somewhat like a cog in an incredibly complex machine, which with the spinning motion of a cog turned into me being the right rear tyre of a sedan that was driving on a city street. 

A moment later, I felt like a part of a machine, one that could choose which past, present, and future would occur. I related this to the idea of being part of a god, and then I felt like I was the caretaker of the machine, which I associated with being god. During this I told my sitter:

""What the fuck is happening in my head... Impossibilities... So much in my head... I feel like I'm elsewhere. Like \[I am\] god... Or maybe not god... I don't know what I'm saying.""

&amp;#x200B;

At 2214 I smoke more 

""Holy fuck"", I laugh. I state that I can feel everything and nothing at the same time, and that I *am* everything and nothing at the same time.

I see a UFO. Then a city, which looked similar to Atlantis from Stargate, which I had been watching earlier in the day.

I was moving up along one of the towers, at an incredible speed.

""I exist. I didn't notice that for a second.

I feel very weird.

Am I back in the world?""

I hug a pillow, and then a large teddy bear.

&amp;#x200B;

At 2222 I snort the remaining ketamine (ca 46mg)

""This isn't my body.""

I drink some water, and then I try to explain to my sitter that I can't explain how I don't know if I exist or not.

At 2240 I think I'm past the peak, and am uncertain as to what I want to do now.

At 2242 I told my sitter ""That felt like much more than an hour.

... I feel like I'm a very strange person."" \[I always feel this way.\]

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR version

120+40mg (S) ketamine snorted, 200mg Salvia Divinorum 5x in a bong.

I could see several possible futures and pasts concurrently next to one another, and couldn't quite tell which one(s) were real, feeling like I was there for an eternity.

Smoking more, I felt like a cog in an incredibly complex machine, and then like a tyre. 

Then I felt like the caretaker of a machine, one that could choose which past, present, and future would occur, which I associated with being god. During this I told my sitter:

""What the fuck is happening in my head... Impossibilities... So much in my head... I feel like I'm elsewhere. Like god... Or maybe not god... I don't know what I'm saying.""

After smoking more, I can feel everything and nothing at the same time, and I *am* everything and nothing at the same time.

We posted recently about our first two weeks of microdosing, and we just finished our episode summarizing our full four-week microdosing experience, which included interviews with a Psychiatrist in NYC and a researcher from the Max Planck Insitute in Germany.

The experience for us was overall pretty exhausting. It's been two weeks now since we stopped microdosing altogether, and so far I feel more relaxed generally.

Some disclaimers - I think we might have been dosing too highly for the entire four weeks, dosing only every third day per the Fadiman Protocol. There were many times where the jitters were almost overwhelming. Sometimes it was a great feeling though; several days while editing we felt really productive, energized, and creative. Working days were another matter. Life moved at a snail's pace, and it was hard to motivate to do the daily mundane tasks associated with our computer/desk jobs. If I do this again, I won't go over 10ug, and try and stay around 7.5ug or lower.

Speaking with the experts was really fascinating. We spent some time talking about macro doses, enlightenment, spirituality, and psychology, but then also talked a bit about the placebo effect with regards to sub-perceptual microdosing. Both experts seemed to say that while there's probably some amount of the placebo effect involved, there also seems to be some pretty strong evidence supporting other effects including a neuroplastogenic effect - creation of new synapses in the brain on low doses in laboratory conditions. They both spoke about a lot of really fascinating and thought-provoking ideas, some of which I admittedly didn't fully understand.

We put out three episodes regarding our microdosing journey - one before starting to discuss our expectations and address any preconceptions and biases, one halfway (two weeks) through which includes audio clips from our daily ""captains' logs"", and one at the conclusion which includes interview clips from experts in the field. If you wanna check them out, there are links to the episodes in our profile.

I have been on heavy benzos for 10 years, and amphetamines for 14 years. My doctor cut me off cold Turkey last year and I started to abuse meth until about 3 months ago. As for benzos, I only recently started tapering down. 

Even while smoking weed I have the worst dreams.. and while awake I'm just anxious and depressed. I cant do anything but Doordash since my sleep habits are so poor, but I think I'm coming to terms with that. I work out constantly, and if not working out studying poker (my passion), eating healthy, and with the girlfriend.

How long does it take before these symptoms go away? I cant live like this forever. I'm referring to psychological symptoms (i.e., dreams, depression, anxiety)

The downers offer value too but they are too dangerous but I find myself rationalizing it.

Benzos - Makes you forget, end up taking more, potential for horrible withdrawals, long term brain plasticity changes regarding anxiety?

Pro - What if I become more relaxed in interviews and complex social situations? False - Because I can learn to improve confidence sober?

Opiates - Was it a lie that I convinced myself I was a better version of myself genuinely? More empathy, feeling satisfied, going through life more like a happy zombie and maybe I will feel better about seeking out experiencess

Also the ultimate denial - Ok so here I am using other substances responsibly, whats the harm in trying these downers recreationally again? Relax here and there. But I can't trust myself to not use it frequently so no bother even doing it right?

I ask you because I have been idealizing the idea of trying it again and sometimes it takes circumstances in life to snap to bend to that bad decision. I shouldn't so I should leave it that but the mind still tries to justify I think.

**""**Methadone Mile"" is the nickname for a stretch of road in the one of the US capitol cities. It has a hospital next to a hospital and as the same suggests, a ton of Methadone Clinics.  
   
**The setting:**  
Methadone Mile from a normal person's POV is sad, depressing, and just downright wrong. From a drug addicts perspective, It's fucking **perfection**.  It's pretty much a sanctioned, lawless part of the city where they push all the drug addicts away from residential and shopping centers. In right in the center of the *HOOD*. and **I mean the fucking hood.** Ever watch HBO's *The Wire*? That's this place. Down to the fucking corner boys screaming what drugs they have. The first time we went down there I thought to myself, *there is NO way this place is fucking real.* But it was and I was in utter shock. It's literally a mile stretch of roads **infested** with drug addicts. They're ll you have to do is ask the first person you see and you can get whatever the fuck you want. But the CRAZIEST thing? Everybody is getting high.  **PUBLICLY.** Dude, I was literally ***SMOKING CRACK*** in ***FRONT of POLICE***! Even Staties!   
During the day, between 8am-5pm there was 3 tents around the area. 2 tents are referred to ""shooting galaries"" because you can get high in them. They have volonteers handing out clean needle kits which include: *1pk long or short tipped needles, purified water, cotten, arm tye, vitamin C(breaks down crack for IV), cookers, sanitizing wipes, and antibacterial cream*.  They offer medical assistance on site and tons of narcan. If you die from an overdose there you have the worst luck in the world because it's pretty much impossible. The other tent is filled with computer/internet access for resume and job applying (Most just use it for social media) You can sit in the AC/Heat if it's too hot/cold outside, charge your phone, make coffee, eat, things like that. 

**The People:**  
Now if it wasn't obvious before or you're just interesting in finding out more about my people, most of them just fucking suck. Of course, I can't blame them it's just that of course they're drug addiction is #1 so they will do *anything* to support it. Don't get me wrong, beating people (taking their money without actually supplying them) is HIGHLY looked down upon. Your reputation out there is all you have. If you have a shit reputation, people are going to treat you according, or just not deal with you at all. You'll pretty much get black listed. There's a difference in getting more for your buck and just plain ripping people off. I've met a lot of people out there and even ran into a guy I grew up with and knew before either one of us were on drugs. I guess he's been out there for years and has a lot of pull so he spread the word I was his sister and to be treated with respect and not be messed with. He's helped me get hooked up with plugs that wont short me cause they're actual dealers and not just selling to support their habit. I've met seasoned people out there that have taken immediate liking to me just because I'm a 25 year old, and out there that's extremely young so I've had a lot of women have my back as well and just basically showed me the ropes. Everywhere has good and bad people, and the people in between. Overall though, they're all scam artist and you have to take everything with a grain of salt.

**How I ended up there:**  
Me and my boyfriend of 2 years would go down there to score drugs a month or 2 before he went back to prison is when we started spiraling downwards. He got arrested for his warrant in August 2019. I stopped going down there completely until he got out April 22nd and old habits resurfaced. Now, I was with my bf the whole time he was in prison. Money, letters, visits, lugging drugs, everything. But I was cheating on him 75% of the time with my ex of 7 years. So me and current boyfriend's relationship went down the tubes and so did both our sobriety. Well, things got extremely psychically abusive. He was already mentally/verbally abusive but things escalated. So I finally gather the courage to breakup with him and I left, and being an abusive relationship AND just burning bridges from my addiction I was cut off from everybody. My friends, family, just anybody who loved me. I was alone. For the first time since 16, *I was completely, utterly, alone.* I lived in that hellhole for a month on the street. Eventually i called my  ex bf of 7 years and he ubered me to where he was, got us a hotel room, and help detox me.

One strange thing I noticed was that this new bud made a quite a loud cracking sound as it was smoked. I have heard a cracking sound before but usually when it's a stem or seed, this made the sound on every time toke though. 

Now I'm quite a seasoned smoker, I've smoked on and off for 13 years. But after a few joints I really started tripping out. My vision was felt distorted and it felt quite hallucinogenic. I'm not denying it's possible I was just very high - but something else just didn't seem quite right. I got a little anxious about it all and went to bed. 

I'm wondering whether this weed could have been laced with something to give it the relaxing feel and would also explain the cracking sound. If it wasn't laced then it's pretty weird how I felt after it.

At various points in my life I have tried cannabis but have never really got it. A few interesting effects here and there also feelings I dont like nothing experienced ever that has made me want to use cannabis more mostly dizzy, forgetful, spaced out..... Until now.

The other day I shared some cannabis with someone i dont know and it made me feel better than anything else ever has in my life.

It started with very mild pins and needles in my feet but then that turned to a warm numbness that then slread throughout my body. I felt like i was sinking into the chair and it was enveloping me completely. My bones felt warm and like they were radiating gentle heat and the rest of my body was cotton wool. Very very relaxing i didnt fell like moving but when i did this warm feeling stayed and I had no aches or pains anywhere.

I remember thinking 'i dont ever not want to feel like this'

I dont know what type of cannabis that was and why it had the effect it did unlike other cannabis I have tried in the past and im hoping someone can help put me on the right track to research. Basically I want to find a way to get that feeling again

Was what I experienced a ""body high""? Or does it have a different name?

What are the characteristics? THC CBD that make this feeling more likely

Any strains that you can name for this feeling?

I use various drugs, I do the occasional opiate like tylenols, or oxy. Even morphine a few times. I used dxm heavily for maybe 2 years but now I cant stand downing the stuff. I use ketamine quite a bit. I do psychedelics but no where as much as I do harmful drugs. I smoke weed heavily daily but in my region weed isn't a problem because its cheap and easily accessible (and legal) I could live with smoking for the rest of my life. I however am concerned with my other drug use. 

I haven't been hardcore addicted to a drug or at least felt compulsed to use one constantly other than weed, dxm, benzo's and ketamine. I'd say the worst I've had was a half year spin with pressed benzos but now I don't even feel the pleasant effects of benzos and only save em for major panic attacks or for during a bad trip or to get rid of residual drug effects to sleep.

I can actually control my opiate use quite well and I've never used em more than 3 days in a row and that was only once. 95% of the time it's a single use and few and far between at the span of months in between uses. Mostly because they're hard to find and expensive. Heroin never appealed to me, cocaine just sucks imo and other drugs just don't really feel all that appealing. 

I use ketamine probably the most out of all the hard drugs I do. It's not daily use or even weekly. Usually I'll pick up a gram, do it all in one night or if I'm able to control myself, split it amongst a few days. Usually now tho I find myself able to put it down for a few weeks and for the latter half of 2019 didn't even do any substances except weed and some alcohol (which isn't very fun in my experience, was just for social situations) and I don't really find it that much of a problem. But as I've seen in other more extreme cases of drug abuse, the user never see's it as a problem. I'm fairly confident in my self control but I have the lingering feeling in the back of my head that maybe I'm using this mediocre self control to excuse a growing problem or something. 

I do have other hobbies and interests. Going sober wasnt that hard outside the offset, the only reason I relapsed in early 2020 was all this madness combined with becoming homeless, being stressed at school, losing relation ships and deteriorating mental health and worsening mental illnesses.

I guess what the tdlr would be is how far do you have to be gone to need smt like narcotics anonymous, should I maybe fix it before it becomes a problem? Or is learning better self control and moderation an option? 

I see some of the worst stories on this sub and in my city and it just makes my situation seem tame or somehow like lucky if that make sense. seeing hardcore heroin addicts and fentanyl users post stories of their ridiculous doses that don't even get them high anymore, all of it makes me think that I'm not doing so bad after all.

Normally I’d be working out if I felt this way but these last few days I can’t even get myself out of bed to make a proper meal. I did 15 push-ups to see if maybe I’d get some endorphins going, nothing. The only thing I’ve been able to force myself to do is things I know I absolutely have to to keep up appearances. It’s despicable.

I write this in case I fall ill to a stroke, become left a vegetable state, have died, or have no more mental control over myself. I imagine most everyone close to me will be incredibly sad. But. I knew what Fate lay ahead of me. Just know though that the end result of what is going to happen to me is going to happen to everyone. To you, to you loved ones, even to your enemies. 

While the ceasing of my existence might fall ill on family and friends, let me ask you this. Did the drugs completely terrorize my existence my whole life until death, or did I enjoy the FUCK of out being high, all strings attached. 

I am The Man who lived his life to the fullest in his own way in what way he saw fit. 

My dad would argue immediately that I did not live life to the fullest and instead was handicapped by my addiction. Then you do not understand the joy that I felt at the release of a needle. And as awful as that sounds to you, to me it leaves a different memory. An escape from a harsh world. And escape from a harsh mind. And escape from unhappiness. Every fucking time. 

I don’t know if I would ever change my life except, maybe losing the ones I love. But. Do not judge me too harshly. In what Way are you better? Do you not in fact condone death fully, where it made me completely miserable every day? Play fake fucking pretend cookie cutter shit life everyday, making sure the fucking bed is made, your entire life in fucking order while a small girl is being forced to do unthinkable things to another human being, but don’t fucking let those thoughts in. Those thoughts could ruin a whole fucking hour of your life before your mom called, and then after a couple minutes of drawling on about your fucking Ficus, that girl being raped is long out of *your* existence. But she’s still there. She’ll die too eventually in that state. 

Im no fucking better. I’m no fucking hero. But that’s what I’m saying. Your horse is fucking high bro. 

“Addict?”

Fucking loser. Just quit. Just stop. It’s easy. “I tried it once, put it down like it was nothing” Or even better. “I never even tried it, not once”. Those people live in a fucking different reality than me, one where the most happiness you ever felt came from a lover 27 years ago that you still think about and master bate to every so often with your husband snoring beside you. 

Death will come to you one day And I believe that you will ultimately regret that you did not do more in life no matter how much you actually did. One day you will wake up, inevitably , and it will be like you were just born yesterday, but you’re actually leaving that same day. Life will feel like it happened so fast. 

But see, I did not overlook death, or run away from it. I lived every day terrified of the nothingness that would come to greet me, not as a friend, but as a sworn enemy. I love my brain, all in all. I love getting fucked up. 

Id even say I lived every day to the fullest as I saw fit. Once again, Death comes for us all. I knew that every day o was alive and was tortured by it. This was my escape. 

 I love you all very much. I wish I had better ways to show it because it truly filled my heart and my body and my mind and my thoughts all the time just how much I loved you all.

New to this subreddit and didn't know where else to go, so, if you know of a better sub to recommend, please do. I'm a recently recovering alcoholic and a former coke/crack, heroin, and meth addict (for context: been sober off of all hard shit for almost 3 years now and had my last drink a month ago) that had a really rough day today, emotionally, and wanted something to take the edge off without relapsing (don't judge me.) I happened to have stumbled across my little brother's old prescription bottle of bupropion xl 150 mg and decided to do a little fondling around around on the ol googly, to see if it did anything. Turns out it's considered the ""poor man's cocaine"" and gives you a similar euphoria as meth only less intense, so I figured ""eh, what the hell? Why not?"" I crushed up 3 of them and snorted em down in a few minutes (burns like hell just FYI, wouldn't recommend) and immediately my nose and surrounding face area went almost completely numb and my whole head space had completely changed to almost an intensely insta-high which put me in panic mode, given, I've OD'd five times in the past and am fearful that I've done too much. I am extremely spracked atm and can't find anybody on the googler with firsthand experience and have no idea what to expect, how long it's going to last, or if I'm in trouble.

Basically I’ve sent y’all a couple of entries, all them slam poetry, fucking just writings, fucking whatever. Some of you expressed interest in more, and some of you heathens told me to write a book. Well, I’m fucking high that I started it, and this is Ch.1. I’m sending ch.2 shortly. 

Be forewarned. It’s fucked. 

Potential name-
“My Story- Sorry Dad”
“A Montage of my Addiction” question mark?

Ch 1 - Pushing the Browns back into the Super Bowl

I didn’t *really* want him to fuck me in the ass. 
I mean, I’d be lying if I said my dick didn’t slightly tingle when his man parts were pushed against my shitter. 

But, 1. I was fucking high, like actually really high (which I’ll explain the levels later). But It’d been a month since I’d used, which was fucking light years in the recent times. So, ya, was absolutely *up*. A mother fucking snake could manifest into a flesh light at that point if I squinted my eyes in a certain way, just one long ass squishy fuck-hole I was trying my damndest to reach the end of. 

And 2. I *reaaaaaally* wanted that little bit dope that I knew came at the end of his fountain of milky cum. 

Now, let’s pause and take in this scene. 

See, I try to be understanding to the fact that you, the reader, a slightly “normal” human being, are not *completely* desensitized to the literal hell I’ve lived in for eight years. And,

(Rant)^*1

When I say normal, everyone’s fucking *favorite* thing to say is “What *isssss* normal anyway?” 

Like it was the deepest thought to ever be fucking said, 

like it literally hadn’t been said millions of times over the course of the entirety of human beings being able to put simple thoughts together into understandable sentences to one another. 

Literally, 

the dad caveman that was with his family, talking to his son about how he was *special*, but in a brief moment of what he thought was genius, said, trying to console his weird mutated son about his three penises and ten nipples,

“What isssss normal anyway?” Said in a series of unintelligible grunts. 

Obviously the dad felt very pleased with himself. 

That was also partly cause he took a fat shit in the middle of the conversation, squatting at the long “isssss” and standing back up at the “normal anyway”.

To be more clear, it went like this. 

What (squat-plooooooohp) *issssss* (stands), normal anyway (checks behind him, nodding approvingly). 

Even then. 

Even fucking back then, the first time it was said, 

That shit was kiddie pool deep. You couldn’t even drown yourself in that small puddle of ingenuity if your fucking life depended on...you, dying?

Look, all I fucking  mean is, 

is that normal is a polar opposite to waiting for an enlarged dopamine dick to enter your lonely backside cave so you can get high and jack off for the next 20 hours, skipping work, avoiding phone calls, and being a general degenerate. 

So, if we’re not clear, fuck you. 

(We’re back)

...and, if I don’t pause, I might potentially lose another reader, bringing total audience from 0 to 0. 

When he put his feeling extension into my sweet sweet hole of glory, for a second it was...almost nice. 

I was surprised. 

It felt slightly uncomfortable having those complex formation of atoms slide into me, 

like My asshole was a guy who’d been living alone for the past 28 years, and suddenly rent goes up, So you gotta get a roommate, and he’s alright, but he talks a lot, and sometimes you just really wanna be alone,  but you feel like you have to be polite during the second hearing of how he burned his foot with pizza (fucking idiot), and you hint that you’ve heard the story before by finishing literally every fucking sentence with a half hearted chuckle, but he’s literally fucking stupid and just stands there In the kitchen unwanted, but there anyway while you boil your water in a pot for your ramen like a fucking communist heathen from North Korea. 

Just kidding, North Koreans don’t get to eat. 

That was his “Cyclops Gazer” in my pink, lush Digested Food Exit. 

It just didn’t belong bro. 

Then it went from slightly not a good time to fucking oh my god no fuck awful. 

So there’s this point in your Dark Tunnel where, I’m guessing, there’s a circular type muscle that you can slice your poop with by clenching that said muscle. It is also the true entrance into your large intestine. 

The gays tell me this is what you relax, and overtime is becomes as easy as blinking, and is super super enjoyable, to the point where you can literally *climax* getting fucked in your ass. 

This being the second time anything had explored that Great Unknown, first time being nearly blackout drunk with a micro penis, I had absolutely no idea what mixture of thoughts and willpower could relax that muscle when literally all I felt was pain.  

I don’t know if your Gaping Gapeness has ever forgotten how big your Smelly Reliever actually was, and formed a poop that was much too large to exit, and it felt like a nasty gremlin was ripping your butt cheeks apart with bare hands while laughing, but if you know what I’m talking about, you understand that 30 seconds of intense pain, followed by a throbbing pelvic bone, literal tears welling in your eyes. 

It felt a lot like that in reverse, except I was so tense cause of all the stimulants I’d slipped into my veins, and i literally had no control of the shard of shit, because someone else was wielding it like a 13th century master knight, pulverizing it’s enemy, searching for its delightful finish, inside my Black Loneliness. 

It hurt. 

I said stop, he was suddenly deaf, blah blah blah. 

Look, I really fucking wanted that dope. 

In one of my many alcoholic episodes, I became fervently opposed to the taste of any alcohol, beer wine and liquor. Made me gag at the literal thought of it. Mainly because at the time I was fucking slamming these hot beers I’d stolen from Walmart, hot because I didn’t have money for a cooler and ice, and I *had* to be drunk to sell fireworks. Had to be. I threw up countless times. Made being an alcoholic very difficult.

But, I learned a trick from it, cause I’m a smart mother fucker. 

“A moment of shittiness for something good is worth the shitiness”

Simple, but *mostly* true, when the outcome doesn’t lead to you getting more drugs by getting fucked in the ass. 

I overcame the gag at the thought of the smell of Sunset Blush box wine by those words, thinking as I chugged, closing my nostrils with the free hand,

“No matter what, *as long as you keep doing something*, it will eventually be finished, no matter what it is.”

No matter how hard the job, how long the wait, fucking anything, you start something, and it will eventually be done. Shitty food, hot beer, eating literal shit? Idk I never got that far but probably not honestly. That’s disgusting. 

But became something of a mantra in my life the more fucked up things became. I was facing horrible, hard, decisions every day, and I kept telling myself, 

“Getting fucked in the ass is worth a night of fun”

Right? 

Not you?

Well. 

Let me put it to you this way. 

If it wasn’t, to me,

 if it wasn’t worth the thing I was trying to get, then why in the fuck would I literally do almost physically anything for those 12-48 hours of stim-fap^*2 every. Fucking. Time. 

I’d lose any job over it.  

I’d lose the love of my life over it. 

I’d live in my car over it. 

It’s that fucking good man. 

I’m not even sure if I like dick, but his painful hip thrusts were worth my delayed release later. 

Part of me fears the things I’ll soon lose from that dopamine escape. 

Almost. 

Then the part of my brain that protects me from any negative or bad thought so that I don’t have to feel true emotion and change as a human being kicks in, mutes all thoughts, 

I’m a fucking robot again. 

I think only for the day. I only think about the rush. It’s never enough. I need more. I need another shot before this game of Halo. Doesn’t matter that it makes me worse, I simply enjoy existence more. I’m interested in the matter in front of me, interested in myself and my thoughts, my feelings, which are always pleasant now. I am a conversational master, high. No one suspects that doesn’t know me. The ones that do only suspect because I’m not a sad puddle of depression that plagues my sober days. 

That 20 hours of jacking off after getting fucked,

it was worth it. 

No ragrets. 

Enjoy my montage of my addiction.

I just wish my “friend” never introduced me to the thought of weed, granted I do more than enough research, but if you do, you know the euphoria you get from reading stories about people doing drugs before you’ve even touched a substance.

Should we just plan to stay inside? Would walking to a nearby river or park be okay if we’re feeling like it sounds nice? If we start feeling like things are headed in a bad direction would smoking some weed help?

I had about a 70mg bump bc I thought my tolerance would be fairly low (I hadn’t had any for about 8 days) so I have the bump and I get up from playing xbox and go down to my bed to vibe but after waiting about 30 minutes, nothing hits me. So I crack out the k again and made myself two bumps of about 140mg each and snorted them both in different nostrils. Wait another 30 minutes, and I start feeling the effects properly now, getting glued to my bed and such, but something in my brain really wanted to get to the k hole, (which I now realise was pretty futile considering it prolly wasn’t actually pure k) so I get up shakily and cut myself a massive line(this is after telling myself and my friend that I won’t have any more), like maybe 400mg and snort half and see how I go. Then basically as soon as I snort the half, I feel like I need to have the other half, so I give it ten ish minutes and have the other half. Then I start going properly off. I pour out the rest of the bag with us prolly like another 400mg and snort all of it in one go, (bearing in mind this bag was supposed to last me at least a couple weeks). And then I just start going full on, snorting the remainder off my card, off the fiver, off the table and then I realise that I’ve split some on my carpet so I get down on my knees and snort the little bits out of my carpet. Then I start pacing back and forth really shaky and look for more k (luckily I didn’t find any so I didn’t end up taking a stupid stupid amount) the thing that I’m questioning is am I addictive or was it just a consequence of having too much ket on me at one time,  I’m also really pissed off bc I wasted so much ket and didn’t even get hole off it bc it just ended up not going to my nasal cavity and just going into my mouth. I’m pretty much through the high now, on the comedown and I have no urge whatsoever to have more ket or buy more for a while, just wondering what’s the go from here. Thanks! :) 

Btw it wasn’t a bad experience at all, I loved it, just a bit worried about how completely devoured I was with doing ket, luckily I didn’t end up hurting myself of having a bad time but I’ll definitely be more careful in the future in regards to storing my ket away from me while I’m on it",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,697591,public,confidence,self,I’m not sure what happened last night on ket (sorry if this is dumb long),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hzuzn6/im_not_sure_what_happened_last_night_on_ket_sorry/,no_ads,0.0,1596029542.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And 4 days ago one of my friends was having a birthday party. And then we found out that another friend was home alone for a week so we were going to have a party for him. And I thought that this was the perfect opportunity to try LSD for the first time. So I bought 1 tab of acid and one ecstasy pill for another day and one of my friend wanted to try ecstasy for the first time so he also bought an ecstasy pill.
So we get to my friends house and we wait for everyone to come over. The dealer said that the tab was a double dose so I only took half of it and my “ecstasy friend” took half of the ecstasy just to be safe.
Then I kind of forgot that I had taken the tab for a wile and just talked with my and nothing out of the order nary happened.And no one of my friends hav taken LSD so they didn’t know exactly what to do if I have a bad trip but there was 2 of my friends that had done a little research about LSD and that was my trip sitter and my “ecstasy friend”. So after a wile (don’t really know how long after I took it because my time presentation was all fucked up) I started to noticed that colors started to become more vibrant and bright, and there was a lot of colorful things on the walls so I started to explore the apartment a little. Then my friend that was supposed to be my trip sitter had to go (don’t remember why tho) but he promised that he was going to come back in half an hour. I wasn’t to happy about it but I knew that that my “ecstasy friend” could take care of me because he barely felt the ecstasy so he took the other half but he was still almost sober. So I hade a good time hanging out with my friends,dancing and listening to music . But then I started to se the walls kind of breathing so nothing insane, but I decided I to lay down and take it easy for a wile. Then my “ecstasy friend” came in and checked on me but he forgot to close the door after him. And my other friends was watching the 2 pac movie on Netflix and they hade really loud speakers and I guess they where at the scene where 2 pac got killed. So I hear the gunshots and I freak out and start hyperventilating but my “ecstasy friend” calmed me down and made my other friends turn down the volume. So at this point I was kind of freaked out so I called my “trip sitter” that I thought Had bin gone for many hours by this point but he had really just been gone for half an hour. 

And this is when the night gets weird. so my “trip sitter” told me that he and another one of my friends was on there way to a mutual friends house because it had been a little party there so they had been drinking a bit. And one of my long time male friend (the male part is going to be important later) ho was there was standing on the balcony parapet and tried to jump of so the other people at the party had to throw him down from there and get him inside. So I got worried and asked why he would do something like that and what exactly had happened, but I didn’t get a clear answer because my “trip sitter” didn’t really know ether, but he said they were going to go and get my “suicidal friend” out of there and take care of him and then they would go back to our party. And I didn’t tell the rest of my friends that I knew what had happened and I’m not really sure why but I was probably distracted when the trip got more intense.

After that conversation I started to se things kind of breathing and I started to forget about that hole situation about my “suicidal friend”. So I walked around looking at different things around the house and was trying my hardest to describe what I was seeing to my friends but I didn’t really know how to.

Then maybe 1 hour after I talked to my “trip sitter” he called his girlfriend, so I heard that it was him and told her everything that had happened so she told the rest of our party what had happened with my “suicidal friend”. And at this point I was tripping pretty hard and I wanted to meet my “trip sitter” but I hade lost my phone and couldn’t find it so I told one of my friends at the party to call my “trip sitter” and ask where he was. By then my “trip sitter” and my Luther friend had taken my “suicidal friend” away from the other party and to a park nearby so I took  friend with me out to meet them.

And the first thing I did when I came out was run, and i remember that it felt amazing. And I didn’t really get how serious the situation was until I saw my “suicidal friend”. His t-shirt was ripped apart, he had blood on his knuckles and some running down his neck(but no serious injuries). Then when I went to say hello to him and I noticed that he was very drunk so he could barely stand or talk. I didn’t ask him what had happened, but I waited until I could speak to my “trip sitter” what had happened to him. And he said that my “suicidal friend had punched are mutual friends girlfriend and he also tried to jump down from the balcony. And when he said that I was in disbelief, I mean I have known him for many years and never thought that he would do something stupid shit like this. 

And I noticed he was acting weird and not just that he was drunk, I mean I have seen him drunk before. So we decided to take him back to the party so I went in and my “trip sitter” waited outside and talked to my friend ho had the party at her house on the phone, so my “trip sitter” tried to get the “party host” to let my “suicidal friend” inside. But my “suicidal friend” kept screaming that he was going to kill himself so another friend of ours took him home. 

And then just a few moments later my “trip sitter” had to go home. And that’s when the trip really started. Faces looked really weird and started to morf and it was super cool until I looked in my camera and I saw my face and it was like symmetrical and started to fold in on itself and that really freaked me out because I hade totally forgot that I was on LSD at this point. So I really start to trip hard so I walk from room to room and didn’t stay in one place weary long. And I remember one thing very clearly and it was when I was laying in a bed and it felt like I was in a boat. Then me and my “ecstasy friends” girlfriend was in the couch watching Venom and not only was the movie fucking terrifying for me but I also forgot ho I was, where I was and what I was doing there. And I didn’t want to ask anyone for some reason but I finally remembered ho I was again. But then I didn’t understand what anyone was saying on the TV, it sounded like it was playing backwards.

I am 17, have been doing drugs since i was 13. I won't go into too much detail, but I also started doing xans and other benzos (mainly valium) this time. I was always somewhat afraid of pills so I never took much. Then I became a junkie by 14 and well...you can imagine the rest.

Anyways, whenever I don't have some hash lying around I usually resort to xans since my mom is prescribed. I should probably note that I have severe depression and am prescribed 100mg of Zoloft a day, Pequit, Zylex and Depril. Can't really bother to google the chemical names since it's 9 in the morning and i haven't slept all night. A month or so back, I took 10mg of xans to bar out. Before this I would take 5mg at a time when I wanted. Surprisingly the 10mg did jack shit. I chalked it up to tolerance and gave the xans a break. After a few weeks, I did 10mg again. Same result. Then again after a few weeks (a month or so ago would be the last time)...and well..nada. Notto say that I am fond of benzos, this is very well a blessing in disguise, but I would still like to know if something is wrong with me.

Have you ever wondered why addicts crave drugs? Why drug cravings persist even after long periods of abstinence? Or whether 'wanting' drugs (drug craving) is attributable to ‘liking’ drugs (to the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs)? Or possibly due to external components altogether?

We're 4 Canadian neuroscientists reviewing news, events and scholarly publications from this week in neuroscience and beyond! In each 'NeuroDrugs' stream, we review classics in the field of addiction neuroscience, as well as newly published articles on a weekly basis.

Here's our recent commentary / journal club-esque conversation reviewing the classic addiction research article that began the 'wanting/liking' dichotomy that researchers are still investigating to this day. Titled ""The neural basis of drug craving: An incentive-sensitization theory of addiction"", Terry E. Robinson &amp; Kent C. Berridge present a bio-psychological theory of drug addiction, the ‘Incentive-Sensitization Theory’. The incentive-sensitization theory of addiction posits the following. 1. Addictive drugs enhance dopamine transmission in brain reward regions 2. A major psychological function of this neural system is to attribute ‘incentive salience’ to the perception and mental representation of events associated with activation of the system (drug associated cues and stimuli). 3. In some individuals the repeated use of addictive drugs produces adaptations in this system, rendering it increasingly and perhaps permanently, hypersensitive (‘sensitized’) to drugs and drug-associated stimuli. This is ultimately a learning &amp; memory based effect.

what is a good dose, not super light, but definitely not super extreme? i've seen a lot of people say 300/300 but I am skeptical as I have never done DXM or combined with DPH and that is essentially 2 times the dose as my only other experience

i'm 19 , 5'11 , but i'm only about 120 pounds.

Fortunately, I do not faint with my symptoms, but I do get pretty dizzy sometimes and have stomach/abdominal pain.

My doctor has seen a couple of dozen Dysautonomia/POTS patients. The medical community in general isn't quite sure what causes it. Some get it in their teenage years and others like me (37 year old male) get it in their 20's or 30's. I do have pretty bad sleep apnea, but they don't think it is related.

BACKSTORY

&amp;#x200B;

I have finally got a girlfriend, and I am so happy. I am 22 years old and ever since I was 12 it has been my only wish in life, to love and to be loved. And after many rejections I have finally found one that wants me for who I am. She is very experiensed when it comes to drugs and has tried most stuff, and unfortunately got stuck on heroin when she was 16, she's had a rough childhood and been with a lot of the wrong people, but she is a wonderful person. Anyway she is off of it now and trying to get her grades back in school and make something of herself and I am currently laid off due to corona. I work at an oil-rig in Norway, normally. 

Last december I was asked by a close friend if I could fix mdma for him, which I reluctantly did, I hit up another close friend who knows people and he agreed to help me if I came along for the ride. We went out to met up with a dealer and got 2 grams, one for my friends brother and one half for him, the rest for me as a payment. My friend I went on this meet with told me while driving him home with the stuff that, ""Dude, If you have any goals in life, achieve them before you try md. Cause nothing will ever feel better."". So I said to myself, fine, I have two goals in my life, 1: Achieve an offshore contract at an oilrig. (this is a rare and very high-paying job), or 2: To find a girlfriend.

Well, In January I started my education for offshore work, and got a job in the same sector already in febuary, not the type of contract I was looking for, but definitely a good first step. I worked a few rotations but got laid off and sent home due to corona in march, during which time I had started seing a girl, I met her when I first came home from Norway and we had been talking a lot during my first vacation. However, due to some very rude friends talking shit behind my back, that girl slowly lost her interest and eventually wrote that she sees me as just a friend. A week after that I got laid off work. 

I hit a real low. I got really depressed and started skipping days at the gym, eating less and just generally feeling like shit. 

Fortunately, I have one friend that happened to know a girl who was just in the same scenario, and he set me up to join him at her midsummer party, during which I had my first kiss with this girl, a week later we met up at her appartment, me my pal, her and my pals gf and drank and had a good time. When it was time to go, she asked me if I couldnt stay the night and I did. And lost my virginity aswell. 

After that night we have seen eachother every weekend and as many weekdays as we could until now. Two weeks ago when she was blackout drunk she confessed to me that she loved me, to which I was dumbfounded. I have been rejected and hurt so many times and NEVER had any good luck in love, so I have been extremely careful not to fall in love with this girl, but she already was...

Now, Friday the 24th of July 2020. We had planned to take MDMA, that md I had at home, and we bought some E just to be sure. We had made eachother a promise earlier in the relation, she gets to take my MD virginity, and I get to take her anal virginity. Well. I had only two conditions in which I could take MD. We were lying on my couch snuggling face to face when I told her about them, and I felt the anxiety welling up within me after telling the first condition, but I told her the second. I said ""And the second condition that I can take mdma is... when I have a girlfriend... Do I?""

To which she answered yes, and I burst out in tears, because I never thought this day would be real. I thought I would never find this girl, but here she was, in my arms, looking into my eyes, wanting me and nothing else. 

&amp;#x200B;

TRIPREPORT

&amp;#x200B;

after even more cuddling we took the mdma. It seemed that due to its age it may have lost some of its potency. We popped one cap each containing 245mg mdma each. We waited on the couch for roughly one hour before she decided she would pop one e aswell. I wasnt really sure, but I figured she knew better what to expect from this drug and I have taken a half-assed dose before and gotten really mad about it, so I popped one aswell. These were 260mg blue redbulls if I remember correctly. And DAMN, they were some good e allright. After 20 minutes I was blasting away, and she pulled me up from the sofa and we started dancing around. She queued songs on spotify from shpongle, neelix, 1200mcg, and a couple of similars, she is rather seasoned with mdma, but damn. I was haveing the time of my life. And she just grew prettier and prettier the more time went, the MDMA slowly released all the fears of rejection and all barriers I had put up and I realised that I love this Girl, I had a hunch before that I feel somethin for her, but this was it, All it tok was for a substanse to tear dowm my walls and there she were. After rougly an hour we popped the last one, we split one orange FCB and it was off the rails. I was hallucinating and talking like never before. I told her about my fears, my past, how afraid I was that she wouldnt like me for who I am, everything just came so easy I even dared to tell her about my sexual desires, and she is the only person who has ever gotten to know this, and I have been so afraid of letting anyone know about that for all my life but she seemed fine with it, she even told me her own. And she told me that she couldnt believe I was single before her. she told me that she isnt used to guys being so nice to her, we kept sweet-talking eachother, but we meant every word. Her face changed to different faces everytime I blinked, once it was a famous celebrity she had mentioned, once just some random woman, and many more I cant remember. One time, when she opened her right eye, I saw three cigarettes sticking out of it, and they followed her eyemovements even. It was insane. We continued to talk and touch eachothers for hours and then we decided we were going to have sex, it never came to that, but I got to half undressing her leaving her in her oversized sweater and a hairband, but she was the cutest thing I have ever seen. I was going to get some lube and when I got back to the sofa she was standing in doggy, facing me looking at me with the cutest eyes I had ever seen. I will never forget that image in my head. Fuck, I love her soooo much! 

sorry about getting so in detail about that, I just.. I love to share my experiences, but this really is something that can only be shared on the internet. 

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah. I have finally found the one, and I love her sooo much. And, MDMA is fking amazing... good damn. It feels like I had a highly pressurised tank with all my anxieties and fears for this girl and the MDMA just flipped the vent and all the pressure in the tank just went away and I finally feel, calm and accepted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank anyone for reading. I wish I could tell this to my friends, but they'd be jealous, or my parents, but they'd dislike it for the drugs.

But it's pill that you swaller or snort .. not crystal or anything like that! Anyways i started in march and i'm still on it today ... I do this every two or tree days if not i'm really depressive.

He is gay and has slipped into the chemsex scene where he smokes a lot of meth and takes G. His high income and the fact he can work from home helps fund his addiction to meth and g.

I just visited his house and he has ripped off all the TVs in his house, it’s a complete mess. He keeps telling me his neighbours are spying on him and the walls are telling him.

The other day he took a lethal dose of G and was rushed to hospital.

I honestly don't know how to help him or who to talk to. I have spoken to him countless of times to quit the meth or at least taper it down but he always seems to have more.

I don't know his family so I can not contact them either..

Mark and I have been friends since the mid-‘70s, he and his fiendish extended family introduced me to partying, its rituals &amp; after-effects, an innocent 25 yr old dumped into the sludge pit, never the same.

We both had our moments, mine after an ill-advised dip into blow, luckily I’m a lightweight so my body shut me down quick. Mark’s tougher, or more determined, I never saw someone throw himself in so enthusiastically. 

He quit everything, mostly drinking, for 30yrs, but fast forward to the age of Covid and he’s in rehab (physical), complete collapse — a combination of Ambien, one of those fucken’ pams, lorazepam I think, something called Soma (no joke) oxys and booze.

It’s the *combination* that has me sick … the cross-addiction is really dangerous, too many interactions. Luckily he’s strong like horse, his vitals were excellent going in, and he’s now responsive and conversational.

Rehab won’t let me visit because of the 'Ronas, but within 30 days he'll be out and we have to talk. My first instinct is to bring an indoor ball bat with nails banged through it and start swinging, also my sister says I can’t make it all about me (hee!) so those are out.

I’ll start off by letting you know a little about myself. I’m a 23 year old male. I’m still in school (due to issues unrelated to drug use). I have had ADHD for as long as I can remember. I just recently got off of adderall (prescription) after about 9 or 10 years, by my request. I have always felt like I was trying to self-stimulate with my adhd and that’s probably where a lot of my behaviors stem from, among genetic predispositions to substance abuse.

I’ve often found myself realizing that most things I do nowadays revolve around the next high or the next rush of endorphins. Whether it’s weed, alcohol, dxm, shrooms, acid, or even sex/ejaculation, I feel like I’m always craving something to give me that rush. In terms of activities that give me this “rush”, I do them whenever I can, like skiing, jet skiing, snowmobiling, wakeboarding, etc. However, a lot of that seems to be put off as there are quicker and more easy alternatives to get me that rush. 

I drink alcohol and smoke weed a lot. Everyday for weed, like 4-5 days a week for alcohol. I also have done dxm every few weeks/months for years now, with a few larger breaks. Those are what I would consider the ones I do semi-normally. I really get after it, too. I don’t smoke a ton quantity-wise, but I do drink a hefty amount of alcohol. I don’t find myself to be addicted to anything, but I sure crave it a lot. I mean that in the way that I can go a few days without smoking weed, and I can have a beer or two and stop, no problem. 

But what worries me is that my mind doesn’t seem to discriminate. I quit nicotine last year and weed is what I used to quell the cravings. Essentially, still doing drugs all the time, but supposedly a “less harmful” one. 

SO, the question here is: what is going on with me? Is this normal? Is it just that I have an addictive personality? Am I overthinking all of this? 

TLDR: I engage in many behaviors to feel a “rush”, and I don’t know if that should be a warning sign or if maybe I’m just a normal guy who likes drugs and sex a lot.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,697497,public,confidence,self,Why am I always chasing the next rush?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hzo2ob/why_am_i_always_chasing_the_next_rush/,no_ads,0.0,1596002479.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are days like that, when we wish we could go back.Realize how lucky we were. Of the treasure we held in our hands. I am one of those who believe in true love once, and only once in a lifetime.   
The red thread which despite all the trials of life and even before these trials remains there, is there, and will be eternally. Like an indescribable destiny.But unfortunately with or without the involvement of drugs, it is arduous to follow this thread, this treasure. Some souls are created to meet. And who can no longer live without the other.A bit like twins that have been torn from each other and therefore feel incomplete. For ever.  


And what a paradox.On one hand, I discovered an unknown world by sharing this drug, this extraordinary proximity, out of time, out of the world with my soul mate. And on the other hand, this experience devastated us.A destruction in which I can no longer find hope.Like a profound change in the soul itself.Without return.How sad.This feeling represent the feeling of having ruined everything.Lost the most magnificent thing in the world.Absolute love ne'er discovered beforehand.And we slowly observed settling, destroying itself.Vanish.Sometimes these pure and sincere and extraordinary memories of love, these treasures, impose me the will to move on.Not to ruin me.To keep hope. And then, sometimes comes the nights when the memories of this love, of these experiences, of these moments are so strong in me that I experience them living and wanting to come out of me and be born from my chest mutilating it apart. In these moments I behold the lack of hope, the lack of meaning of what I'm trying to accomplish.Because I am doing it for us. For my past love and for me. But my dear love, he is no longer there, he has gone on a crusade of which I come to be no longer a part and of which I no longer represent the slightest thing. This red thread, it only connects me to myself and my memories of a loved ghost. In those moments. I want to crack. Abandon everything. How far I have come to get out. In those moments, I would like letting myself die of drugs until I no longer feel. To represent nothing more than a ghost. The similar ghost that I'm chasing and that merely exists through my memories of a past love and drug addiction.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,697486,public,confidence,self,I relapsed after so much accomplishment and effort over the recent year,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hznmll/i_relapsed_after_so_much_accomplishment_and/,no_ads,0.0,1596000986.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'd like to start this off by saying I have done my fair share in the past and am not speaking from a place of complete ignorance. Also, I've looked up a bit on hallucinogen abuse and besides self-admitted rehab places I couldn't find help on how exactly to go about this situation. I live thousands of miles away from him and cannot confront him in person, we mostly text.

My friend is a 24/7 pot smoker and has been doing a lot of LSD, K, and DMT. He has had severe depression issues and mild addiction issues in the past. The more concerning parts of this usually happen after DMT or K.

Three weeks ago my friend hit me up and told me about how he saw an Indian Goddess (Kali), I said that was really cool and he told me I didn't understand, and that she was really there. We have had a high school friend who developed severe psychosis after a few trips and so I told him to be mindful of what he really believes when tripping. He then asked me if I believed in aliens, I said I believe there is life somewhere out there but I don't believe in advanced beings visiting Earth. He dropped the conversation. 

We had some pretty normal convos after this, played a couple games together. He mentioned getting into conspiracy theories lately, we talked mostly about Jefferey Epstein and such which I find some credibility in, I got the feeling he was reading more 'out there' theories but he never brought them up.

A couple days ago he said he watched a video on the Annunaki and then took K and ended up speaking to Extraterrestrials. He then said that UFOs were trending the next morning on Twitter. The tone of what he said sounds like he was trying to offer me proof that aliens exist and that they are talking to him. I told him I believed it was the drugs and his mindset that produced the aliens. He dropped the conversation again. 

I have been getting worried, so I reached out and asked him what good seeing these things are doing for him. He responded saying that they bring the best things, that he is going to show me the light, when the time is right. 

At this point I'm very concerned, I told him he is sounding crazy and I'm worried about him. He said 'they just want you to think I'm crazy that's why i said when the time is right'. He then followed by saying this is the first time in years he as been happy and believed in himself. 

I need help on what to do and say to him. I feel like he's in a state of manic psychosis, am I wrong about that? He has been in therapy for a while now, afaik he has not spoken to his therapist about this and likely won't as he has been sent to in-patient care before and will do anything to avoid being sent back. He lives with family and I don't believe is in immediate danger to himself or others.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,697476,public,confidence,self,Need help with my friend (Hallucinogens),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hzmq65/need_help_with_my_friend_hallucinogens/,no_ads,0.0,1595998101.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So first of all, some info about my younger brother. He just turned 18 a couple weeks ago. Eventhough he is a little young to be doing any drugs he has experimented with some. He has tried LSD, shrooms, 2-cb, ketamine, MDMA and ofcourse weed and alcohol. From what he's told me he seems like he is careful with these substances and seems like a responsible user as far as that goes.

A couple of weeks ago we had dinner together at my place. As kids we were really close but since i moved out last year we didn't really see eachother that often. 

Over dinner we had some beers and after dinner we were playing some video games like we always used to. I instantly felt that connection again and we had a ton of fun. We started to talk about our experiences with drugs and such. He told me he wanted to try out cocaine at some point and i told him about my experiences. They were mostly fun but i told him that its really easy to form a habbit with it. At that point i remembered that i still had some left and decided that this setting would be a good and relatively safe enviroment for him to try it.

We both did 1 line and instantly started to feel it. As you can expect the conversation started flowing even better. It was a really interesting bonding experience and It's a really nice memory.

yesterday though he asked me if i could get him some for a party he is going to. He wants to split 1 gram with a friend of his at this party to try it in a different setting, but i dont know if i should buy it for him. Am i an irresponsible older brother if i do?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR;

Younger brother (18) and me (21) had a really great bonding experience with some drinks and some lines of coke. Now he would like to try it in a party setting but im not sure if i should buy him any since its a risky substance.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,697471,public,confidence,self,Buying Cocaine for my younger brother,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hzmexn/buying_cocaine_for_my_younger_brother/,no_ads,0.0,1595997135.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were about 9 of us just chilling over at my friends house one Friday night, me and most of others were on MD and smoking a fair few doobs. We set up a tent, made some sick ass blanket forts, got some awesome lights and visuals on the go and my one mate was mixing on his decks. Perfect set up for a sick roll. 

Here comes Tom. If I remember correctly Tom just sorta appeared on the sofa one day and just never left. Never asked why and no one ever questioned it. He just claimed it as his own and joined in on the whacky drug taking antics. 

Anyway, Tom didn't want to do any MD as he had only recently done some at a rave, so instead he got himself some Ket. After we took our bombs and slowly began to come up Tom decided to set up a few lines on the side. We were loving life doing the usual Md shit, rubbing our skin, looking at the visuals, dancing our asses off to some DnB and looking higher than giraffes pushy.

Tom took his first 2 lines and joined us. In our drug fueled fun we didn't notice how much he was taking after those initial lines. He was starting get really ketty when dancing and just full on k-holed in the middle of the floor. 

Now we're all pinging our nuts off and feeling completely content and to be completely honest I don't think anyone could be fucked with moving Tom the sofa guy from the middle of the floor. It just seemed easier to wait until he came back from the depths of fucking mordor.

So instead of moving him we just sorta left him there and over the next hour he slowly morphed into the furniture and we were stepping and dancing over him. To be honest at one point im sure we forgot he existed. Now if someone had walked in it would look the most meth head game of buckaroo ever. Either way we didn't care.

We rolled a few doobs and stopped the music to go outside and smoke them when Tom the sofa guy rose from the dead, looked me dead in the eyes and shouted 'Call me Dr. Wobble!'.

Not really sure where Tom is now, for all I know he's probably still living on that sofa getting off his bonce every weekend. But thank you Tom for giving birth to a character we still use to this day at festivals.

I went home and in my infinite wisdom thought it would be a good idea to carry it on. My mrs at the time was proper pissed off I was on it still so I thought the best thing I can do was to hide out in the back office, play PS4 (dead by daylight) and sniff the shit I had. Fast forward 26 hours (all of which was spent playing the game and getting wasted) I thought I should try face the real world (4days in at this point) that’s when it all started going to shit.

I could hear the Dead by daylight stalk theme tune everywhere... in my phone... the tv.. everything...  on some level I knew this wasn’t real so decided to distract myself watching some you tube.. this is where it gets really weird. In every video I watched I could see Dead by daylight being played in the background. I looked at my saved pics and videos on my phone, they’d also changed to show dead by daylight in the background. The only logical thing I could think of was that my phone has been hacked by someone I’d being playing the game with that night and this was a wind up. After resetting 3 phones back to factory settings the problem was still present. This was after trying to convince my partner I wasn’t crazy and this shit was real, making her watch countless you tube videos to prove it, after 2 hours she told me its best I left

I went back to my mates after this on the presumption he might have possibly hacked my phone (he has no IT knowledge and can barley work his toaster) whilst there the noise began to drown out to my relief and I began to relax. Fast forward another 24 hours seshing...

I was chilling in the spare room upstairs when I started hearing the theme tune again... I started freaking out and tried to turn my phone off.. as I did I was convinced I could hear someone outside the house laughing at the fact I couldn’t turn it off (it’s an iPhone I usually use android) I proceeded to throw my phone into the wardrobe convincing myself these hackers where of a professional level. The next 4 hours where spent in some kind internal debate on if it was a good idea to retrieve my phone out the wardrobe, in the end I woke my mate up and made him get it. I proceeded to tell him my theory of what was happening and that I genuinely believed the people who had hacked my phone must be local enough to have heard them.  Thankfully my mate did not tell me to go home but to get some sleep. For the next 6 hours the curtains in the room glowed bright red when I thought someone was getting close to the window, like some motions detector. Every time I went near the bedroom window to look outside I heard a bang.. in the end I woke my mate back up again claiming I’d broken the code they was using to let each other know when I was near a window.. at this point I was asked to leave...

It was myself and two other people and once we finished the long drive we decided to indulge in it.

The cabin is pretty small and tucked away so we felt pretty safe from being heard or seen by anybody. Were the first ones there and pretty soon our other friends show up. Now they were driving a big ass pickup truck with a PA system and police sirens. As a joke they started coming up the driveway with the sirens blaring and saying on the PA, “this is (town we were in) police we have the place surrounded”

When I heard this I basically shit my pants, I thought it was legit. Apparently I wasn’t the only one. One of my other friends moved the blow to another room and he swallowed one of my other friends bagged coke while doing so. 

As you can probably imagine my friend was pissed that he swallowed his blow and were talking about just splitting the rest. But I told him to pull trig because he had just swallowed it. Sure enough, up comes the bag of coke after several tries. He ended up losing a bit but I think he was happy to still have any. 

Also when my friend moved the blow I went to check mine and it was as I had left it so luckily he didn’t choose my blow to swallow but said he was going to swallow it too if it ended up being actual cops. My two other friends were mad at them for the joke but I think their intent was okay they probably under the impression we knew it was them.

This happened in Los Angeles. State of California. I was riding the bus. I was very high on marijuana. I was laughing the whole time. As I walked onto the bus I said “people of color, back of the bus”.

So I’d walk up to people of color and told them they have to sit in the back of the bus. When I saw a white I’d say “ILLUMINATI CONFIRMED” and invite him to sit in the front of the bus.

Well there was an older woman who sat in the front of the bus and refused to move. I was laughing in her face, calling her a Rosa Parks. May have said a few racial slurs too.

Well at the next stop a group of black teenagers walked up to me, shoved me off the bus, gave me a few punches to the face and kicks to the balls.

The negative effects began (all at once) the following morning. I didn't know what was happening at first, my friends tried to tell me that I was just coming down and withdrawing from the meth but I was too delusional to listen to what they were saying. For some reason my right eye feels like it's crossed inward, but everyone that I talk to says that it's not actually crossed. I also wasn't able to fully close my eyes for a day or so after smoking, but it's more controlled now. I constantly have heart palpitations, shortness of breath (it feels like I cannot fully inflate my lungs). My mom says this is just symptoms of anxiety, but she doesn't know I used and she thinks I just drank too much and got alc poisoning. I'm also having urinary retention and I can't maintain a full erection. My friends (who use meth more often than I do) are certain that all of this is just the effects of withdrawal, but it just doesn't make sense to me. My thoughts don't seem organized and they seem all over the place. It feels like I am stuck in a state of permanent depersonalization. 

I was awake for 3 days straight until I finally fell asleep last night. I woke up multiple times during the night and the sleep didn't feel restful at all. I still am exhausted this morning. I have horrible, constant anxiety about all of this and I'm terribly worried that I may have had a stroke and damaged my nervous system.

I'm prescribed Valocordin Diazepam which I've been tapering for a long time. My problem is that sometime in May I was taking my nightly dose and noticed sediment on the bottom of the bottle. For reference, as far as I can understand, the solution consists of 39% ethanol and the rest is diazepam.

I was alarmed because this has never happened before in 3 years I've taken the medication. It was also the first time I left my meds somewhere where my parents could access them. I didn't think twice before but after discovering the sediment, I freaked out and got paranoid. I tried to calm myself down and sent the bottle straight into the manufacturing lab in Germany for testing. The feedback I got from them was that most likely water was added to the solution as the ethanol content was 4.23% instead of 39%, and the active ingredient content was 0.269 g/100 ml instead of 0.95-1.05 g/100 ml. I asked if it was possible that the rest of the batch was okay and it was only the one bottle that was defective. They said no.

The medication is supposed to be taken as drops but I measure the liquid with a syringe because it's easier to taper that way. No needle on the syringe, just for oral administration. The same day my mom was cleaning the fridge with some strong chemicals and they might have gotten to the syringe, but it would only have been a drop or two. Is it possible for diazepam to break down when it comes in contact with certain chemicals? Is it possible for one bottle from a batch of thousands to be faulty?

I've never had fugue-like episodes where I don't have any memory of doing something, let alone meddling with my own meds. Also, the thought of my mom meddling with my meds makes me want to vomit. I wish I could just explain this away in a way where either me or a family member isn't acting like a crazy person.

Beeing in a very good mental place, overchatty with redditors (thank you again folks it's been very fun night), a very good high with a lot of laughs. 

But as soon as the effects of the weed wittered, began feeling anxious. Yesterday I became paranoid over a text, first time ever to feel like this. And I woke up in the middle of this night drenched in sweat into a full blow panic attack. Today's not better, it's panic attacks back to back, leaving me empty drain and sad.

Having panic attack is not abnormal to me. I have them since a long time even in my sober years. I'm phobic with adhd and on the spectrum so I'm struggling with those kind of  mental issues for longer than I can remember.

But I'm connecting some dots here... It's not the first time when weed mixed with alcool brings me in a bad mental place. And when I says this don't imagine it's unreasonnable quantities of both cause half a blunt and a beer or two is litteraly shooting me right up on cloud 9.

From my reads there should be no comedown to expect with weed. So can this be a coincidence ? 

I mean, if I had anxiety while high I would connect A to B but here it's coming only after the high and stays for two to three days.

When I smoke alone I don't have this reaction, I don't mix it with alcool and I'm dosing way less than when I'm with friends. 

What's your opinion of this ? Anxiety related or unrelated to weed ? Maybe not to weed itself but to the mix with alcool ? Stop weed alltogether or just the mixing ? Change strain ?

I'm sad cause right now a blunt would be wonderfull to help me cope with that much anxiety and I feel I might be pouring gas on fire doing so.

When I started I didn't get any warnings from the doctor or something like that and according to the leaflet it was not habit forming. I was following the prescribed dosage and at that time I trusted doctors so I didn't research it at all.

The first time I had problems was when I accidentally missed a dose and taught I had gotten the flue or some shit, at that time I was on 3*300mg per day. It wasn't until the second or third time I made the connection that I was extremely addicted to them, at that time I had been on 3*300mg for 9+ months. 

That scared me a bit, and the positive effects where becoming weaker and weaker so I planned to taper of them REALLY SLOWLY (3*300&gt;2*225mg took 2-3 months and then I was on 2*225 for 5 months because my doctor ""retired"" without notice to me and no other doctor wanted to touch them with a 10 foot pole, when I resumed the tapering it took me about 3-4 months to go from 2*225&gt;0).

I am now 4-5 months clean from it but I still feel like it's dragging me down, I still have the same syntoms I had during the taper plan like low on energy, depression, lower pain threshold, like I feel sic all the time and so on.

Does anyone have experience with long term high dosage Pregabalin usage?

I also have another syntom that I don't dislike, but am dumbfounded by. I don't have withdrawal syntoms from anything else I have taken after... Amphetamine, cocaine or benzos like Klonazepam or Alprazolam, opiates both strong like buprenorfine or weak like codeine haven't made a dent. Was on 8mg klonazepam and 2mg Alprazolam a day for like 2 weeks and quit cold turkey (because I forgot about them), I have had benders for 5-6 days with no sleep and no side effects except for sleepiness. I was exhausted after 2 days before...
Benzos are also really weak for me, I am not an ""experienced"" benzo user but I can eat 2-3mg of real klonazepam (no street pressed chit, directly from the local pharmacy) with no tolerance and not be impaired in any way while my friends get noticeably slurry and impaired on the same dosage.

9:30pm:  Finally decided to get another one. This time between a tesla and the Trump. I chose the trump again. It was 10pm by now and i took the whole thing in the car. After an hour something started to happen then after another hour i I was feeling something but nothing to the effects of mdma.

I was trying to organize random things on my phone like playlists and was focused and determined to accomplish something. What is this Adderall? Smoked 2 joints to try to relax and it worked a little bit only.

2am: I started researching why i felt like this. I've been taking Lexapro for 2 years now and all the forums said that there's no point in taking mdma while on ssri's because the ssri's will render it ineffective. 

3am: Started to make sense. Made a mistake of taking another one 3½ hours later after my last dose. Probably ended up taking 500mg between 6:30pm-10pm.

I pride myself as a person of strong will, and non compulsiveness, but there are certain drugs that remain hard to even be in the same room with, without indulging in them, just because of sheer knowledge and experience of what they feel like.

You don't want to mess with these drugs, *unless* you really, really need them. Why?

**Because you need pain and sleep for most of your life**

You don't wanna go into a fucking benzo withdrawal and not be able to fall asleep for days, even though you're exhausted, just because you LiKe tO ChiLl, or even worse;

go into an opioid withdrawal and be basically the same plus in agony that lasts for days/weeks, just because you like fEeLiNg wArM aNd cUdlY.

Their reward to risk potential is negative (not counting the comedown) compared to say stimulants. The only thing positive about them, is that, until you get hooked, (most people) experience little comedown.

Iearned yesterday that I can snort the substance to get a calming high mixed with stimulant effects such as elevated heart rate (go figure) even if I have ADHD I can still get high from focalin if I take a high enough dose. I started snorting the substance at about 830pm. The total about that I snorted over a 7 hour ish period somewhere between 120 and 160 mg of crushed extended release 10mg pills (about 10 to 20 mg every 30 minutes to an hour depending on my mood) it could have been more I lost count at 100mg. I stopped using it at 3:30 a.m. it is now close to 6am and my heart rate is still fluctuating up and down after not using any focalin for almost 2.5 hours, my pulse is fluctuating rapidly up and down about 20 to 30bpm over about 3 to 5 seconds, for example, from a resting rate of 140 or 150 sometimes as high as 170 or 180  jump down to around 95 to 115bpm no matter how high the resting rate it drops to that BPM level it does this very quickly over about a 3 to 5 second period or faster, always to quick for my pulse ox to read it in real-time, Then it will stay there for a few seconds and my chest will feel kind of funny like a jittering. Then it jumps back up to 140 or 150 or even as high as 180 to 190 just as quickly over a 3 to 5 second period, sometimes the BPM will rapidly jump even farther, like 50 or 60BPM depending on what I'm doing(70bpm drop when going upstairs and laying in bed drop from 192 down to 120bpm so fast that I felt it beat extra hard like I could feel my pulse all over my body until it went back up. If I walk from one end of the room to the other it will fluctuate very widely 60 to 65 beats per minute only when I sit or stop moving. it will also spike very quickly when moving even a little from resting at 120 or 130 BPM once I move around or take a deep breath it almost always reaches 170 and then back down to 120 or 130 BPM over about 10 to 20 seconds after sitting or laying down, when my heart rate slows down quickly I can feel the jittering in my chest it's a strange feeling but not painful just barely noticeable, I also mostly cannot feel my heart beating in my chest I do not feel my heart racing it is beating fast but not hard if that makes sense. my feet even go numb in positions they are usually fine in like my circulation is not reaching my limbs as powerfully as it should but my circulation still is working, just not with it's normal intensity. Like my heart isn't beating as efficiently as normal. I also reach a pulse of 192 just from calmly waking up or down a small staircase of 12 stairs in my home. It reaches 170 or 180 almost everytime I stand from a sitting or laying position or even when I stretch or sit up from laying on my back, even taking a deep breath can sometimes makes it spike to 170 or 180 depending on what it was resting at. it once even jump ed from the high-90s beats per minute to 190bpm about 20 seconds after a 7mg hit of focalin for about 30 seconds then slowly went back to 140 160 current resting rate. My blood pressure is also 160 over 105 stage 2 hypertension. I am also sleep deprived I woke up Monday July 27th at 8:00 a.m. and have been awake for almost 24 hours at 8:00 a.m. this morning I have not slept so my blood pressure and heart rate might be slightly affected by my sleep deprivation if that is the case should I not do this drug when sleep deprived or is it dangerous either way? So my questions are as follows, is this normal? If so how long will the effects last? If this is not normal is this dangerous should I be worried? If this is dangerous how long should I expect this to last? Is this fatal should I call 911? Should I not do this drug anymore if so what will happen if I do, I have ADHD so using focal length with ADHD what is the most effective way/dosage to get a decent high out of this drug. Depending on how my vitals look over the next hour I will update the post please respond quickly because it's a little nerve-wracking seeing your heart do all this funky stuff.

It was tons of fun , sleepovers at eachothers houses like any other group of girls , but smoking bare and listening to music with tons of layers like flat sound or just chatting absolute shit. I'd had a lot of issues with anxiety and depression and the stuff just made me so chill , if not a bit scatty.

But that didnt last too long. Around a year after I started smoking my friends brother sexually assaulted me while I was high , and soon after that I had a very intense acid trip where I smoked and looped during ego death. Both experiences fucked me up really bad.

After those expeirences smoking became hell, I'd have intense flashbacks , paranoid dillusions (I'd pissed myself , people I was with hated me etc.) I'd go mute or gain no joy from anything I did. I lost my phone 5 times from entering these dissociative episodes.

I quit essentially completely for about a year. 

It's been over 4 years since I started smoking and now my experiences are 50/50. I describe it like a dice roll, I might have a really pleasent enjoyable high , or I might totally shut down. Drinking / taking valis before really helps , but I hate not just being able to roll a joint or hit a bong and enjoy myself.

And he said he acted upon his pedo needs to me a week prior so I confronted him and told him I wouldn't be seeing him again and wished him the best as I had screenshots and still do proving him saying yes this is what I said not wrote.

I have been very close to them for years and had to let them know because they have a grand daughter and another new born grand daughter as well. I worried for them.

I'd like to “celebrate” by sharing pieces of my story, cobbled together from assignments I completed during a treatment program. Disclaimer: This is my own story. I do not judge anyone for what they do or don't do.     


I have experienced depression and anxiety since childhood, and one of the main reasons that I used substances was to escape from and numb every negative emotion that appeared. As a result, I never learned how to deal with my feelings in a healthy and effective way. In desperate attempts to avoid experiencing depression, self-hatred, and anxiety, I reached out to any substance that was available: alcohol, weed, hallucinogens, dissociatives, deliriants, benzos, cocaine, meth, opiate pills. However, it was heroin that was most effective at obliterating my emotions, and it quickly tightened its grip on me. Over years of addiction, I slowly became overwhelmed with feelings of hopelessness, despair, fear, guilt, shame, and desperation. My self-esteem was lower than it had ever been, and I became convinced that I was destined to continue living, and eventually die, as a junkie.     


As I descended deeper into addiction, there was a sharp decline in my self-care, and I eventually stopped taking care myself altogether: skipping medications and appointments, going months without bathing, and working 75+ hours a week at two jobs just to throw away every cent on drugs. I hated myself and who I had become. I eventually stopped paying bills altogether. I had 2 cars repossessed, had my phone service shut off, defaulted on multiple loans, had both of my credit cards charged off, and lost my bank accounts. I was slated to lose my job and apartment. The continued deterioration of my mental and emotional health eventually culminated in two attempts to end my life. Only during the resulting hospitalizations did I finally start to believe that I might be able to stop using drugs.   


So why stay clean? Because my life literally depends on it. There are several reasons for this. First, my suicide attempts resulted in organ damage. Second, using heroin intravenously is extremely risky, even when safety precautions are taken. Third, and perhaps most important, the lifestyle I was living was not only unsustainable, it was demoralizing, degrading, and humiliating. My self-hatred soared to new heights, and I could see no light at the end of the tunnel. I felt like a complete failure, and I became tired of fighting, struggling, and suffering. I not only isolated myself, but consciously pushed people away when they tried to help. The bottom line is, if I return to active addiction, I will die. Whether it is intentional or not, the result will be the same.     


I'm grateful to be off of heroin, and I'm finally working on addressing underlying issues that have existed since childhood. Since my youth, I have struggled with rock-bottom self-esteem and a complete lack of self-worth. Because I cared so little about myself, I treated my body like a garbage can, flooding it with any chemical I could get my hands on. While I have always been aware of the potential ramifications, I did not respect myself enough to care. I experienced consequences that should have scared me into getting clean, including several brushes with death and narrowly avoiding arrest. However, I felt so worthless that I did not believe that I could get clean, and I often convinced myself that I did not deserve to get clean. Now that I have been clean for a year, I have been rediscovering abilities that I thought had been lost forever. My determination, perseverance, reliability, and integrity have reappeared, and I'm finally working toward self-acceptance and forgiveness.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,697365,public,confidence,self,1 year off of heroin - some introspection,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hz9qg5/1_year_off_of_heroin_some_introspection/,no_ads,0.0,1595947381.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had a bad oxycodone problem in my teens, which turned to heroin then to methadone. Been off that for years now, but still use kratom daily because I can’t smoke weed for another 2 months. 

During the quarantine I did anything possible to escape reality. Took LSD constantly, mushrooms way too often. Unhealthy mentally and physically in ways. I got into phenibut thinking it’s all good, I’ll use it as much as I’d like and taper off. Nope. That shit made me feel AWFUL whether I took it or not. It’s like it truly damaged my receptors or something. ——This is all my fault and not the drugs.—-

Due to the phenibut situation, it made it so my kratom started making me feel pretty bad most of the time. A weird feeling in my head that led to pretty bad anxiety which then in turn made my minor HPPD worse. So I am now almost completely off kratom, about 2GPD. 

It’s just crazy how just a few months ago I wasn’t happy with baseline and a minor buzz from kratom, while now I’m just so happy to not feel like I’m going to lose my shit. I can already tell that my emotions are coming back, think clearer and surprisingly better at video games... which my favorite thing to do in HS was eat oxycodone and play COD. All in all, was happy to make this post and also remind people to be careful with substances. Remember there is a —-kindling effect——which basically means if you quit a substance once and the WD wasn’t bad (example, gabapentin or phenibut,) you may try to quit a second time and it can be HELLISH to get off of. 

These “gaba” drugs are a different ball game. Opiate WD sucks bad, but I personally struggled so badly I almost wanted to go to the hospital/rehab at points.  Not all will struggle like I did due to your personal neurochemistry or whatever, but just keep in mind WD from Xanax/phenibut/gabapentin can be absolutely brutal and last awhile for some.

The evening went pretty well, just a lot of talking philosophy and shit, then I felt I had pretty much come down so I went home. Not long after I got home (about an hour later and 6-7 hours after we dropped) she started texting me about feeling God's love and having this crazy religious experience and feeling Jesus with her and everything. I asked more about it and she seems to be feeling really really good, says she still feels pretty high. It seems a bit manic to me and I'm worried that maybe the MDMA could be triggering some kind of episode? She doesn't have any formal diagnosis but has struggled with depression and possibly ADHD.

I reminded her that taking care of her body is just as important as her spirit and that sleeping soon would help make sure she doesn't feel completely awful tomorrow. She was receptive to the idea and even mentioned that she felt like Jesus' love also wanted her to sleep, but she still seems pretty preoccupied with writing down her revelations so she won't forget them later. Her texts have a decent amount of typos but the words make sense.

How concerned should I be? Is this a common experience? Could she just be really sensitive to it? I'm really worried that something might be wrong and I don't know what to do.

Idk where my other dxming buddy went but it was at the point in the night where I was chilling on my buddy's bed sitting at the end, and the kid with the weed was across from me on a bean bag/chair. Now anyone who knows dxm, knows weed wildly potentiates it. 

I'm already pretty dissociated from the dxm alone, but as soon as the bong was handed to me and I ripped it, I full on dissociated and was on the ceiling looking down and me and him talking, Im guessing I was dissociated for a good 15 minutes but it's been 8 years so who knows at this point. I do know we were talking during my dissociation.

Now heres my question:
For anyone on the other side of it, aka the dude who was just smoking weed, what does the dissociated person look like or act like? Are they on pilot mode still keeping up with the convo unconsciously? Or are they sitting their looking brain dead in a stupor or mumbling their own non sense?

But I had my most life changing trip a while back and thought that this was the place for it. I’m also sorry that this is gonna be kinda long and I’m sorry if I’m including too much irrelevant detail in here, I’m just writing what me and my friends remember from that night.

So basically my girlfriend invited me and about 5 other friends to hang out and spend a week at her beach house and I was really excited because we had had a beach week several months prior over spring break and it was a great time and everyone loved it.

So at this beach week just about everyone wanted to trip. I’ll refer to our little cast of characters as D, M, L, S, C, and G just for privacy’s sake. D, M, L, and my girlfriend S had never tripped before but me and C had some experience tripping. In addition to all of us tripping, our friend G was involuntarily trip sitting us because we didn’t have enough stuff for her to trip too. I had tripped acid about 6 previous times with dosages between 100-300 and had never had anything but a great time with very little anxiety. So this week I brought down 2 tabs of janky 150μg and an eighth of shrooms for my friends, while my friend C had brought down 3 tabs of tested 200μg for me and him because he was taking 2 tabs. 

So on trip day, we get everyone together and I give the 150μg tabs to D and M and split the eighth of shrooms with S and L. S does a lemon tek and L just chows down on the shrooms and the rest of us hung out and talked a little because we wanted to give them a little time to start feeling something. So about 20 minutes passes and the rest of us drop. 

Immediately after dropping we all go out and start smoking because G brought her bong. The strain was G13 (trust me this comes back in the story later). After passing the bong around a few times we go back inside and I sit down and start admiring the tracers on my hands and the breathing walls a little bit. Then my girlfriend tells me that she was feeling a little sick from the shrooms so I go lay down on the couch and start cuddling with her. Then we start making out really hard and everyone got kind of uncomfortable and left for a minute. We finally stopped and then all of a sudden everything just kinda blacks out. I don’t remember much but little bits and pieces of the next 5 or 6 hours but from what I was told I ran around the entire house dancing then when M questioned me on it I just started beating him up on the couch. I eventually stopped and then he yelled at me to which I then responded by running at him and hitting him even more. Then I ran up to my friend C who was just silently chilling off the 2 tabs and started shaking him and yelling “YOU WILL NOT” over and over again. 

Then I guess I just suddenly grabbed my girlfriends hand, went into our bedroom, and started completely losing it. I layed down on the bed and started freaking out and crying. From my perspective all I could see at this point was her face surrounded by blurred visuals of the room. I didn’t know who I was or where I was or what was happening. All I knew is that I wanted it to stop. By this point she was done tripping off the shrooms and was trying everything she could to calm me down. The first thing that I really remember in detail after coming into the room was laying on the bed completely drenched in sweat with all the sheets and blankets thrown off. I was the most scared I had ever been and I couldn’t stop myself from crying. In my head I kept thinking that I was in a hospital bed being restrained, in the back of an ambulance, or in the back of a police car. All of these delusions just kept switching between each other the entire time. I was also terrified that my girlfriend was gonna break up with me because I thought that nobody would want to stay with someone after seeing them losing their mind as much as I was in that moment. 

During all of this I could hear everyone else outside our room yelling and having a good time and it was very overwhelming because it just sounded so loud to me and I thought for sure the neighbors had already called the cops because of it. My concept of time was also extremely slowed down to the point where I’d be sitting on the bed for what felt like literal hours but when I looked at my watch, exactly 2 minutes had passed. Around this time I also had convinced myself that the tab i had taken was actually a microchip and by swallowing it I had caused my body to glitch. I also remember thinking that there was some type of line when it came to tripping and that if you crossed it you would be stuck tripping forever as punishment and I was absolutely convinced that I had crossed it and would be forced to live the rest of my life in that terrified state as revenge for my carelessness.

My girlfriend kept talking to me throughout my entire bad trip and just kept trying to keep me from dissociating any further and keep me somewhat grounded in reality by making sure to show and tell me what was real and what wasn’t and helping show me the distinction between the two. She also kept reassuring me that it was only a drug and told me a lot of other things that really ended up helping me that I won’t share. But for whatever reason every time she would leave the bedroom for probably 30 seconds to check on the others, I would get so overwhelmingly scared that I would completely spiral all over again.

But once I finally got to the point where I was starting to calm down a little she took me around to different rooms of the house because I felt uncomfortable being in the bedroom. When she took me upstairs I got intimidated because I felt like being upstairs was too high off the ground and when she took me outside I felt exposed to the elements and scared so she ended up just having to bring me back inside but on the way inside I saw a spider web and hallucinated a massive spider right in the middle of it (I’m ridiculously afraid of spiders) and when I asked her if it was real she told me it wasn’t and I suddenly just wasn’t bothered by it anymore which is an absolute miracle because seeing something like that sober would cause me to spiral a little bit so I have no idea why it did nothing that time.

Eventually I had calmed down to the point where I was capable of handling myself on my own and she went to bed because she had work in the morning and I went to go rejoin everyone else. And when I did everyone immediately yelled “THAT G13 GOT YOU” and I had forgotten what G13 meant but it felt like such a familiar term so when I asked them what it was and they showed me the bag of weed I immediately became convinced that all weed was called G13 regardless of the strain and that G13 was just the common household name for weed, but it felt so much more futuristic and scientific than it ever had before. Almost like it had been delivered by aliens or made in some secret government facility or something.

The whole rest of the trip was ok for me but I never felt truly happy the rest of the time. Like for every other trip I had had up to that point I had been genuinely happy and I had just been in awe at the beauty of the trip itself but I was mostly just kind of contemplative and never really at peace and the closest I got to happy for that trip was just like an awkward disconcerting type of happiness. It’s hard to explain how I really felt but that’s about as close to it as I can get. 

There was honestly a lot more to that trip than I’ve even described but I’m afraid that this already seems to be too long so imma cut it off here but feel free to ask about more if you wanna hear more about it. 

After it was all said and done the next morning I fell asleep and just felt really uncomfortable and on edge when I woke up. Like everyone was ok but not back to normal yet. I kinda tried to laugh it off with everyone else but I was really noticeably uneasy when talking about it to everyone. To this day only C and S know the full extent of everything. 

My most important takeaway from it was honestly that it strengthened the bond that me and my girlfriend share. I know I can never repay her for everything that she did for me that night and I still thank her profusely every time that trip comes up. And it just really means so much to me that she would do all that for me when no one else in the house even seemed to care. The things that she told me when I was at my lowest really had a major impact on me and still stick with me to this day. I don’t know how I would’ve ended up without her by my side so I really am just so much more thankful and grateful for everything she does for me even when I’m not having a breakdown on acid. 

Another big takeaway is that it was a wake up call for me in terms of the kind of person that i was and the type of life that I was living. I had been a straight edge Christian kid my entire life and then popped off and went way overboard after moving out to go to college and during this whole experience I was forced to look at myself very bluntly and see the kind of person that I had become. I realized that I was the kind of person that blacked out from drinking every weekend, the kind of person that bugged out on acid at my girlfriends beach house and ruined everyone else’s night, the kind of person that had said they would never even smoke weed but was snorting perc and hydro lines at parties. I was ashamed at who I had become and I had gotten such a raw look at how terrible I was to the people I cared so deeply about. Since then I have not tripped again, I have stayed away from all pills, I have quit nicotine, I have taken a temporary break from weed, and I’ve put a serious check on my drinking. I really am thankful for that trip showing me this because I was right on the cusp of going from bad to worse in a lot of different areas and I do believe that this saved me right in the nick of time. I think that acid is a beautiful drug and an experience that everyone should try at least once but despite all of the beautiful experiences I’ve had tripping, I think it had finally served its final purpose for me. And although that was the scariest experience of my life I would never change it for anything because I do believe that what I got out of it changed the course of my life in several ways and made me a better person. 

So that’s the story of my final and most impactful trip.

Weed was my life saver but I was never told about cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome and lucky me I now can't use weed...

The good news is that the injury itself is responding to treatment so I won't need to keep getting zonked out for the rest of my life. But for now, I am devastated without weed. 

My doctor wants to write me a prescription for something so I can cope until my injury fully heals. She is letting me choose as far as what to take.

I know nothing about prescription drugs and have heard some are awesome while some are a waste of time. I was hoping you guys could recommend something.

What I'm looking for is something that will mimic weed as closely as possible, although I dont think such a thing exists. 

Basically I loved how weed zonked me out but at the same time it didnt. In other words, it zonked me out from a pain standpoint, but it also made me hyper analytical, and ""heightened"" my perception of a lot of things, ie music, humor, etc. Weed enhanced me and tickled my brain more than it turned me into a vegetable, but it was also a fantastic pain killer.

I worked from 8am-11pm and I had about idk 40 or so 60mg extended release Vyvanse so I started out my day w/ 60mg around 7am. 

I enjoy uppers a lot so I don't do them often, in fact this experience was over a year ago but once I got to work I knocked out my open (3hrs of work) in like 45 min or less.

I was also the manager so I could just leave whenever to ""smoke a cig"". I think I just went outside and hit my cart (probably some pesty cart too) and took another 60mg and went back inside.

I was super chatty and I liked the way the THC mixed w/ the euphoric effects that came from the Vyvanse. The high also made time fly by so to me it seemed like a few orders later and I was onto my next 60mg Vyvanse.

By this time its probably 6pm and it had actually been kind of slow at work but it got busy out of nowhere so I took my final 60mg Vyvanse. 

By this time I was a raging machine outworking everyone in the building and my heart was running faster than Usain Bolt. 

I actually started to get worried because my heart was racing and pounding out of my chest for over an hour and I had insane cold sweats. By the time I got home I felt miserable from all the energy that I'd had ALL day.

All prescription are meant to solve specific problems, so the biggest (and most obvious) piece is having knowledge of what you're going for. This is important for people who don't actually need them (I don't judge), but it's equally as important for those who actually do. Sometimes it can be hard to express your issue clearly and get what you really need, so doing some research and hearing more articulate people discuss it can help you get your thoughts across properly.

That's very broad and all encompassing, but here's a specific examples that might help if you happen to be pursuing it.

If you're trying to get ADHD medication, understand how the illness really works. It isn't often linked to external stimuli, most don't have the cliche ""oh look a butterfly"" problem. It's much more internal, the mind distracts itself. Tell the Dr. that you space out often and find yourself thinking ""too loud"". Say that you will put forth lots of effort into listening to someone, but can't absorb anything their saying because your thoughts are overlapping them too much. If you're a student or have a job, tell them that you can't focus on work because you get lost in your own head. I know some of this may seem obvious, you may think ""yeah of course I'd say I can't focus"", but those ""becauses"" really matter, it sells it.

The key is making things personal. Don't dish out a laundry list of symptoms, apply it to your everyday life, give specific examples, don't just make it sound like a problem that exists, make it sound like a problem YOU struggle with.

All consciousness is, is energy interacting with matter. If that theory trickles down, even a rock is technically conscious, because it contains energy. By that same principle, drugs are conscious to a certain extent. \n\nHow about a virus? Is a virus “conscious” the same way a human is? No. But does it have an innate desire and configuration that results in its own reproduction and continuation of species? Yes. There are certain viruses that hijack neural pathways and cause the host to do things they would not normally do. \n\nNow think about a Tulpa. A Tulpa, if you do not know, is a thought-form-energy-ghost, that is a consciousness bound to nothing, created from the ideas of man (highly compressed description of the subject). Basically, it’s an imaginary friend that takes on a mind of its own, and is itself conscious. \n\nIf you can follow where i’m going with this, could it not be said that drugs have taken on somewhat of a combined viral-tulpa-like consciousness, wherein they have created a group of addicts that “need” them to exist, which in turn creates a group of suppliers who will actually make the drugs, continuing to bring them back into existence, acting like the host of the virus, constantly spreading it and keeping it alive. Now, this does not mean that the drugs consciousness is deciding to be destructive. There are many different drugs, not all of them destructive. Caffeine for example. But then, what about heroin or meth? Highly destructive! In my opinion, drugs all have their own “personalities,” to a weird degree. The more you get to know them, the more they show you their real self. It’s like meeting a really charismatic sociopath for the first time, and they’re so much fucking fun to go out drinking and partying with, and then as you hang out with them more frequently you realize, wow they’re actually pretty self centered and rude as fuck and wait what did they say about me while i wasn’t around? \n\nI liken addiction to being in an abusive relationship. As an addict, you are glued to your substance(s) because you truly believe that they’re helping you with whatever bullshit you think you need them for. As someone in an abusive relationship, you think about all the small good things that they ever did to show they care, and try to forgive the glaring issues that they have. It’s, really a pretty similar situation. As someone who has personally gone through both, it’s, really almost exactly the same feeling. The addict is not the abuser.

There are certain viruses that hijack neural pathways and cause the host to do things they would not normally do. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now think about a Tulpa. A Tulpa, if you do not know, is a thought-form-energy-ghost, that is a consciousness bound to nothing, created from the ideas of man (highly compressed description of the subject). Basically, it’s an imaginary friend that takes on a mind of its own, and is itself conscious. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can follow where i’m going with this, could it not be said that drugs have taken on somewhat of a combined viral-tulpa-like consciousness, wherein they have created a group of addicts that “need” them to exist, which in turn creates a group of suppliers who will actually make the drugs, continuing to bring them back into existence, acting like the host of the virus, constantly spreading it and keeping it alive. Now, this does not mean that the drugs consciousness is deciding to be destructive. There are many different drugs, not all of them destructive. Caffeine for example. But then, what about heroin or meth? Highly destructive! In my opinion, drugs all have their own “personalities,” to a weird degree. The more you get to know them, the more they show you their real self. It’s like meeting a really charismatic sociopath for the first time, and they’re so much fucking fun to go out drinking and partying with, and then as you hang out with them more frequently you realize, wow they’re actually pretty self centered and rude as fuck and wait what did they say about me while i wasn’t around? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I liken addiction to being in an abusive relationship. As an addict, you are glued to your substance(s) because you truly believe that they’re helping you with whatever bullshit you think you need them for. As someone in an abusive relationship, you think about all the small good things that they ever did to show they care, and try to forgive the glaring issues that they have. It’s, really a pretty similar situation. As someone who has personally gone through both, it’s, really almost exactly the same feeling. The addict is not the abuser. The addict is the abused.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'addiction', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qwvc', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/addiction', 'subreddit_subscribers': 44101, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': 'confidence', 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'Drugs are conscious beings involved in abusive relationships with their addicts.', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 9, 'upvote_ratio': 0.8, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hyrwov/drugs_are_conscious_beings_involved_in_abusive/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'no_ads', 'wls': 0}]",/r/addiction/comments/hyrwov/drugs_are_conscious_beings_involved_in_abusive/,,,,,,,,,,

As with my other posts, this summary is based on my extensive personal experience as well as anecdotal reports from other people with a few objective effects thrown in. I hope you enjoy the updated information and if I left anything out or something that you think I should change, please let me know :)*

## Physical effects

* [**Stimulation**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) &amp; [**Sedation**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) \- At lower doses, GHB is physically stimulating, encouraging movement and wakefulness. At higher doses when the GABA-b threshold is met (4-6g/ml), however, it becomes physically sedating, encouraging sleep and lethargy. This effect is colloquially known as ""G-ing out"" and is responsible for the incorrect stereotyping of GHB as an exclusively sedating substance.
* [**Physical euphoria**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) \- This component is generally not as strong as the cognitive euphoria that can be induced. The sensation itself can be described as feelings of tingling, warmth, and energy.
* [**Perception of bodily lightness**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness#:~:text=Perception%20of%20bodily%20lightness%20can,and%20therefore%20effortless%20to%20move) **or** [**Perception of bodily heaviness**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)\- In low-common doses, GHB causes the user's body to feel light and floaty. This is due to the stimulatory properties of low doses of GHB. This is suddenly reversed as the user reaches the GABA-b threshold wherein the user will feel stoned in comparison.
* [**Respiratory depression**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) **or Respiratory enhancement** \- In low doses, due to catecholamine and glutamate release, GHB reliably increases respiration rates like other stimulants. However, in cases of GHB overdoses, many reportedly experience an abnormal pattern of breathing characterized by progressively deeper and sometimes faster breathing followed by a gradual decrease that results in a temporary stop in breathing called an apnea.
* [**Muscle relaxation**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) \- GHB induces profound muscle relaxation similar to, but more intense than, the relaxation produced by [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol). This muscle relaxation is accompanied with a general loss of motor control, which may put the user at increased risk of physical injury.
* [**Bodily Control Enhancement**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement#:~:text=Bodily%20control%20enhancement%20can%20be,balance%2C%20coordination%2C%20and%20dexterity) **or** [**Motor control loss**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)  \- In low doses, GHB reliably increases bodily control due to the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and glutamate similarly to amphetamine. This is reversed suddenly as the dose increases where one ""Gs out.""
* [**Dehydration**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)
* [**Dizziness**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness) \- Dizziness is a common side effect of GHB and can occur with normal recreational doses. Users may also suddenly feel light-headed or faint, and feel a strong urge to lie down. Colloquially known as ""the spins"".
* [**Nausea**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)
* [**Muscle cramps**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps) **-** This is uncommon, but can occur as a result of heavy physical activities such as dancing, exercise, and sex.
* [**Optical sliding**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Optical_sliding)
* [**Increased salivation**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation) **-** This effect is reversed as the stimulatory effects are replaced by sedative effects.
* [**Pupil dilation**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation) **-** This effect is typical of both stimulants and GABA-b agonists.

## Cognitive effects

* [**Analysis suppression**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression) \- This effect is common in both low and high doses, but the intensity is dose-dependent. 
* [**Analysis enhancement**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement) \- In low-moderate doses, this effect is consistent in its manifestation and [outrospection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Outrospection) dominant. This effect is quickly reversed as the dose increases. 
* [**Anxiety suppression**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) **-**  GHB has medium to strong anxiolytic effects, although generally less powerful than [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines). It prioritizes social anxiety and agoraphobia over generalized anxiety. 
* [**Cognitive euphoria**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria) \- GHB produces intense states of euphoria comparable to that of [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine), [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA), and [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates). For this reason, it is sometimes called ""liquid ecstasy"". It is commonly described as a more euphoric and disinhibiting version of alcohol. It is common to experience a ""rush"" that is subjectively similar, but more enjoyable than the rush of a typical dopaminergic stimulant, possibly due to the simultaneous release of serotonin and glutamate.
* [**Disinhibition**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) \- Social and behavioral disinhibition on GHB is extremely powerful and perhaps its most prominent feature. Users are more liable to exhibit impaired decision-making and engage in risky activities such as unprotected sex or unsafe substance combinations. Users are advised to only take GHB in safe environments with people they trust not to take advantage of their vulnerable state.
* [**Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement) \- GHB presents strong [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects which, although weaker than that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA), are still prominent and well defined. Because of this, GHB has shown promise in certain psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder, PTSD, and anxiety disorders. 
* [**Immersion enhancement**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement) \- This effect is mild only present in low doses.
* [**Increased libido**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) \- GHB produces profound libido enhancement comparable to methamphetamine and is generally stronger than MDMA.
* [**Increased music appreciation**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation) **-** This effect is typically reduced in intensity as the dose increases
* [**Memory suppression**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression) **or** [**Memory Enhancement**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement) \- Low doses of GHB reliably produce multiple cognitive enhancements due to glutamate, serotonin, and dopamine release. 
   * [**Amnesia**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) \- This effect presents itself as poor memory in doses exceeding the GABA-b threshold before evolving into full blackouts in overdose.
* [**Thought deceleration**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration) **or** [**Though acceleration**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration) \- As with many other dose-dependent effects of GHB, low doses reliably induce thought acceleration while high doses reliably induce thought deceleration. High doses produce a state of stupor and mild confusion. Coupled with the amnestic and powerful sedating effects of GHB, this can lead to a very physically vulnerable state. Having trusted peers around when experiencing these effects is important.
* [**Spatial disorientation**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation) \- This effect is generally very mild or nonexistent in low doses, but very common in high doses, especially when one ""Gs out.""
* [**Suggestibility enhancement**](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suggestibility_enhancement)

### Tolerance and addiction potential

GHB is highly physically and psychologically addictive with a high abuse potential. The frequent use of GHB can cause withdrawal symptoms similar to those caused by other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) and [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) if abruptly discontinued.[\[31\]](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB#cite_note-31)[\[32\]](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB#cite_note-32) These symptoms seem to depend on the dosage and the length of time the drug was used for. Light to moderate users often experience anxiety, insomnia, sleep-related problems, and tremors whereas heavy use can cause severe withdrawal symptoms like delirium, psychosis, and hallucinations.[\[33\]](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB#cite_note-33)[\[30\]](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB#cite_note-GHB-30)

Although there have been reported fatalities due to GHB withdrawal, reports are inconclusive and further research is needed.[\[34\]](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB#cite_note-34)

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within several weeks of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. GHB presents cross-tolerance with [1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) and [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL), since these act as [prodrugs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Prodrug) for GHB. Cross-tolerance with [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) and [baclofen](https://psychonautwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Baclofen&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1) has been shown in rats.[\[35\]](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB#cite_note-35)[\[36\]](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB#cite_note-36)",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,697274,public,confidence,self,[Updated] GHB's Psychonautwiki Page,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hz4jjk/updated_ghbs_psychonautwiki_page/,no_ads,0.0,1595925316.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don’t plan on being back to using anything, not anything at all and I’m working towards stopping cigs and beer. If any of you are tired of the day to day drug use don’t be afraid to be yourself and to strive to be better!

I’ve made good connections here and all throughout Reddit and I’m astounded by the positive in communities like these. Also, I hit 50k karma. 50k people liked what I posted and that’s insane because I’m typically a dummy.

Over the past two years I had a large supply of Adderall that has slowly been dwindling until it ran out 3 days ago. It first started as a twice a month thing to dick around with when my parents were away for the weekend. I would leave for university and wouldn't touch it for a few months.

Then starting around last winter I was doing poor by my standards in school. Felt burnt out and all of that. Would come home and tell my parents that I feel like I'm struggling so my dad told me he had this old prescription of adderall that he used to have and he told me that I could use them. I faked being surprised and pulled the ""I don't know pops drugs are kinda bad right"". Still of course I took them. 

Using this for exams and papers felt like I've missed out on something at my time at university. I was always a decent student but with this it raised all my courses by at least 5-10%. Adderall was now something that I didn't just used to mess around with and play video games.

 Now it was used to make me a better student and enjoy everything I was assigned to do. It meant shooting the shit at the library all day, listening to tunes, smoking ciggies and writing papers. These days were more fun for me then going out on Fridays with the roommates honestly. No better feeling than waking up and knowing your going to have a fun day at the library that would end with some doobies and a couple of beers.

Well now I've run out my supply, and the last 40 sessions spanned over a month compared to before where that was a years supply. Every comedown in this last month or two was met with a benzo, weed, and hard drinking session that lasted till the 2 in the morning. Every morning I would feel like shit and empty inside so I had would just pop in another Adderall. I haven't been using them to study now but rather just dick around on the internet making memes and shit. The last pill I took, that evening I told myself thank god this is over. You won't be able to do this shit for a long time.

It's been 3 days and I feel so desperate to find another source of these pills now. I know a few streams of opportunity in which I can gain more pills. But what's the end game here? I can't study without it, my days are empty without it, and I'm slowly ruining my body with benzos and booze. It feels like I have strained my relationships with my friends and family because I would just lock myself in my room all day. I don't want to hangout with anyone unless I can get fucked up but that's a seperate issue. 

Im sitting outside a 7/11 after downing a five hour energy and sipping a monster just wanting someone to say something to me. It gives me a tenth of that feeling I had with Adderall but it's welcomed indeed.

 None of my friends know I abuse this and I don't want to even talk to them because I don't even feel like I'm that close with any of them like before. My family seems like former selves of themselves in which my dad sits on the couch watching tv after dinner everyday. He ridicules my mom for staring at her iPad all day which is true but hypocritical. My brother is someone who I used to be close with but now I find him selfish and disinterested in anything in my life. They love me and I love them, but they are all different now. Dads a pessimistic and cynical fucker haha, my mom is glued to her screen all day and does nothing to help my dad and kids around the house. My brother only cares about himself and we only have surface level conversations. The only person I can talk to and who cares for me is my girlfriend. She doesn't understand how fucked up addiction is and just thinks I need to man up and move on with Adderall, nicotine and booze. She cares for me and she is right in a lot of ways but sometimes it's hard to communicate what my issues are because she doesn't understand addiction (she's very clean cut). 

I know this is long and boring but I just need someone to talk to me. I'm in a good situation in my life currently with ambitions and motivation but I feel like I'm playing with fire. I'm at a point in time where Adderall could fuck my life up if I don't take it too seriously.

The three month rule is both well-understood, yet also somehow pretty divisive in the drug community. I just wanted to share my thoughts and experience with both abiding by this rule, and also breaking it.

First of all, the three month rule isn't about tolerance. Tolerance resets in (I think) about two weeks. The three month rule is about preserving the ""magic"" of the substance, i.e. making every roll feel the same as the last.

At the beginning of my time taking MDMA, I strictly adhered to the three month (or more) rule. I never took more than a point at a time, and I never took more than two points in one night. During this time, MDMA was **amazing**. Every roll felt like the first one, and I never felt the need to up my dose. 180lb male never needed more than 100mg per dose.

As time went on, I started getting a little complacent. I wouldn't go as far as saying I got too reckless, but I definitely let my morals slip. **I still never took more than 250mg in one day**, but I started taking it a little more frequently, maybe once per month. A couple months I did twice in the same month, but never had multiple months in a row like that. Sometimes I'd take it two days in a row as well.

Recently since the start of 2020, I've been back on a ""healthy"" usage of MDMA. Always waiting 3 months or more between rolls, and continuing to be careful with my dosage. But something is just different.

100mg no longer feels like it used to. I'm confident that purity of product is not an issue. And it's not like I can't tell that I took MDMA. But the waves of euphoria, the loving aura around everybody, hell even the jaw clenching, they're all not the same. It hits me weaker now.

I should clarify now, that I **did** try taking two points at once, just to see what happens. And *that* was a good roll. Felt everything I should have. Candy flipping is also still fantastic. But 100mg of MDMA on its own has definitively lost its luster. At least for now.

So here I am, one month after my most recent roll, and I'm taking a break until at least 2021, to see if maybe a longer break brings some of the magic back.

I still love MDMA, but I lost respect for it, and I think it lost respect for me in return.

TL;DR - 3 month rule is important. 100mg no longer feels like it used to.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,697253,public,confidence,self,MDMA 3 month rule: Thoughts and personal experience/opinion,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hz2tc1/mdma_3_month_rule_thoughts_and_personal/,no_ads,0.0,1595919132.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Okay so my boyfriend has been doing fentanyl for about 6 months. Today he has finally decided to quit and couldn’t be more grateful. 
He is just very worried because he’s coming off of smoking about a gram/half gram a day. he’s significantly slowed down to about ~3-5 points per day, and now has suboxone and is going through the beginning of withdrawals right now. His last hoot was about 8 hours ago and he’s trying to make it atleast another 4 before taking his first Suboxone. 
Anybody have any experience tips/info/advice for him or for me as I’ll be taking care of him? I literally told him I don’t care if you puke all night and stuff comes out both ends, we’re going to get through it together. I told him we’ll smoke a shit ton of weed, he can take some Advil &amp; hopefully sleep a lot of it away.. with me waking him up for his doses every 2 hrs.

The measurement of my disappointment towards this sub was too huge for me to carry on my shoulders... I guess I had too much expectations towards you guys.

What happened is that I provided the idea that the government sell us harmful and unnatural drugs to all of us while at the same time making sure possessing natural ones would be a crime. The reasons behind that prohibition can be debatable but I can assure you they are not doing this with your children's best interests at heart

The answers I got was that cigarettes, alchohol, energy drinks and pharmaceutical drugs were just as natural and pure as cannabis or at least that there was not that much difference. My countet argument was that cigarettes have 5000 toxic chemicals but still I was downvoted to hell. Told that I don't understand what is a manmade vs a natural drug...

SO PLEASE answer this simple question-
How the fuck can you compare drugs that can be NATURALLY collected in nature without ANY human's interventions  to the ones being processed and transformed by our hands? Magic mushrooms, cannabis, salvia, ayahuasca, etc can all found freely in Mother Nature. Can you claim the same about beers and cigarettes just to name a few...

I got downvoted to hell on what should be the most opened and awakened subreddit by stating the FACTS that your government is telling you that possessing a plant like cannabis, which can be found naturally in nature, is a crime but then they sell you a transformed tobacco plant with 5000+ toxic chemicals with no problem. And I'm not even gonna start to talk about the many pharmaceutical drugs which are by definition manmade chemicals with dozens of secondary effects, all of those drugs being prescribed in the millions everyday.

This was my 20th or so trip, and I had thought that my 5th time tripping was a bad trip, but that was absolutely nothing compared to this terrifying experience. My dosage was 2 grams of hydroponic shrooms, which were mostly heads. I was in a perfectly comfortable environment, an empty house other than my friends and me. I began tripping after only 15 minutes which was easily the quickest shrooms or acid had ever hit me. I tripped pretty hard for about two hours, and then it pretty much completely wore off.

Next, my friends and I decided to smoke some weed because none of us were really tripping anymore. I did six gravity bong bowls, which was a major mistake. This wasn't my first time smoking on psychedelics, and I was aware that it intensified the effects. (I'm a very regular smoker with a high tolerance). About ten minutes after smoking, I started to have the most intense ego-death I have ever experienced. A couple of minutes later, I looked around and it felt like I was in a parallel universe version of the house because everything looked so different, but also the same.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where my bad trip starts.

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly, my right leg started feeling like the bones were breaking and the joints were being twisted in ways they aren't meant to. Immediately, I started screaming in pain, scaring the hell out of my friends. The pain started moving all the way up my leg into my back, arms, and chest. I began feeling a super sharp pain right in my heart. I started to wonder if the shrooms were laced, which only made me panic more. It felt like sharp blades were being pressed into me all over my body. When I looked at my leg, I was tripping so hard that it looked to me like the bone was starting to pop out of the skin. Everything felt like it was contorting in the absolute worst way. The sharp pain in my heart increased and increased, to the point that I thought I was having a heart attack and that I was about to die. I stumbled over to the bathroom, where I vomited twice. But as I was vomiting, I felt like I was in the process of dying. I've never remotely felt the certainty that I was about to die as I did in those moments. Eventually, as the high wore off the pain decreased, but I will be forever scarred from that experience. Since then, I've tripped once. I did two grams of shrooms but didn't trip much, and I had zero leg pain or anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today. Occasionally when I smoke weed, I sometimes get a similar but much more minor pain in my leg in the same areas. Last night after smoking some pot, I hit a friend's Bidi (disposable nicotine vape). I use nicotine vapes regularly and I am no stranger to their effects. I attempted hitting this three times. The first two drags didn't produce any vapor. So I pulled a little harder on the third hit, and suddenly felt a shockwave through my body that I have never experienced anything close to before. Muscle spasms instantly began and I felt my leg muscles contracting repeatedly without me intentionally moving them. After this, my leg began to hurt in the same areas that I felt pain during my bad trip, but in a much more painful way than it does on occasion with weed.   I was in pretty severe pain for about four hours, and although the pain has subsided mostly, my leg still feels very off today.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize if this story was disorganized and confusing, it was a very traumatic experience that is difficult for me to describe. I've very concerned that there may be long-lasting effects from the bad trip. I started using substances (weed, nicotine, shrooms, acid) about two and a half years ago, and I am contemplating stopping all of them. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? When I've researched bad trips, I haven't come across any that mention feeling very severe physical pain.

She said fuck it and was down.

That was one of the best trips of my life. She drove me around for hours that night while we blasted music and danced around in the car and cracked jokes yelled out the windows at people walking down the street and all around had a blast. She was having a blast. She was laughing, dancing, singing at the top of her terrible sounding lungs and just emanating the true vibe of a good trip. She told me she was feeding off my good vibes and that gave her good vibes which bounced right back to me.

All they do is use their phones and watch movies. Don't get me wrong, watching movies tripping is fun but it gets old fast.

Pushing aside the wasteland of empty packets and bottles that littered the floor, we gathered the ingredients for a make shift bong. 

We took turns taking hits in the still warm evening air. Harsh smoke billowing out from grinning mouths, hanging gently for a moment in the car, before dancing away with the wind. 

We descended onto the beach, the sun had just now kissed the horizon. Lighting fire to the ocean in streaks of warm milky orange. I left behind my only two possessions, a t shirt and a pair of shoes. 

I dove eagerly into the waves, the cool water was a welcome shock. Instantly washing off the hot sting of the summer evening. 

At once I felt a feeling I had never felt before. I felt the force and energy of the ocean, sucking me in and pulling me out. I felt the magnetism of the earth. Energy coalescing all around me and dispersing in a somehow gentle and forceful way all at once. 

Nature was putting on a beautiful show and I was just lucky to get caught in the middle of it. We swam for what felt like an hour. I lay on my back weightless, staring up at the sky. Which was now somewhere between orange and purple. The last moments of sun were almost finished being swallowed beneath the horizon. 

I felt like I could breath deeper, my muscles glowing in appreciation of not only the weed but from their weightless relief. In my mind the highest harmonies were sung in the quietest of tones. A breeze passed through my body as I wandered back up through the sand. To say this was to be content would be to do the word a disservice.

I just wanted to thank everyone who replied and gave help.

Last night I got a call from my friend who was on 2000ug of acid, 8x250ug tabs. He told me that the situation was a 'code red' one and that he was losing touch with reality in the worst possible way. The call happened at around 11 pm and I was on my PS4.

After receiving the call I threw on some clothes, grabbed some water and ran to go find my friend who was about a 20 min run away. When I got to him he gave me a big hug and he knew who I was and where we were.

I then got a call from my other friend, he asked me where I was and if I was with the friend who was tripping. He told me that the friend who was tripping had called him just before he called me and had asked him if he had any valium (the shit they give the dolphins at sea word to chill them out).

Me and the tripping friend walked to go get the valium which took about 30 mins to get to where we needed to be, the guy with the valium lived far and he was riding his bike down to us. On the way there the guy tripping would not let go of my hand and kept repeating ""it feels like you aren't here, you are slipping away"" and ""promise me you got me"" and ""no one can find out about this"". He kept repeating these phrases until we got to the friend with the valium.

Before he was given the valium me and the other friend discussed for a few mins if it was the right thing to do. We had this convo in private a few meters away from our tripping friends, as not to freak him out. He seemed to be getting worse and worse and he was begging for it to stop. But he was still fairly quiet at this point, he was still in touch with reality and really wanted the valium.

We knew he was on a lot of acid but we didn't want to be the people to stop him from potentially having a wonderful experience. However, we decided to give him it as he had come up with the idea on his own and it was not one we put into his head. He took 2 tablets of 10mg.

For the next 30 mins he kept asking for valium and each time we told him he had just taken it. He was asking us when it would stop and we didn't know what to say to him.

We took him to a field as he had requested this and we all laid down on the grass. He was panicking more and more and was begging for it to stop.

He then went into different thought loops but didn't really say anything too weird. Just stuff like he wants it to stop and when will the valium kick in.

THIS IS WHERE SHIT GETS CRAZY

He then said the following over and over

""am I going to die""

""why are there so many people""

""promise me i won't die""

He then started screaming from the very bottom of his lungs and running and diving about everywhere in the field. He was uncontrollable and he had no idea where he was or who he was with.

At points, he stopped screaming and wanted a hug, so we gave him one, but as soon as we did he would just grab onto us and start to screeching again.

The screams were like nothing I had ever heard, demonic like wails.

He then started running around more and more and falling and jumping everywhere. We were in a field away from anything he could hurt himself with so we let him be. We didn't want to try to restrain him so we just kept an eye on him from a distance.

He was being super loud and we didn't want anyone to call the police for them to then arrest him. We decided to call an ambulance so then if the police showed up it would have been a medical episode and not one of criminal actions.

The ambulance showed up and we all tried to take him to it but we would just thrash his arms and run off screaming that he is dead. After about 30 mins of this, the police showed up. They were unaware that an ambulance had been called and then came because someone had rung up about someone screaming in the field by their house.

After about another 20 mins of trying to walk him to the ambulance, the police tackled him to the ground, cuffed and restrained him and then dragged him to it. We watched as he was pinned to the bed.

He had no idea the ambulance had been called and had no idea he was in an ambulance or that the police had just dragged him half a mile.

We told them that he was on acid and that he was given 20mg of valium (very illegal where we live). The police took our names and that was it, they said nothing else would happen. The police drove off and so did the ambulance.

This happened last night and I have been told that this morning he was let out of the hospital and is ""out of it, in bed"" at his parent's house. I haven't had contact with him yet but I will make another post maybe.

It was honestly one of the scariest things to see.

It was kinda my psychedelic Renaissance and I did a lot last year and travelled a lot. On my most intense trip my girlfriend and I decided to trip together. I blasted her off and immediately blasted myself off. Things went fuzzy then black and I felt like that slipped backwards through a dark slide in the back of my head.
   I "" wake up "" in a dark chamber laying down almost like a padded morgue drawer. I managed to push the door open and there were metal bars on the wall outside to help me climb out. I got out of the chamber and collected myself. Looking around I could see what looked like the hallway of a highschool with no lockers just a lot of doors with little windows in them.
   I look down and I'm bare foot but still wearing my cloths. I can see someone approaching from the distance of the hall that now seems to never end and just fades into dark with a light at the end. They greet me with a feeling of welcome I can feel and a hello in my mind but no spoken word. As they get closer I can see they are wearing dress shoes, khakis, a yellow long sleeve shirt and a brown vest over it. I can't make the distinction if they are a man or woman either. Their face is obscured by a black shadowy mist around it.
   I can't remember much of what was actually said but I can remember they could hear me speak and would respond in my mind. I got the feeling I had spoken to them before.
 They start to lead me down this long hallway we were standing in and motion to the doors. At first I thought they just went to rooms but as I looked closer I noticed they lead to people's lives. Through the little window I could see many different places both indoors and outdoors could be seen through the window. People sitting alone and people with family. Like doors into everyone's lives. They told me this is how they watch us and make adjustments, But it's more for learning. We conversed a bit more and then they said it was time for me to go back. They walked me to my chamber in the wall ( still open ) and before I started to climb in said that when I go back I need to tell my girlfriend I know what she saw and that I was to not come back for a while.
   I get back in my chamber the door closes and everything goes black. I get the feeling I'm being dropped into a mold and then my vision starts to come back like a static tv screen slowly fading into picture.
   I look over at her and she's already looking at me. I tell her I know what she saw and she doesn't believe me. I tell her that they told me she would only see colors and flowers and beauty because she wasn't ready for the intensity of the full message so they had to prepare her gently. She was very shocked and almost started to cry because she couldn't believe I knew that. I haven't gone back but to this day I still wonder all the time what the heck that was.

Bit of backstory: 
I’m 18 years old and I live in the U.K.
I smoked weed once and didn’t feel anything, before I went to collage (2 years ago) and began regular smoking.
I had just got a part time job and spent lots of my money on large amounts of weed. Straight out of the gate I was smoking full grams and it was the funnest shit ever.
I managed to control my use pretty well, even though I think I was fairly dependant on it to feel good through a period of time when I was feeling pretty down, but I recognised this and I have cut down. I also had regular breaks of a month+ for tolerance.
I tried acid about a year and a half ago and have had maybe about 5 acid trips since then which were all amazing.
I stopped buying weed all together nearly two months ago and cut down to once a week maybe a month before, and now only smoke small amounts of weed about once every couple of weeks at the moment. 

Fast forward to now, In the past month I have taken 2cb (a very small amount), a couple keys of ketamine and 200mg mdma. I do not think that in itself is that much, but recently I got my mate who can order drugs off the darknet to get me some stuff.
He ordered me a gram of md, half a gram of coke and two 260ug tabs of lsd.

I am going on holiday for a week, but when I get back I will probably end up doing them as I want to try them and I feel like I really missed summer and want to have some fun. I am using the one month rule for the mdma and I’ve set the date on my phone for when I can do it again. I know lsd and mdma will not overlap and create additional health issues when combined, but I know cocaine and mdma will be extremely bad for your heart. So I was wondering how would I distribute these drugs safely over the course of two months? I was thinking mdma, wait two weeks, acid, wait another week and try the cocaine. Could I condense them even closer together without it being a health risk?

My friends are planning a camping trip soon where we will all take lsd. We were thinking of doing mdma or coke two days after. Are they too close together?

Another question is about sex on cocaine. I’ve heard varying things about not being able to get it up or it making sex even better. I assume this is something to do with the threshold dose. 

Any advice on any of this would be helpful thanks.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,697151,public,confidence,self,Am I doing to many drugs?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hyqbnl/am_i_doing_to_many_drugs/,no_ads,0.0,1595877053.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My parents were meth cooks.

The house we lived in when I was a kid had brown fuzz coming out of the walls because the nails inside were oxidizing from the chemicals in the air.


I got lots more stories AMA

E1.  Weeks after I was born my mother was arrested for possession of cocaine.  After being released on that charge she went to another state to turn herself in for a previous offense, my older sisters father; who lived in the area, called my dad and told him “she was going crazy partying and doing drugs and someone needed to come get her”.

E1.1 -  I’ve been told (by my father and older sister) that my parents got into an argument because shortly after I was born my mother left me at home in the crib while she went to the grocery store

E2.     When my sister and I were children, she was under ten and I’m five years younger, we discovered a secret room in our house.  In the room was one of those popcorn tins you get around the holidays.  Inside the popcorn was meth paraphernalia, light bulbs etc.


I remember my sister describing to my step father how to make a light bulb into a meth pipe around the same age.


E3.     My dad got shot for pulling in the wrong driveway one time, guy thought he was stealing his rabbits.  Several years later, my parents were released from prison.  My mother started using again as soon as she got out and was “dating” the guy that had shot my dad years before.


E5.  I visited my parents in the county jail many times.  I sort of spilt my time between parents.  One time I was taken to visit my father he was living in an old fallen down shack in the middle of a field.


E6.  We spent many weekends camping when I was a child.  I remember camping in the woods on our property (grew up on a 500+ acre farm), having fires with a table type apparatus over the fire with glass jars on it.

E6.1- our main thing on the farm was trees.  We had a greenhouse, and I remember it being full of 55 gallon drums of chemicals.

E7.  My sister has no sense of smell and we’ve speculated it’s because of being exposed to the chemicals from manufacturing meth.

E8.   My father began manufacturing meth in the central US in the 80s, he claims to have been taught how by a man known as “The Pigfarmer” and my father claims that the man gave him a premonition type warning about where this knowledge would lead him.

E8.1- my father also claims to have cooked a meth crystal “The size of the hood of a car, and clear as glass”.

E9.   Besides my father and my older sisters father, every man my mother has ever been in a relationship with has gone from being a decent person contributing to society, to being totally destroyed by drug use.

The prime example being my stepfather, my younger sisters father.  He was, in my eyes, the single greatest person to ever walk the earth.  He was involved in two auto accidents; I’m told caused by sleep deprivation, the second of which took his life.


E10.  In elementary school my sister and I were pulled out of class and met with two women from DFS who attempted to have a conversation with us recorded on tape.  My sister pretty much told them to turn the tape recorder off cause she wasn’t going to tell them anything.

E10.1- I remember the day I got off the school bus and the house was surrounded by police cars.  When we went inside they were destroying everything, cutting open toothpaste and breaking legs off kitchen chairs.  They eventually found a duffel bag full of white powder.  During the trial it came out that after being sent to a lab for testing the white powder was gym chalk.



E11.  When I was under five years old I remember being in a pickup truck with my parents while being chased by the police.  We eventually outran them on a dirt road.  The truck died and we camped for the night and walked out in the morning.

E11.1- one of my first memories is of a police officer yanking my mother out of a pickup truck by her hair.  That police officer would go on to be the truest officer when I was in High school.

E12 when I was young I was not welcome at many of the other children’s birthday party’s.  One time in particular, I was eight years old and a classmate had invited me to his birthday.  I walked through the woods holding his gift.  When I arrived his mother came to the door and shut it without saying anything.  My classmate opened the door soon after and told me that I wasn’t allowed in because my mother was a drug dealer, and another classmates parents had told his parents that I was also selling drugs to kids at school.  I left, sat in the woods behind his house holding the gift I had brought, and I cried; sobbed.  When I returned home and told my grandmother what had happened she told me, their parents are no better.

E12.1 - as a consequence of this the only peers I could hang out with were the “bad kids”, already in juvie etc.  and one of them is still my best friend after 20 years.

E13.  Our driveway was windy and over 2 miles.  The school bus would not come all the way out to our house.  So my stepfather and I cut a trail through the woods, from our house to the bus stop, and that’s how my sister and I went to and from the bus stop.  I was under 5 years old


E13. 1 - this house was a three story log cabin my stepfather built.  It would probably be best described as a mansion.  There was a rock waterfall inside that went from the second story to the first story with live fish, and all of the walls were hand painted murals of wilderness settings.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,697154,public,confidence,self,My story,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hyq0qt/my_story/,no_ads,0.0,1595875549.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was 20 years old on my first ever international trip with a bunch of my buddys that I grew up with and after travelling all through Vietnam we arrived in thailand. Now we had all agreed that we wouldnt go messing around with drugs while in thailand because well, they aren't exactly fond of drug use over there haha. Wake up one morning at this hostel we were staying at and my mate tells me he bought 5 tabs of acid off a skatey bald chick. Naturally we also happened to be going to a psytrance festival that night.

Obviously decided ""fuck it"" so we all drop our tab on the way to the festival. The acid took a while to kick in. Like a lpng old while to the point where im kinda coming up for what felt like a very long time.... ""fuck it lets see if anyones selling"" we walk and talk to the most obviously cooked units until we come up to this thai girl selling molly. I bought a cap and ate it and thats when the lsd really rears its head. I get on the dance floor and start cutting some shapes with one of my sober friends I'd made at the hostel and thats when the molly kicks in. I felt as though my perspective was higher then it should be but in retrospect being 5'6 from Australia I was used to being very short compared to the average height. Thailand's average height is much shorter so maybe thats why. However I then started to feel like my actual being was floating in a balla foot above me slowly swaying side to side when in reality I was in a mosh pit with a bunch of fellas moving quite erratically.

I'll always remember the look on your face.

Your pineyed smile. 

# ""Live fast, hard, and dangerous"" is what you slurred out. 

I'm sure you don't remember that, but I always will

It felt like I always was forced to watch you get fucked up. 


I'd watch you drink, we'd smoke together, hell the only reason you had enough pills to get a nod even once with your insane tolerance was because you were using me, your disabled son, to get pills. 

On top of your scripts you got the entire time you lied to me and told me you weren't getting ""what you needed"". While you had your eldest son bringing home a suitcase filled with NSAID/caffeine cut opioids from his study abroad trip to Ireland. While you had your ""apocalypse stash"" of decades worth of your stashed scripts.

You know what's funny, by the time I was removed from the house by police, that box didn't have a lot of bottles with your name on them, but for some reason it had a lot with mine. 

While you were keeping a dying cancerous dog alive, watching her wake up crying and not give her the tramadol because ""she hates the taste"". I genuinely am not sure if she kept that dog alive crying and screaming as a calculated way of getting the liquid tramadol, but she sure got 2+ bottles of it just fine. 


I don't know how the rest of my family is still under her spell. 

I have recordings where she admits to everything and sounds like an abusive maniac, but I guess gaslighting really can be that powerful. I didn't tell the cop to search the house even though I knew you had prescriptions for morphine and fentsnyl in my name in your bathroom and a fuck load of weed. 

Bitch, I watched you in one day eat an entire bottle of 30mg Morphine left behind by your own dead mother and still be in withdrawal.

I watched as  a low dose of Kratom immediately sent you into withdrawal and had you running to the bathroom shitting green. 

You'd bang on my door after midnight when I'd hide in my room to get away from seeing you so fucked up and belligerent. You'd yell through the door asking me to come smoke a joint and come out to the hot tub room. 

This isn't even the half of it. I can't believe this isn't fiction. That I didn't see sooner. 

Everyone else seemed to, as I was 13 when my girlfriends mother told me that you were not just using painkillers to manage pain. 

Drinking on painkillers, which you did liberally and openly, is a dead giveaway. That's what countless people explained to me over the years. If I ever told you about anyone who said that, you immediately began a campaign of personal attacks and sly, manipulative bullshit to try to get me to stop talking to them. Hell, you immediately hated my ex in college when you found out I actually asked her if she would bring home pills from her trip to Ireland, which you said offhandedly when I was sitting in your bed watching TV with you. 

Some nights I wonder what would have happened if I had never rolled you over.

I can only guess that the reason you went off the deep end was the pills you stole from me. Your supply was nothing compared to what it was when you were able to coach and manipulate me into getting a mountain of opioids, benzos, and muscle relaxers. So it's a useless thought experiment, because you only got to the deep end because I happened to be disabled and also your son

Maybe if I had just let you sleep on all those nights I came into your room and rolled you over and saw those glazed over pineyes, this would be easier. 

Everyone would've stopped believing the lies. Your narcissistic bullshit wouldn't work anymore. I'd look at my brothers and sisters, friends and family, and tell them ""I fucking told you so"" and hope they come out of this spell without her here to manipulate them. . 

Not much would've changed.  You were already dead to me by the time I left that hellhole of a drug house, so I wouldn't be mourning your loss any differently.

He’s 22. He’s been using Xanax to the point his tolerance level over the past 7 or 8 years leaves him uncomfortably sober after 3 bars. He’s purposefully getting pressed fent in the streets. Snorting a roxy 30 before pouring up 3 lines of that lean is just a great way to get moving in the morning apparently. He’s hooked on drugs itself regardless of the substance. Ketamine always on deck for him anything that stops the pain even for a moment is a great idea in his book. He’s a fucking mess to say the least. Let me back up and say, yeah he’s your typical junky backstory. We had a shit childhood. I’m much older than him and while he didn’t get the physical beatings from my parents, nor did he have even a remotely similar upbringing his childhood was in no way nice. He was passed along as our parents split. Tossed to the side and used as a pawn. Moved from house to house and country to country. He was given too much freedom and money and zero love. I get that, fucking believe me I do. My sister of all people introduced him to the world of drugs. She’s the middle child, a few years younger than me and apparently just old enough to know about seriously heavy drugs and their wonderful numbing effects. I digress, my point is, he’s gone. I’ve not spoken to anyone but my brother in years from my immediate family. No clue how anyone else is doing, and couldn’t care any less. They are horrible disgusting manipulative monsters. My brother on the other hand is such a lost soul. I’ve been trying to keep tabs on him, casual conversation. I do as many “welfare checks” as possible but we live 1200 miles apart so facebook chat and FaceTime has to suffice. So he visits me this past week and after I pick him up from the airport and he’s traveled the sky with seriously dangerous drugs. Stealing from the airlines liquor mid flight. He’s got roxy molly lsd lean weed and some shots he took off the plane. The fuck... anyway. We get back. We chill, he’s great for 24 hours... now the drugs are gone. He proceeds to spend 3 days sleeping or outside in the rain in the field on the phone. Come to find out that his car was stolen in broad daylight not 72 hours before arriving with pounds of weed in the car and other “stuff”. He was in a drug area, you guessed it buying pills, and he chose to leave the car running in the street and while his back was turned the car was taken. I know your thinking he had insurance and it’s registered. It’s not.  To make things easier on himself he then went into a tailspin of emotions and lost his business partner and girlfriend in one tantrum. Fast forward to the last day of the trip and when we review his flight he’s got a layover. He’s makes connections upon connections to get linked with a friend of a friend to get fucked up for his layover...how the fuck can I help him? I’ve been supportive. I’ve shown him love, time and compassion. I was hard on him when he needed it too. I’ve given him every angle possible but he’s not ready to be clean. I’m worried that the depression he has will kill him if he was sober and that why he’s always high as fuck... but the drugs are doing that even faster... he’s my baby brother and I want him happy, safe and healthy.

On my phone so it will be brief. Happened beginning of the year.

Took 7x230ug tabs. I’m fairly confident the dose was what I was told, I’ve fairly experienced with psychedelics and an experience from 1 of these tabs checks out with my previous 200ug trip.

Basically got about 10 minutes of time to prepare myself, immediately started coming up rapidly at 15m, by 30m I was quite frankly gone. Had to basically drag myself from the toilet to my room, and would literally get immediately distracted and sucked in by any somewhat significant object I.e window pattern, guitar, plant. Made it to my room and decided I need some music ASAP so decided to listen to Robert Rich’s latest release at the time - Tactile Ground. Highly recommend if you are after a deep yet gruelling, immersive musical experience.

The music consumed my being the second it came on. I checked the running time of the album and turns out to be a 2hr epic so I knew I was in for a ride.

The next 2 hours consisted of a roller coaster of what seemed to be every emotion possible in the spectrum of emotions to the deepest degree. Some sections of the album would have me feeling shrivelled and weep, curled up And begging. Then I would be thrown into moments of bliss and appreciation, then regret and doubt, courage and euphoria. Some sections would be excruciatingly painful and I would be in between maniacal laughter, disgust, enjoyment feeling as if I was being tickled in an impossibly ticklish spot, while swearing the most evil shit you could think of at Robert Rich. 

At the peak of the album I look up and see some kind impossible light-structure materialise just above me. Pure light, cross dimensional colours, seemingly infinite dimensional and beyond beauty. I truly thought I saw god reaching out of thin air. I then close my eyes and feel energy beaming from my body, and all I could see was Vegetas face looking at me, telling me I can do it, I can get It. In that moment I realised exactly what a super sayian really is. I learned something else from that point. It’s hard to explain what. I’m not saying I believe in god but I got a very good look at “it” and the magnificence of everything. The ultimate present moment, pure unadulterated existence, or whatever you want to call it.

I then spent the next 4 hours lying down on the grass looking at the sky, soaring through thought and emotion, sporadically laughing every so often while listening to Wardenclyffe Tower by Allan Holdsworth, a jazz fusion masterpiece.

Then I hit some nangs and that was pretty weird.

My favorite is the one that’s gets me hella hard which was an Alpine Vapor Sativa disposable oen, and my entire body felt like bliss with increased sensation, sensitivity, touch. Took it right before bed too so I was basically rolling around in bed listening to music. 

That was from a sativa, which I thought was supposed to make you energetic or creative? I definitely was seeing colors in my mind but I wonder what would an indica do for me? Just want to make the right investment, so any advice on the strains of pen would be appreciated.

Long story short, smoked weed 2 months ago and had a 8 hour long panic attack. Next day I was alright, however experienced heavy DR which lasted for two weeks. I was doing fine however.

6 weeks ago DR came again and this time I freaked out and had a panic attack. Since then I’ve had depression and anxiety. The anxiety is crippling, it’s constant and won’t let go at all. Insomnia hits badly. It’s like my reality has changed and the world isn’t the same anymore.

DR/DP was bad the first weeks however have subsided for the most.

Anyone having experienced the same? It feels like a permanent thing.

I went to a short term rehab for about 40 days and came out just hating myself. Eventually I learned not to pity myself so much or feed into my negative thoughts. After rehab I found out my grandpa had cancer, he ended up moving in with me and my family so we can take care of him and he just died last month, but while my family was taking care of him I had a very big moment of weakness and I stole a bottle of Oxycodone he had been prescribed. I took it all before my mom found out (bless her for putting up with all my bullshit) and once she did she didn’t even punish me or even reprimanded me. After that the most brutal wave of guilt washed over and made feel like I was living in a big cosmic joke because I spent the whole first half of my high school career wishing my mom would just leave me alone and not care and when I finally got what I wanted I felt like shit. After I got caught I asked her if I could go to therapy so we found a therapist and I went but didn’t enjoy it (not that you’re necessarily supposed to enjoy therapy) so I bitched at my mom saying I hated it and didn’t wanna go again and of course she gave me what I wanted. After that I decided that I wanted to be better and in doing so I’ve stopped all drug use (except weed cause I don’t feel strong enough to completely stop) and I’ve started grinding online school. My mom seems very happy with me right now which makes me happy but I just don’t know what to do with this constant boredom and feeling that I’m unfulfilled.

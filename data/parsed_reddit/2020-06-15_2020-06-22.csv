So I  finish rolling the blunt and a dude comes out of nowhere front eh complete darkness and starts talking to us about the stars and space and like meaning of life and shit. He started asking us what’s the brightest start and shit, and we pointed at the brightness one in the sky and points at one which is clearly not the brightest which was funny. He started talking more and more about stupid shit like how there are a “million storm troopers who are black and a million who are white with black ones having red stars and the whites ones having black stars on there helmets. He also continued to switch topics kinda quickly but like somehow he believed that they adhere all connected and it sounded like he actually knew what he was talking about which entertaining to listen too because the shit he was saying was Outlandish. He also said how he was shooting a dude 12 times with a shotgun and how the Bible and god and everything was so important in life and would continue saying many things about god. He than asked to have the blunt with him so we were like ok I guess because it be a little awkward if we said no after getting “meaningful life conversations” from him so we didn’t really think much of it. He continues on about really random and weird conversation whenever he hit the blunt he sounded like he was having a heartache he would cough so much including one time where he had to walk away and like spit up. Than my two friends get up and skate but by the time I wanted to go get up he comes right next to me and starts staring at me in the eyes having a full on staring contest. The man starts casual conversation kind of while talking to me. He said that he is my father figure and that I am like a son to him.left that conversation and started saying numbers and like trying to connect them like to football players and other things this was the first number he kept saying 10 and how it connected with one of the connections being Eli manning idk. He went on saying more random numbers and would ask me to repeat one of them that he said. The two time I apparently got it right and it was good or cool but the third time I got it wrong and apparently to him that was not chill and started saying how he would punch somebody in the face or something. So I apologized to him and he said nah you okay I’m sorry about that. So than randomly this dude says “I use to cum in girls mouths but now I started watching stream porn so I cum in my own mouth so I just started cumming in everyone’s mouths” I was pretty shook by this statement and said “pause bro” and he actually agreed and said it “you right that is pause” So we continued to somehow get off that topic and kind of change what he was saying. But he than explained to me about K2 so I asked him what it was and he was talking about Ketamine and started saying how he gets lots of it all the time. And to be honest that kinda explained a lot because his pupils where very large and he was saying some crazy shit. My friends came over and this gave me my opportunity to stand up and skate away because he was now focused on them. I skate away and tell my two friends that we gotta leave this dude crazy so we get our stuff while this guy walks away. He comes screaming asking us “DO YOU KNOW WHAT I JUST THOUGHT OF” and we all said no and he said something about how we are chill I believe I honestly forget because I was trying to leave.

Hi everybody! This is my first time posting in a forum and I’m looking to try and explain my first DMT trip so I can get feedback if possible. I’ve done acid a handful of times (never had any super crazy trips) and a small dose of shrooms and also microdosed each one before if that information is helpful for this story. This happened this past Saturday while I was at my friends house. I want to note I had taken a 30mg instant release adderal the previous day and hadn’t gone to bed yet when I did the DMT around 5:30am the following day with not much food in my stomach if that matters. We packed the bowl with tobacco, then the DMT, then more tobacco. I also don’t know how much I took since I trusted my friends dad whose been doing it for years. I did some research on DMT months prior when my cousin told me she tried it. I was interested in doing it but it never ended up happening. Forwarding to Friday night, my friends dad extracts it himself and asked us if we want to do it. I wasn’t sure and had to think about it but eventually I decided to do it. I was in my friends bed with comfy pillows and a blanket on me when I smoked it. I didn’t have any negative thoughts and was just really curious how this was gonna go. Her dad held the bowl and lit it for me (I heard a rig is the best way). I hesitated at first because I heard the taste is foul but I finally took my first hit, but I don’t think I hit it as long as I should’ve (I was trying my best). I held it in for maybe 15-20 seconds and when I blew it out my vision turned kaleidoscope like but it was very faint. I went in for the 2nd hit and inhaled a little longer than before until it really started to hurt my throat. When I blew out that hit, I looked at my friends dads face and his eyes looked black (not scary) and his face was sort of alien like. He told me to take one more and when I looked down at the bowl it was just these amazing colors on it and everything was so vibrant and bright. My friends dads face was made up of thousands of tiny boxes (looked pixelated almost) mostly the colors orange and blue. I don’t remember taking the last hit. I didn’t go anywhere I don’t think, but I also couldn’t see the surrounding I was in. I saw nothing. Then I heard her dad say “keep hitting it, keep hitting it” and I kind of snapped back but I still wasn’t in my friends room. It’s like I lost track of time and spaced out into nothingness. I started to wonder how long I’ve been taking the last hit for so I took my mouth off it but I don’t remember exhaling. I was gone. Apparently I said something like, “I have to go somewhere now, I’ll be back”. I had an eye mask on top of my head and I don’t know if I ever got to pull it down (My friends dad suggested that my eyes should be covered). What’s confusing is I had no visuals. When I was present in the room I sure did but when I “left”, I saw nothing! In the very beginning I might’ve seen some shapes and colors but nothing at all like I’ve read about and I’m not even sure that really happened. I don’t remember hearing noise either, I know some people report that. I felt really overwhelmed and said out loud, “I think this is a little too much for me”. My friends dad said I need to calm down and to let the drug takeover and this’ll be over soon (not his exact words). I felt a wave of calmness for a couple of seconds but then I began to feel uneasy again. It was so intense for me and I began to wonder if I had done too much. I convinced myself that I indeed did and then I heard my friends dad say “Stay calm, stay calm”.  When I heard him say that I thought he was trying to soothe me while an ambulance was coming to the house or something because I was so messed up. I began thinking about how disappointed my dad would be and also thought about my job briefly. Then I felt like this was going to last forever and I was stuck. For what seemed like a while, I forgot how to form words/sentences, I didn’t know any language and didn’t know language even existed. I had no thought process either. I was just blank. I was getting pretty scared and I was trying so hard to remember my friends name and her dads name so I could call out for help. When I finally remembered her dads name I called out for him and asked him how long it’s been and that I’m not having a good time. He replied with “Its only been a few minutes, everything will be ok”. I took that answer and was ok maybe for a second but the panic returned and I said again that this is not fun and I want out. He said the same exact thing as before telling me it’ll be ok and I kept begging for him to help me, that I couldn’t take it anymore. He had the same reply again and this “conversation” went on for what seemed like FOREVER. I kept begging and he kept saying the same exact thing over and over and over again. I thought I was losing my mind. At one point I could hear the desperation in my voice and said something like, “Everything is not ok! Please help me get out of this, you said you’d help me! Why aren’t you helping me?!” Almost crying. Side note: Prior to doing this he said if I was able to let him know I was having a bad time he would comfort me until it was over. I finally remembered my friends name and called out her name but I got no response. For some reason I said, “Ashley is my friend” to which her dad replied “I know”. That went on for longer and I think I was starting to come back to reality because I remember sighing and feeling my face on the pillow, I was so defeated from going back and forth with her dad and was giving up. Eventually I saw my friends room again and her dad. The room was pretty colorful and vibrant but everything died down quickly back into the kaleidoscope vision. He asked how it went and what I saw. I told him I saw nothing and it was terrible. I said, “Weren’t we talking, didn’t you hear me tell you I was scared?” He said we had no conversation. For a while it was hard to talk about what happened. I think it was shock, me trying to understand WTF just happened, and also regaining my knowledge of the English language lol. I apologize for the very long story, I wanted to make sure I provided as many details as possible. I guess my only question is, how come I saw nothing? All that went on was me feeling very overwhelmed but I don’t know what I was overwhelmed with. There was nothing to look at, nothing to hear or think about that would set me off. You’re supposed to see/hear unspeakable/indescribable things and I did not experience that whatsoever except for in the beginning before I left my body as I said earlier. I know you can open your eyes during DMT sometimes but I wasn’t in my body at that time or even knew I had a body so that wasn’t an option. Hopefully I explained this well enough.

I also have a bad tooth infection that started before the gallstones, so when that pain got too much to bear, I took a hydro/ace and my mom brought me to urgent care. I was in a pretty good mood for a few hours after taking it, but after probably hour 3-4, I was depressed and extremely sensitive. I was on FaceTime with my boyfriend, and just about every few minutes, something he said made me either cry or want to cry, whether it was because I took a joke wayyy too seriously, or his tone of voice was *mean* (it wasn't) or because he ""yelled at me"" (he definitely did not.)
I was also very, very sleepy all of a sudden.

I thought it was because before I took the hydro/ace and went to urgent care, I think I had a nervous breakdown, not because of the pain, but the amount of pain was definitely the breaking point to way too much stress. I've had one before that had me hospitalized, so I'm familiar with how they feel, which is why I'm pretty certain that I had one.

But a similar thing about again, but with a different narcotics. At urgent care, my mom td them that I wouldn't take the other pain meds because they're narcotics, and asked if they could prescripe me something with a less chance of addiction, so they gave me Tramadol.
I took one the next day and again my mood was really good for a few hours, but at about hour 3-4, I started getting super agitated, angry, and short tempered. Like wanting to bash someone's head in because they did something like purposely talk over me. This isn't new to me, but it usually only happens when I've been severely depressed and paranoid for weeks, which I hadn't been at the time. By hour 5, I was once again very depressed, and extremely sensitive, and very, very sleepy all of a sudden.

It's weird because this sounds like things people deal with during addiction withdrawals, but I know I'm not addicted because I don't feel the need to take more unless I'm in a lot of pain. I don't have any physical or mental urge to take another of either pill.
So could this be normal side effects from it?

My theory is that since pain pills release serotonin (if I remember correctly), so it could be that I get a lot of serotonin during the first few hours, and when it starts to wear off, my serotonin levels are unbalanced, similar to how people with bipolar disorder will ""crash"" after a manic episode.

Unfortunately my parents are home on friday and saturday, so we can’t just smoke bud or something else. And we also really wanna get high on something.

So these two tabs of lad and two caps would be perfect, but are these drugs easy to act sober on for the first time?

It’s both our first time, for both drug, so would it be easy for us to act “normal” on the drug. We will be doing after my parents go to bed, so around 11ish.

What will also be best for sleeping? Will we need some rest after a night out on tabs or caps?

Hours later into the day I say Ive sobered up but I still feel a slight tigness in my chest and head. The shit I saw and learned that I haven’t motioned bc this shit is too long was wild. I still feel like a slight “film” of that reality coating my brain and my eyes and whenever I close my eyes I can see some slight CEVs. Im not sure whether I should seek medical attention or just deal with it. I assume that Id be alright because Im fairly new to drugs and Im a pretty average in shape body due to sports with friends. So I thought, if all these other people are doing this stuff for years that Id be alright but still kinda worry. Anyone else had this happen to them? Yall think I dosed a lil too high?

Basically i had been binge drinking with a bunch of mates intending to go to town later.

I then did mdma oblivious to harm reduction.

I did a half dosage to a full dosage at 6:30 again at 7:30 and then again 10:30 then we went to town. I was fine and thought the mdma wasnt kicking in, so i decided to take another fulle dosage before the first club.

It then started to kick in and i felt great partied, and then i dont remember anything after that. 

3-4 hours of memory gone, apparently it was obvious that i was fucked but i was still walking around, talking, behaving myself, my pupils were changing sizes also.

The next thing i remember it was 2:00 am and we were back home chilling. 

So about 3 1/2 hours lost.

Im pretty sure i did 2-3 doses of mdma.

Is it possible i have caused brain damage, my biggest concern.

I may have overheated in the first club from dancing but im pretty sure i spent the rest of the night outside, which is -1 degrees celsius and did drink some water.

All was going fun and everybody was enjoying themselves until about 2am when half of the people left and it was me and four others. 

One of my friends had bought mushrooms and we all decided to take some and chill out watching spongebob. I’ve never done mushrooms before but I have done LSD before so I kind of knew what to expect. 

Four of us were fine, but one of my mates had a bad trip and I can’t stop thinking of what happened. It started about 2.5 hours into the trip. He went psycho. You could not understand what he was saying, he was crawling on the floor waving his arms screaming and shaking. And when I mean screaming, it was so loud and uncontrollable that noise complaints were called in by my neighbours. I tried everything I could to calm him down but you couldn’t not talk to him because he wouldn’t respond and just looked at you in the eyes and scream. He also was just repeating the same words and half of it wasn’t english. 

By this stage I was on the come down. I panicked and put him in the garage while I tried to think of what to do. He was breaking stuff and eventually two others and I decided to call the ambulance out of desperation as his condition wasn’t improving after a good 45 minutes. 

The police came ten minutes before the ambulance due to a noise complaint by neighbours and helped out a lot. They pinned him down to the floor (nicely and controllably) so that when the ambulance came they could do their work without being harmed. The ambulance gave him ketamine and took him away for the night. There was no police record or statement needed. 

I can’t get the vision out of my head of him screaming and waving around breaking things and the police pinning him down. I just keep thinking of it. How can you expect a night of drinks to turn into such a disaster.

I'm new to this, so I'll just go ahead and say what I have to say. 

I'm coming to terms with the fact that I'm addicted to drugs, and that I need to stop. Long story short I've been offered a dream job which will require me to take a drugs test involving a sample of hair. This job doesn't start for over 6 months but the drugs test could be at any time before that. All I need is some support/guidance/advice on how to avoid taking anything until that day comes.

I know it'll be detectable in my hair for up to three months and if that happens then so be it. But if anyone can help me get past that three month mark clean, I'll be forever grateful.

I've started by throwing away every drug I have on me, just need some help in ticking the days off.

Thanks in advance.

Hey, had a relatively mediocre trip yesterday ingesting 2 x yellow batman's (probably about 24mg overall) 

For some context I've got a decent bit of experience with a fair few psychedelic drugs but predominantly high doses of LSD and 2CB.  So, I went into the trip confident.  Its worth noting that I always used to insufflate it which is said to be quite a potent comeup.

Well, I began feeling the effects within ten minutes - bizarrely early, but hadn't eaten for 5 hours or so so whatever.  It just began as shivers up my neck and brightening colours.  Proper effects kicked in over the next 30 minutes and the bodyload started FUCKING ME UP.  This is weird cause I usually don't mind bodyload that badly but this was physically painful and felt like having flu.  I had an uncomfortable pulling pain searing from my rotator cuffs and aches all down my body.  The discomfort of the comeup was comparable to when I insufflated 50mg and seemed totally disproportionate.  I also vomited after this 30min and might not have gotten a full dose as it was visible (lol ew) the nausea was very powerful although I drank ginger tea and sipped cold water.

Additionally I never, ever have comeup anxiety usually and always dive into an experience super excited to trip.  This time I was severely doubting myself from the minute I began coming up thanks to the sudden comeup and bodily pain.  I had a pretty shitty headache to go with it after a couple hours. 

My fiancé's trip was kind of ruined by nausea too so we just watched some movies and waited for it to die down.  I was left scratching my head as to why I'd felt so weird.  Then I got a familiar cramp and sensation and up I shot... 

FUCKS SAKE.  OBVIOUSLY.

Paying attention to your cycle is super helpful for times like these, girls.  If I'd paid attention to my body's signs beforehand (feeling grumpy, weed not working as well, nausea, insomnia, joint aches) I'd have totally predicted the insanely uncomfortable time I had and waited a couple of weeks.  Fortunately my body was kind enough to wait til I'd come down but I'd have had a pretty dire time if it hadn't lol.

Due to rule 4 or 5 I think I can't say what I was using as well but I had 2 monsters a redbull and 7 units of alcohol 

I have a reliance on drugs it's unfortunate but I started so young I could be hospitalized if I stop (I had to stop for 6 months and some days I felt like I was going to die there and then but my parents dont know so I had to push through) 

My trip lasted about 6 hours and first I saw a werewolf in a tree eyeing me up and I threw it some bread (real bread from a bag) and it scurried away after. Then I saw this frog 3ft wide by another tree and I was like fuck me thats a chonky boy. I look away and look back and this thing is like 14ft tall trying to eat me and I grabbed this log out the raging fire barehand and threw it full force at its head and it shrunk back down to 3ft and scurried off. Then this fat tabby cat came up to me and I was petting it thinking it was a real cat because it was so lifelike and it looked like I had fur on me and this thing looked me dead in the eye and said ""thanks mate my names andrew"" in the voice of a 40 year old American who smokes 3 packs a day and I stood there in silence while he toddled into the bushes. Ozzy Osbourne also came to say hi but that was just a friendly visit lmao. By that time its 12 and the werewolf is back and he is angry. I'm a fighter I've trained judo, muai thai kickboxing, wrestling and boxing so I slapped him about no problems. Then I turn my back and I'm blacked out and go to this cartoon world with a talking alarm clock with a face a screwdriver and a giant toilet singing a song. 2 hours pass and I wake up and go to bed. 

My tolerance is very high and I took enough to kill a small horse or kock out 2 which is a decent amount for me and I didnt have a comedown or hangover but the point I'm making is not everybody can do that and you shouldnt.

It has very little body load but is still very potent. I believe it’s long duration can almost definitely result in a life changing psychedelic experience.

I’ve never been so relaxed and felt at such peace on a psychedelic before, while euphoric it’s tranquility and relaxation is definitely its main selling point. If your into meditation this is the psychedelic most suited to it in my opinion. Friends who saw me on it fought I just seemed very stoned as I just came across very laid back although I had no issue walking for hours through the woods. I tried Ganesha after I took 35mg orally in the woods before returning home and riding out the rest of the trip in my bedroom and I had no issue sleeping after the trip ended

After using Ganesha I changed my principles and stopped dealing heroin, coke and other hard drugs, it’s changed my outlook on life dramatically and has become my favourite psychedelic. It was also very hard to obtain, I spent the whole of are groups drug dealing synthesis budget on trying to synthesise some of Shulgins chemicals. I ended up having to finance it out of my own money and the chemists after running into various problems finally successfully synthesised it. The precursors were apparently very hard to find but the slow progress was more down to inexperienced chemists.

Also I do have reasonable psychedelic experience with DMT, HOT-17 and going up to 800ug of LSD and I highly recommend Ganesha

Today I thought about many of you, dear readers, who have been addicted to marijuana, tobacco, alcohol, greasy food and other related shit, causing you to get weak, sleepy, angry, unhealthy or whatever bad life status. I'm sure it is really hard for you to get ride of your addiction/s?

Maybe I'm too old... More than the half of my life have been high, under the effects or just having bad habits for my health, I only hope any of you to learn something from my experience, or at least think about that:

1) Marijuana: I started to smoke marijuana when 15yo. I have been smoking lots, thousands, of joints every single day of my life, when studying, when working, after breakfast, just before sleeping... I thought I was addicted to marijuana, but it was a lie! Just stopped to mix tobacco and my addiction dissapeared. I was just addicted to tobacco, and smoking weed-only helped me to stop smoking at all. It could be harder to stop using tobacco when you smoke derived from marijuana, like hashish, so just try to change to marijuana first, anyway it will be healthy for you. 

2) Alcohol: I started to drink alcohol when 13yo. I have been drinking (thousands of gallons of) beer and wine, at every lunch and dinner, and also as a breakfast, and having harder mixtures at night, every single day of my life, going drunk for an exam, and for working. Thought I was addicted to alcohol, but it was a lie! I started a ketogenic diet, having only dry alcoholics like gin, vodka or whiskey, and my addiction (slowly) disappeared too. I was just addicted to sugar and carbohydrates, and a strict low carbohydrate diet helped me to be a casual-social drinker, no more hangovers, never more vomit or being out of me.

3) Greasy food: I started eating greasy food when... 6yo? And I have been worried about obesity since I'm 16yo. Never a thin boy but always trying to get ride of greasy food, and taking lots of ""healthy "" but high carb foods like potatoes, rice, pasta or fruits instead of fat. Thought I was just a fatty boy, but it was a lie! Ketogenic diet also help me see fats are not bad, you are a fat boy cause you eat too much carbohydrates. Think about paleolithic men diet, we have the same constitution, but we feed with carbs, causing our muscles to work with glucose. A ketogenic diet make your body work with ketones, and the feeling is awesome after adapting.

I'm sure many of you have a lot to discuss about what I have say about my single experience, but I'm glad to help and to debate about this. My conclusion as an old junkie is that we all are being deceived, and many drugs are not the real problem.

So, 80mg down the hatch, along with a couple cups of coffee and an ungondly amount of nicotine - a cocktail which normally activates beast mode and turns me into an absolute productivy machine. 

2.5 hours later, nothing. I had my doubts going in, because I had taken some pretty high doses of stimulants on several occasions in the last few weeks, including a couple adventures with some Benzedrex inhalers, but I didn't expect such a downright disappointment. 

I've been experiencing some peripheral stimulation - higher blood pressure, muscle tension and jaw clenching - but no mental effects aside from increased wakefulness. No analysis enhancement, no razor sharp focus, no cognitive euphoria. Usually I'm fairly sensitive to the effects of stimulants so this is new for me. My ADHD symptoms are still very prominent. 

I remember a few months ago when just 30mg would make for a remarkably productive and fulfilling day. Now I've more than doubled that dose and feel unaffected. 

If you have a low tolerance to stimulants then take advantage of that and keep it that way. Don't start frequently abusing them in high doses and drain yourself of all those lovely neurotransmitters. Needing a minimum daily dose just to reach your normal, baseline mood, concentration and energy isn't fun. 

I had been fasting when I dosed, so maybe some protein will help kick things into gear. I also have weed. I may smoke a bowl or two and see if the cannabis poteniates the stimulants or vice versa. I'll report back the results

So for the past couple months of this pandemic I've been dropping a tab of acid every 2 weeks, mainly as a way to keep my mental state up and keep boredom at bay. I only take one tab (\~125ug) and so far every single trip has been normal and uneventful.

&amp;#x200B;

However, after this most recent tab I keep finding myself in this weird, almost manic state. Focus-wise I feel great, and my energy levels feel higher than normal too. I've been going to the gym, and reading a shit ton, but for some reason there's this weird feeling I've had my stomach this whole time since the last trip, giving me a vibe of ""I kinda feel like I'm going a little crazy"". Obviously I don't believe I'm actually going to have some sort of mental breakdown, but nonetheless there is definitely something that feels a little off.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone experienced something similar to this?

Could the fact that I also haven't smoked weed since this trip (typically a daily smoker) be playing  a role in this?

Edit: Also probably should mention I have no history of any mental illness in either side of my family, so I doubt that this is some genetic thing that the LSD is causing to pop up early.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,687976,public,confidence,self,Feeling slightly manic after a pretty typical acid trip?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hdcrtn/feeling_slightly_manic_after_a_pretty_typical/,no_ads,0.0,1592796134.0,Psychedelics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, as you’d expect, my heart rate has been quite elevated for a while, values mostly around 130-140 bpm, but it did go up to around 160 bpm briefly.

Now, I took the watch off for it to charge for a while, and when I put it back on, I got several drastically lower readings, we’re talking several readings around 65-70 bpm for a few minutes straight.. then back up to 150.

So.. Should I care? Worry at all? Watch out for anything?

For some background, I have been going (still am somewhat, just other issues) through some rough physical health problems, mainly a severe electrolyte imbalance and malnourishment, which for a very brief moment affected my EKG readings (actual EKGs, not the Apple Watch one) that I just got told the other day should be be pretty much in the clear now.

I basically stayed up for about two weeks and let my psyche go to shit. This happened, I documented it as soon as I was capable, and posted it. I actually look back on it now as quite entertaining.




First sequence:

I’m just at home tweaking a heavy bit. Haven’t had much sleep at all in over two weeks which brought on a different psychotic episode just a few days prior. I still live with my mom(well not now since I literally just kicked out) and I was starting to act a little out of whack already by the time she went to bed. She laid down and was talking on the phone with her friend, my sister, or whoever and was talking about how crazy I was becoming. I listened in on her conversation like I do often cause I’m a tweaker and she finally realized my eavesdropping habit. The person she was talking to suddenly transformed into my brother in law and so I used my eavesdropping and super hearing in my room and listened in there. I would listen to the things she said and then I would respond by typing it as a message but not sending and somehow she saw it. She started to get freaked out that I could hear her and make out everything being said all the way in my room. 

So she, my brother in law, and my sister, on a three way call thing I guess, logged onto my Facebook and started digging through my messages. As they kept on reading I got more and more pissed off but I didn’t confront them directly because I was suspicious that my hearing wasn’t so super and I was hearing everything wrong. I decided to type unsent messages to them and wait for them to freaked out enough to come say something to me about it. This started a game of “see who will finally break out first”. I started to get a little crazy and demonic with what I would say in referring to my super hearing and that really began to freak them out to where they thought I was some kind of demon spawn and I needed to be baptized and saved.

After a while of doing whatthefuckever they still hadn’t come forward to me and just kept reading my private messages and ignoring me which made me wanna grab some attention and type up a few statements about doing meth and how long I’ve been doing it. This was completely unknown to my mom and she found out she was pissed the fuck off as expected. I had a gram with me that I had just bought and had not touched. I pulled out the bag and was actually prepared to make up a shot but I wanted to taunt my mom with it a little more. She wasn’t having it and said that I can either give her the bag of dope or she’ll call the cops. Game on.


Second sequence:

I decide to challenge her thinking she wasn’t really gonna call the cops. She makes the call but I’m half believing it to be bullshit and she talked to nobody. I stood in my room prepared to make up a shot but that’s when they started to arrive. I learned from last psychotic episode a days prior the signs to distinguish real life from hallucinations. They would show up on the porch and shout that they were the police and to let them in. However they did not knock on the door(my hallucinations don’t have the ability to knock). When they would walk
towards my room, I would hear their voices and footsteps except they weren’t loud enough and had a fake energy about them. They’d get to the door but not open it and when they walked down the hallway it sounded like they had sleigh bells attached to them and you’d hear the ringing. 

They kept coming in rounds. One after one, my mom would get up to
answer the door and they would walk to my room entrance then disappear. I would stand in my room with the bag in my mouth and water in hand, ready to swallow the dope when/if needed. Everytime they were found to be imaginary until my mom said that this time
she had called them for real but and they were coming my way. 

The real ones had shown up at an unknown time but instead of walking in the first time they would stop at the door and ask if I had I swallowed it or if I wanted to go ahead and give the back up to her. So some new acquaintances, who I’m almost positive weren’t real, convinced me to swallow the bag since they were due to actually show up at some point anyway. And I paid for it so of course I’m not gonna just hand it over. But the cops had asked if I swallowed it or not. When whoever told me to eat it I gulped it down and replied saying that I had swallowed it. But there stood the cops right outside the doorway who had heard me claim to it which gave me a charge of tampering with evidence. Nobody else had seen the bag. Only me. And so to them it was only a word and they hadn’t set eyes on it. So was I still be charged for tampering was
up for heavy debate. I claimed there wasn’t a bag at all and nobody else could say otherwise.


Third sequence:

Well the first bag that had half the gram but still had the other bag with the second half in it. The cops were still there, having to do a search of the house to find anything else that may be illegal. I suddenly remembered the second bag inside my pillow case and didn’t wanna have to eat both bags but felt I had no choice. Second bag down the hatch. I laid in bed having a bit of tweaked porn time when they started searching my mom’s room. The bathroom had been searched too and an old syringe cap had been found under the sink. Even though it was most definitely mine, my mom was blamed for it and was being arrested for drug paraphernalia. I felt like a piece of shit for being the reason she had to deal with the unreasonable punishment but I was also a  nervous shit storm and looked like a fucking human jackhammer with my rapid shaking. I had a tampering with evidence charge to deal with along with whatever they were gonna give me for the 20+ dirty rigs I had in my guitar case so I was pretty upset. 

Right as the cops were getting around to coming to search my room, I begin to try and argue my tampering charge. I put up a good fight but I couldn’t get a response from the leading officer, for he was behind my closed door. I get up and head towards him when suddenly my mom comes through the door. She had no handcuffs around her wrists and looked like she had just gotten out of bed... because she just did. And that’s when I snapped back to reality. My worries and angers from seconds ago were suddenly gone and realized which parts of the experience were real, fake, and kinda real but pretty fake.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,687965,public,confidence,self,My first meth psychosis journey laid out in sequences.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hdbhcn/my_first_meth_psychosis_journey_laid_out_in/,no_ads,0.0,1592791716.0,Custom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yesterday was summer solstice. I took a big handful of dried mushrooms, more than I've ever done in one sitting, and chowed down. We went to the park for the sunset. The following are fragmented memories. I was already hallucinating within about an hour. Here's what I saw:

The grass was like holographic fiberglass. Shadows of grass tufts in the fields turn to rabbits racing around, in and out of their warrens. Fractal patterns everywhere, clouds bursting baby clouds like ink diluting in water. Everything was overlayed with bee hive geometric shapes, vectors lighting a runway into the horizon, pulsing meshes of netted lines like cobwebs through the air. People's smiles would freeze in place, floating like a Cheshire cat smile. Mesmerized by my friend's hair engulfing her head, like a fury octopus. Red sparks like fire flying off from the shadows, movement tracked like long exposure footage. Breathing shadows. Omfg I was so fucked  

After sunset, we walk back. My mouth wouldn't stop talking words. I kept saying ""do you want my shoe?"", then with a massive grin, ""you can have my foot, I'm gonna take off my shoes!"", I Take off my hoodie, and run away laughing. My mates literally grabbing all the clothes I was shedding. The gibberish would not stop

My friends would have a normal chat and I'd just laugh ""he's lying, he doesn't even have a passport...Fine, I'll wear the hat, only on a Wednesday...I'm a mathematician, I can solve any equation in the world using mushrooms... Am I farting?.. Is this real? - Don't be silly...""

I got stuck in the laundry, and tried to wear my coffee table like a tortoise shell. I know that I licked things, but I do not know why.

I read the 'V' verse from 'V for vendetta', then in Sean Connery's voice

I apologised for talking gibberish, and my friend tells me I dont have to keep saying sorry; without skipping a beat I reply ""But I'm Canadian!"" - I'm not

I think most would agree weed isn’t fundamentally dangerous or “bad”. I also think most could argue that it can be used responsibly and maturely without causing negatives in your life. But there seems to be a grey area in how it can be used responsibly.

-Is responsible use limited to say once a month/special occasions 
-is responsible use limited to after work/chores/life commitments 
-or can you justify using even before things such as work/cleaning etc

I’m more asking because I was a nightly smoker, just a small joint, yet I have been told that is still heavy use and I got asked to join leaves and there people say how many benefits you’ll encounter if you completely quit eg more concentration energy etc.

I’ve taken a T break for a week, and I certainly feel like I do have slightly more focus and energy, but it’s not drastic. I don’t know whether that subreddit is for those who literally need weed to function, to get out of bed, to see people, to go to work.

I have some feelings that I need to express, somewhere and somehow... I can't really speak to anyone about this... This is just going to be my vent

I have been involved with drugs for sometime now, I have had ups and downs... I've been stupid and sensible... I have learnt a lot about myself and the world through my drug use... But it needs to come to an end... But I can't... It's getting intense... And while I have researched drugs, and how they impact the brain and try to reduce the impacts of the drug... That rule is going out of the window each time I consume

I am always looking looking for a high, and while my drug use is contained (not controlled), I am always wanting to get high... I want to be high all the time... I wish I could function, doing the things I need to do, whilst high... I have turned to drink to try and manage these feelings...

Weed doesn't do it for me, and I have turned to other things

I have not recently discovered ketamine, however, it represented a turning point in my drug consumption... I cannot simply just take one drug... My poly drug use is probably going to kill me


I cannot just take ketamine by itself, with me looking trying to get deeper, longer, and more intense k-holes

I have some sort dissociative disorder, and the moments after taking ketamine... I feel normal, I feel like a human, I feel like I am successful

I can happily and easily go through a gram of ket a night, and with anything less I turn into a ket gremlin... I would almost do anything to get more ket once I have run out in a night

It all started when I started taking ketamine and coke... Then ketamine and mdma... And now it's ketamine and anything I can get my hands on

A time ago, I took MDMA, Crystal Meth, 2-cb, and ketamine in a night

Another time, I took speed, MDMA, coke, and ketamine

My brain feels normal on drugs, and that I can do the things I want to do

However, I am currently training to go into an industry where I need to be able to effectively and efficiently use my brain... While I feel normal on these drugs, each time I use, I feel like I loose a piece of myself... The drugs make me into this unattainable person... And while I am successful in real life, drugs make me aware of that success... I feel happy in those moments

I am not addicted to a particular drug (except ketamine), but I'm addicted to the feeling of being high...

I know how poorly drugs have made me in the past, Unused to collapse at work, have no control of my thoughts or feelings, be stupid and disrespectful to people I know... I don't want to be like that, but excessive drug consumption can do that... While my drug consumption isn't frequent, it is too frequent for the life style I want to lead, and the polydrug use is getting out of hand... I am running out of drugs to experiment with

I have defined addiction in a particular way, from reading and research, and I don't fit into that... However if you said I couldn't do any drug ever again... I would rack up the biggest line of ketamine possible and hope that I won't die... That's not normal

I used to love drugs, but now I love drugs in a completely different way... And I feel like if my living situation was to change, which it more than likely will, my sense of self will deteriorate leading to excessive drug consumption

I am happy in my life, I am successful, but drugs makes it so much easier to experience those feelings... I wish I never experienced any drug, because I feel like it has changed me as a person... I crave something that cannot be achieved... I'm not lost in my life, I have direction, but that direction will be lost if I continue with this polydrug use...

TL;DR: Any advice for prolonging the effects of Ritalin? When it comes to other drugs, people say that citrus can create a more intense experience, but for THC, the opposite is (allegedly) true...is there anything like this for stimulants, or should I just look into an extended release formula instead?

Background: I'm cramming my summer semester with a metric shitfuck of work that's going to help me graduate with my psych undergrad next semester. I've been busier this summer than I've ever been in my entire life. I've had a prescription for Ritalin since around this past December, when I was (FINALLY) diagnosed with ADHD. We started with 5mg twice a day. God, I was so efficient. With life before, concentration was like having a really huge, loosely woven fishing net. Getting the damn thing in the water was hard enough, and most of my responsibilities would pass through the net, so I'd have to keep recasting it in the hopes they'd eventually find the sweet spot and come aboard the SS Productivity so I could relax with the crew (in this metaphor: my boyfriend and our cat): which was an end goal that was hard-earned most days.

But with Ritalin? The net might as well be the world's smallest colander. Cheesecloth. A coffee filter-- nay, a teabag. Instead of casting it multiple times a day, I'm tossing the net in the water once-- and it's all coming up krill, baby. I'm catching EVERYTHING. I'm talking MAD seafood exports going on. Alas, the tides turned once I built a tolerance and stuff started slipping through the net again. We upped my dose to 10mg twice a day about two months ago. This worked wonders, and I was productive for a while.

Until my course load became heavier. Now, the dose is back to being on par with a couple shots of espresso. I've started taking the doses so they overlap a bit and I can get maximum productivity, but I don't want to develop a crazy tolerance to it. I'm taking psychopharmacology courses so I'm still getting familiar with drug mechanisms, but I think anyone who knows anything about drugs knows that stimulants + time = heart attack. Now...my body is less like a temple and more like a $2 haunted house made of shipping containers and strobe lights. My family history is rife with heart conditions and I am a 22f \~110lbs who had jellybeans and an Ensure for dinner last night. I'm not fit to be a gamblin man, if you know what I mean. 

I have a really great psychiatrist, but because they know I'm a psych major, I feel like they look at me a bit harder? I might just be paranoid because I have some pretty shitty doctor experiences that have made me skeptical of medical professionals (long story) but I'm terrified of being looked at like I'm fishing for drugs; which is dumb because I of all people should understand that the job of a psychiatrist is to help their patients function in daily life? I'm not negotiating a global peace treaty, I'm asking for modifications to a drug I already take, this shouldn't make me so anxious? 

Anyway the point of mentioning that is to say that I'm considering asking about an extended release stimulant. Until my next appointment, I was wondering if there are any ways to increase the length of the duration of ritalin, such as taking it on a full stomach vs empty, or eating/drinking certain things. I know there's lore around certain recreational drugs that says citrus makes many drugs more intense, except for THC which it apparently helps eliminate? Not sure on the validity of either of these things, but yeah...anything like that for stimulants? I've had coffee with them, but it doesn't do too much in terms of prolonging efficiency, and I'd like to keep things somewhat safe when it comes to this.

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Sorry this is so long, COVID has me feeling kinda lonely and I haven't written anything that wasn't purely academic in a million years.

So Idk if this is the best place to put this but I’d like to know why exactly this happened and how to avoid it next time and maybe what I should do better when doing drugs to save yourself from reading all the details and bull just scroll down to the part when I write “to keep everything short”

So before this incident when I tripped tf out at 15 I’ve smoked before with a couple friend but I didn’t get completely high I took a couple puffs and it felt like I kinda got warped into time and I proceeded to kinda come down from this feeling didn’t smoke since then I just thought y’all should keep that in mind

Fast forward a couple years later I get a stoner girlfriend💀
So I’m at my girls house we decided before hand to smoke together because I’m like why not thought it would be a pretty good chance to bond with her she pulls out a case with 6 prerolled joints she lights it up takes a couple hits I’m like ok pass that shit I take a couple hits I don’t completely inhale I kinda just swallow it and make it come out my nose mind you I havnt really smoked before like this so I call my friend on FaceTime just because I’m like bored af I’m not high yet this guy sees me smoking and being the idiot my friend is he’s like “your not smoking it right you have to cough inhale it all the way your smoking like a pussy” he only recently started smoking and he’s calling me a pussy btw 

that’s when I lay down next to my girl and I decide to inhale half the joint because I don’t like being called a pussy as I’m sure you wouldn’t either in that situation I inhale half the joint gone and hold it in for at least 3 second till I let it go and let out a couple small coughs that’s when my girl puts the joint up and turns on music and starts to vibe couple mins later while Im like “I don’t feel shit” that’s when I’m start to get all all hyper and giggly and shit cuz I’m joking with my girlfriend like why did you put the joint away I was still smoking and she looked at me laughing my ass off at the dumbest shit and she’s like “your high” 😂 and I’m like “I can’t be it’s no fucking way”

This is when shit starts to hit the fan

So as I’m being hyper the way we both reacted to the weed I kinda started to notice it she was a bit more chill I was hyper as hell and wanted to do shit so since she was just chilling I didn’t want to fuck up her vibe or her high I kinda start to lay down on her shoulder and close my eyes to kinda see if I can match her high I guess
and that’s when time started to feel warped and I kinda blacked out and ended up on the edge of the bed and I’m like wtf just happened because I couldn’t remember what happened a couple minutes ago that’s when I started freaking out for no reason my girls like “your just high it’s the drugs” but that’s when I blacked out again and ended up in the kitchen next to her and I grab her because I was scared I hurt her when I blacked out when I say blacked out it’s holes where I can’t remember shit and she’s like I didn’t be I was so scared that I did that’s when I grabbed her and hugged her and that’s when I black out again because I closed my eyes on her shoulder that’s when I ended up in the bathroom 
She told me to put water in my face and drink some of it to wake myself up and this point I feel fucking pathetic because of the fact that I’m tripping balls in front of this girl she puts me in the shower and runs the water on me I have all my clothes on so all my shits soaked and I’m wet as hell she didn’t know wtf to do we both young
So I black out again and end up on the coach with a bunch of towels wrapped around me cold she has a chair in front of me she starts asking me questions idk why she was just trying to figure out what to do

To keep everything short and not too long

basically after me blacking out a bunch of times I started to get violent and I started to talk about religion because I felt like I was dying the black outs started to feel like time loops it started to feel like I was just repeating the same shit over and over again and thinking about it scares tf out of me it felt like I was literally in hell if you ever seen the Netflix show Lucifer this isn’t a big spoiler but it might be to some of you but one character ended up in hell and endures and infinite time loop of something shitty the character does I felt like it was god punishing me that’s when I felt like the only option was to jump out the window for some dumb reason I’m writing this so obviously that didn’t really work out but I ended up breaking my friends glass ornaments by knocking over shelves and running full speed at the window and fucking my head up I ended up with two big as knots on my forehead not too bad I didn’t feel any pain because of all the adrenaline and weed smoke in my lungs I also stepped on the glass I knocked over
 
My girl lives in a apartment complex and her mom comes in a couple minutes after the incident of me almost jumping out the window
Mind you I didn’t know wtf was going on it almost felt like I was thinking all these things instead of doing them even before them I was saying hurtful shit to my girl about last shit that’s happened in the relationship

But when her mom comes in I end up running out the room screaming “life is hell”
Because which caused a lot of problems with the neighbors eventually cops came and her mom chill af she cleared everything up with them they ended up keeping me in the bathroom away from everything else so I don’t hurt anyone or myself until I got sober

Knowing that I thought that the the creative high is the thing that I want and it is. So when I could I was always looking for sativa strain with low CBD levels. But in most of my experiences with cannabis I felt  some level of anxiety and paranoia, sometimes it grew to really unpleasant levels.

Recently I started experimenting with mixing CBD only weed and normal high THC weed and it feels so much better. Im not getting locked in the couch, still getting that creative, laughing experience that I like but the anxiety is almost completely gone.

I think that everyone has different brain chemistry and high THC weed is not for everyone, on the other hand high CBD weed is also not for everyone because you might get sleepy and couch locked-unless this is something you are looking for.

it was a friday afternoon, i walked home from school to a friends house. now i’ve been on antidepressants for maybe 3 months at this point n i had been telling myself NO ALCOHOL because i knew it would hit way more when it mixed w my pills. weed was fine tho cuz imma constant smoker. after a while we popped out the vodka n ice cream. i only drank a little, well a little for me :/ it really wasn’t much maybe 3-4 shots idk it was in a cup. anyways after chillin for a bit we call up my friends (the girls house who’s house i’m at is new to school so she doesn’t know anyone, she hung w my friends once before)

so when waiting for my friends to pick us up so we can go to a punk rock show thing, i remember my sister has two extra tabs. so i hit her up, pop the tabs and hop in my friends van. i didn’t realize how fucked up i was until i was too fucked up. the weed, alcohol, antidepressants, and acid just did NOT mix well. at the time i thought THIS IS THE BEST FUCKING TRIP and honestly it was. 

so we’re on our way to the show, i’m laying in the van n we’re outta gas soooo i whip my $50 gas card that i fucking earned and saved specifically for my friends van andddd we gas up the van

me, tripping so fucking hard, and my friend who can’t handle her alcohol, go into the gas station to pee but i can’t find it, i remember walking into the supply room tho :/

anyways that was just a side part, we go to this school football game to pick up my friends and then suddenly i’m alone.. wait suddenly i’m alone? they dropped me off. abandon me. at a random ass school??? my friends 😤 (later when i asked them why they said “we didn’t think you could handle the concert, THATS NOT A REASON TO DITCH BRO LEAVE ME IN THE VAN) 

now i’m at this random ass high school, it’s pretty close to my house tho, thank God they also ditched the girl i came with bc then i want completely alone. the shit that was going on in my head was completely indescribable. i felt like an empty beer bottle shattered into the concert, beer dripping out. i thought i was being picked up my a car and walking on the side walk. for a little it became a game, i kept dying and become different people, there was always a boy i was trying to fing but in the end i died and became myself and the boy that one that was driving the van and left me. this sounds so confusing 

i can’t even frickin describe what was going on in my head but i want to, eventually i hear a scream “YOU CANT JUST DO THAT” 

i dunno what happened but it’s dark and all i hear is “are you okay are you okay” bitch i’m okay leave me alone

welllll then i blacked out n i remember seeing light for the first time, like the rest of this story was in pitch black, now i’m in an office withhhhh my SCHOOL SUPERVISION in front of me, asking me who i am, what’s my name, did i take something. n then ofc... i see my dad in the doorway. scared? disappointed? i dunno i was just like oh fuck yoooo what’s going on, i felt like i should be scared but i wasn’t 

then i’m in an ambulance, then i’m in the hospital, someone tried sticking smth in my arm but i pulled it out n blood shot everywhere, i still have the jacket with the blood

they gave me an iv and like took my high away which sucks cuz i paid MONEY FOR THAT but they didn’t know i was trippin obviously, they thought i took an edible that was laced

at this point i’m like these fuckers are being so dramatic, like there was NO climax to this story, i got abandon and high and lost that’s basically all right?

i go into the bathroom, THEY WOULDNT LET ME GO ALONE, and i see the mirror and i’m just like FUCK

my face was completely fucked up, black eye, swollen cheek, scraped up skin. what the fuck happened, i didn’t even feel it, turns out i completely SLAMMED my whole body into the ground, on purpose, it definitely was t an accident, but because of that, they thought i was trying to kill myself sooo i got stuck on suicide watch for a little.
once i got home i felt like everything changed. my friend wouldn’t talk to me and neither would the ones who ditched me. i quite literally had ZERO idea what happened that night because i was so fucked up and no one would tell me. my family treated me like i had literally been date raped or smth 

everyone made such a big deal about it and i didn’t, it doesn’t make sense to me since they weren’t the ones who experienced it. they have no idea what was going on in my head. i still think back to it and well fuck i have no words

it was funny though trying to talk to my family when i was that fucked up, in the hospital they were like what’s the date n apparently i started listing my favorite things

everyone says i was not in control of my body, which i guess is true but i think it’s more like all my senses were disconnected. they still worked though, gosh darn explain stuff is so hard, they were connected but not connected

i could keep going on about this night but i’ll end it here cuz it’s probly already too long, it’s just a memory ive always wanted to document so ye",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,687839,public,confidence,self,a story of “the night i died” 🙄,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hd2l50/a_story_of_the_night_i_died/,no_ads,0.0,1592752355.0,Custom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, I’d say that I feel like a different person after the trip. I feel much more mature now and am a lot more caring and loving for myself. I’ve realised that I don’t need to do things to satisfy the ego. I should only do things that are beneficial to me and those that I love

I'll try to be as brief with context as possible...
I've been using xanax and valium as a self-prescribed anti-anxiety for 2 years. As of about months ago I decided working with a local detox center to reduce my intake and find new ways to cope with stress, I made a lot of progress leading up to the lockdown/covid crisis. 

On top of the world pandemic, I've been having (ongoing) issues within my family, I was already depressed... and to top it off my biggest support and reason to live, my dog of 12 years passed away last month... I saw it coming and definitely it attributed to my current state.

So about 3-4 months ago I started using LSD and ketamine a lot more and reduced my xanax/valium usage considerably.. I felt more connected to my dog and earth itself than ever, i swear it helped my depression more than xanax or any talk therapy ever could.. I was actually in a really good place just before he passed on 25 May.. 

When he died i stopped caring, i started abusing everything(to a degree, i probably nearly OD'd at least once or twice but i would never intentionally try to die.. I just drank a lot on top of the drug use in the first week, who wouldn't?) SOOO Now I've reached a point where my tolerance to every drug is so high that im taking tabs of acid and bumps of ket just to function daily (my job is very demanding atm) I take valium throughout the day to offset any anxiety, followed by like 4mg of xanax just to put myself to sleep.. then i repeat the cycle all over again.

It's no longer therapeutic, i hate to say it's turned into an addiction... I do have a holiday planned, where I hope I can force myself into a detox, and back to the center for therapy.

This has been going on for at least 3 months. Every single day is getting harder so I know that my brain is not happy with how much I'm messing with it's chemistry..I guess what I'm asking is, Has anyone done this combination of drugs for this long ..? What were the long term effects ? How fucked am I ? Haha...

Sorry for the long read, I've wanted to reach out for so long.

TLDR : Take copious amounts of lsd every day + ketamine. Also valium throughout the day followed by xanax to sleep, for 3-4 months straight . I feel it taking its toll, has anyone been stupid enough to do this to themselves and how fucked am I?

Of course I get nervous and pop a quarter xan to settle in, then drink a pint and a lil wine cause I’m anxious. This proves to be a fatal cocktail of failure and absolute humiliation.

She comes in and I offer her wine, and right down to business she’s on her knees on my nice rug carpet. I’m honestly thrilled but as I’m standing up I feel the blood rush to my head and start to feel dizzy and quite ill. She goes on like a trooper until I’m sweating bullets and my knees wobble and I topple like a damp sandcastle in the oncoming tide.

My head hits the side of my night stand, she bolts out the front door and the Eurythmics play in the background as I pull myself up off my lovely carpet.

I’ve had a couple other people try them and most people couldn’t handle the high, or they got scared on them. The effects are you see shadow people (which is what scared people) and you get an almost drunk feeling however you’re sober and they’re out of your system within 10 or so hours. So I used to pull souls out of the under world, and travel dimensions on these pills. Nobody would ever believe me about how intense they were. I could name so many crazy experiences on them, like traveling to hell then waking up the next day w burns and blisters, seeing and talking to people that were just souls, seeing the matrix ect. So last time I did them (this is what got me to quit) I tripped balls and passed out (nothing unusual) I didn’t do them for a couple days because I’d only do them maybe once every two weeks because they’re very harmful, but they were out of my system, I go and smoke wax w some buddies and in the middle of it I completely loose my vision for a solid 10-15 minutes, I even started to see a bright light like I was dying. Thought it was weird but I didn’t overthink it. The next day me and some buddies go n smoke wax again, well it happens again, this time I saw no light, but I go and take them home after I get my vision back, once we got there they said “maybe it’s the pills that are doing that” and I remember laughing and saying the word “pills” and I just started throwing up in the car out of no where, just thinking pills. It didn’t even feel like me. I get home and lay on my bed and I automatically become “possessed” and I end up talking to something that claimed it was an alien. I called my friend after I snapped back to reality, freaking out and I tried telling her the story but something grabbed me n made me feel uncomfortable about telling it, like I wasn’t supposed to. I texted her the next day and she said it didn’t even sound like me, and the guys that experienced me loosing my vision and throwing up said it was the scariest thing they’ve ever experienced and it was happening to me.

Sorry guys just toasted a joint and I tapped into my sweet ass, totally worthwhile Associate's in Creative Writing powers that have completely worked out in life!

So my grandparents are old school druggies. Grandpa himself accidently absorbed 20 hits of acid through a candy necklace when it rained at Woodstock; Grandma doing lines of coke at a Rolling Stones concert in '77. Et cetera and so on with stories of legendary drug use each more ludicrous than the last.

Needless to say this has carried down to my father and thus myself. With our own stories and adventures both together and apart. Maybe that'll be a spinoff post who knows! That joint turned into two so it only seems fair I do a second post. But that's not the subject of this one.

Today my grandparents were coming by to drop off a quarter pound of cannabis. I hadn't seen them in ~4 months due to quarantine, so I was definitely excited. I was sitting on my porch smoking a cigarette when my grandma made the turn towards my apartment. She eagerly ran up the steps as we air hugged and noticed my cigarette. She quickly asked if she could take a drag, and who am I to deny my grandmother? She tilted her head downward to hide her face and took 3 puffs as we heard Grandpa call out ""You better not be smoking a cigarette around your grandmother, I didn't plan on having to kick your ass today!""

So grandma was a nurse way back when and smoked about 2 packs a day. Eventually culminating in COPD on top of other issues later to be diagnosed as Fibromyalgia. Nothing came easier to her than quitting smoking, she probably quit a dozen times in my lifetime alone. Conversely, my Grandfather is bizarrely anti-tobacco. I myself have received countless lectures on how I'm killing myself and all my loved ones within a 12-foot radius. A valid point, nonetheless it's still aggravating. Grandma smoking was always a point of conflict between them, but that never stopped her from bumming my cigarettes at birthdays, holidays, or that summer I stayed with them when I had fallen on hard times (thanks again Associate's in Creative Writing).

Grandpa waltz's up the stairs with his 15 year old, long-haired chihuahua that has been perched on that man's arm like a parakeet since before I even knew what marijuana was. He hands me a very floral smelling, family-sized box of triscuits and went to the bathroom. Grandma and I made use of the time to catch up, gossip about the family, and take an almost unhealthy amount of pictures of my great dane... I'll be frank, I'm still unsure as to why she did that.

*FLUSH*

Grandma took a very serious, hushed tone of voice, as if she were holed up in some attic somewhere and that my grandfather would be listening. ""Can I please, just, steal one cigarette?"" And who am I to deny my grandmother? I hurried and handed her a smoke and a piece of gum which she quickly palmed as Grandpa came out of the bathroom. We said our goodbyes and hoped to see eachother soon and they tore off into the sunset.

My grandparents are a huge part of my life, and this was the first time I got to see them in a long time and of course they had to give it it's own unique little turn of events. What was the point of this post? Who knows. Blame it on the three joints I just smoked.

I was throwing up for days apparently before I was picked up by an ambulance after being found unresponsive, but I have no memory past May 5th.  Apparently, the doctors read no brain activity for the first day, assumed I was brain dead, but the next day it came back, but my kidneys began to fail. Just before they were going to put me on dialysis, they began working again. The doctor working my case visited my room and told me how lucky I was to have survived. I coded for 2 hours and was manually breathed with a bag system for those two hours. My heart was at 20 percent function when they found me. Had I been found unconscious any later I would have died before I had a chance. They didn&amp;#39;t think I would even really come back mentally because I was out for so long, but here I am writing this whole thing out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things are looking up now though, I&amp;#39;ve started outpatient rehab and I&amp;#39;ve been clean from coke and oxy since I went into the hospital. I always heard coke could give you a heart attack, but never really believed it would happen to me, especially at only 20 years old. Goes to show ya it can happen to anyone. Be safe out there guys, and thanks for listening.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'cocaine', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2qu9w', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/cocaine', 'subreddit_subscribers': 70379, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'My Favorite Drug Almost Killed Me', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 19, 'upvote_ratio': 0.86, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/cocaine/comments/hal0im/my_favorite_drug_almost_killed_me/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': 'no_ads', 'wls': 0}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anyways is it worth the risk? 
I'm not sure if covid messed up the schedule or not I did smoke during lockdown which was real good, and to add I'm a casual worker but sometimes I need to operate certain vehicles.
Do causal workers get tested regularly or are we kinda brushed off to the side?

I know that things like tums help to potentiate amphetamines, but I'm looking for something different that isn't super unhealthy. taking tums everyday will just fuck up my gut. also are there any sort of supplements that help to reduce tolerance at all?

I’ve only done molly twice but I’ve done acid about 8 times so I’m pretty strong minded and comfortable with being in public. 

Anyways I went to the bathroom and pulled out the crushed molly powder. I probably took about 2 wet full fingers before throwing up instantly into the toilet. My gf on the other hand ate about 4 full fingers and despite some gagging due to the taste she felt fine and never threw up. After about 2 hours I wasn’t expecting to feel anything because I threw it all up but I started noticing something was “OFF” I didn’t feel high at all but I didn’t feel sober either ? Infact the most obvious sign that I was high on something was my lips. For the entire day my lips were slightly numb but I could still feel them, . My gf claimed she felt amazing within the first half of the day and then halfway towards the end she stated feeling sick also
 We both got sweaty extremely fast and tried to drink a lot of water but anything we ate or drank felt very heavy so we had to drink water in very small amounts. We even tried to eat some fruits but our stomachs would be in pain. About 9 hours later we get back to the hotel and we both agree that it came down a lot but we were still feeling it.

So I (17m) had purchased some salvia online after realizing it’s still legal in my state and was excited to try it as I had read so many interesting stories online before. I’ve done LSD over a dozen times along with some other psychedelics so I was pretty confident I would be able to handle myself, but the first time I try something new I feel a lot more safe and comfortable if I’m with my friends so I know shit can’t hit the fan too hard. I had had the salvia for about a week at this point so after my friend, we’ll call him Gene, invited me over, I decided I would bring it. Cut to Gene, his sister, his sister’s boyfriend, and I all sitting at a gazebo isolated on a hill above their house. They had gone up to smoke some weed and agreed to supervise me while I hit the salvia. We’re all talking and I’m super nervous because I have no idea how fucked up I’m about to be but I eventually get myself to hit the salvia super hard.

I held it in for around 45 seconds and exhaled and was immediately incredibly underwhelmed as I felt very minor effects. While I definitely noticed I was hallucinating as all the leaves and plants around us slowly began to form patterns with each other and look super similar, I felt only mild weed high. Disappointed, I decided to try again as maybe I just did it wrong. In retrospect, I think I was just not heating the salvia up enough as my lighter was shit and I wasn’t holding it long enough, but I’m still not quite sure. I pack another bowl and take another big hit and again not much happens, but I began to feel really confused. My friends around me were suggesting that I just give it up but at this point, but I was really pissed off so I packed an even bigger bowl and after doing some quick research online made sure that I held the lighter over the salvia for a sufficiently long time. I remember holding my breath trying to relax as I counted upwards towards 45 but then I just completely phased out of consciousness, almost as if I completely fell asleep while still being entirely awake.

All of a sudden I’m again sitting where I was and realize that I wasn’t holding my breath anymore. I’m super confused at what just happened and I begin to look around me and while I’m sitting exactly where I was, everything looks super alien and I feel like I am in an entirely different place. At this point, I begin to convince myself that I’m currently in a salvia breakthrough and am hallucinating everything around me. In my head, this makes perfect sense. Everything is super slowed down and I begin to look at my friends around me. The sister and the boyfriend are sitting across from each other still smoking and Gene is sitting across from me. Knowing that I’m not back on Earth anymore, I begin to realize that these people around me are not actually the friends I’ve known for so many years, rather some foreign entities that have accompanied me to this alien world. All this time, I’m just slowly looking around, super confused, saying, “what? .... No… wait… what?” super slowly. The sister and boyfriend aren’t really paying attention and Gene slowly reaches into his pocket and pulls out a singular small sock with a picture of a ghost on it and hands it to me. I had no idea he had brought this sock up with him or what reason he possibly had to give it to me, so this is really only further confirming that he’s not Gene. As he begins to slowly talk to me I look down at the sock in my hands and my brain is just so fucked at this point. I feel a super strong force start to push at my chin, forcing me further into the bench. I start to rotate the sock in my hands and as I do so, I feel the force on my chin rotate along with it. It was super weird, I would move the sock, feel the force move, move the sock back to where it was before, and feel the force move back. I look up at the figure before me and wonder what the significance of this object is and why this divine being has given it to me. I begin to converse with it, again, thinking that I’m talking to some God or being, while my friend has absolutely no idea I don’t think he is real. As he’s talking to me I have no idea what he’s saying yet understand all his words perfectly, still just fucking with the sock the whole time. In my head the whole time I’m thinking, “Ok so I’m 90% sure that I am hallucinating everything around me but I might just be super high so I can’t explain myself to this entity just in case it’s actually my friend so he doesn’t think I’m stupid.” At this point, I begin to say, “Ok… I get it… I know… wait, what?” As I’m trying to explain my knowledge of the entity and the world I am in while also not giving myself away while also still being super fucking confused.

Then I hear what sounds like a loud cough or some other noise coming from the steps below leading up to the gazebo which are out of sight. Scared because we have so much drug shit out and that there might be a random person coming up, I look at the entity in terror, asking what we should do and if there is a person coming. My friend begins to try to calm me down, explaining that there was no noise, no one is coming, and that I just need to relax. This only freaks me out more, however, as I am now fully convinced that these entities are trying to keep me captive at this alien gazebo while something sinister is being set up, so I know I have to leave NOW before something happens. I stand up and try to start packing my stuff away into my backpack while explaining to the entities that I know what is going on and that I am leaving in super short sentence fragments, just like before. Gene continues to try to get me to sit down and the boyfriend intervenes and stands beside me, trying to put my shit back down to me back on the bench. While he’s being gentle and calm, he’s still physically touching me which only worries me more at how this situation will soon escalate. I start to pretend to calm down and comply so he moves away, only to say, “sike” and quickly put everything away and put my backpack on. As this is happening, suddenly the salvia begins to wear off super quickly and I begin to become sober again. Now getting up to leave, I begin to think and look at my friends around me and reality starts to set in that I’ve just been here at the gazebo just talking to my friends the whole time. At this point, I feel like such an idiot and we all begin to pack up to go back inside. I ask Gene why he gave me the sock and he said he just wanted to fuck with me lol. Such a fucking weird and funny experience and I haven’t really been interested in trying salvia again since.

Q1. What are healthier options to use cocaine rather than snorting it or gumming it?

Q2. Someone told me that they add their coke to their nasal spray and thats how they use it, is that possible and if so what ratio should I use?

Q3. Is coke edible? I know you can gum it but I'd love to be able to drink it instead and if it is, would it be the same high as snorting it and would it damage my throat in anyway?

Q4. How long does cocaine tolerance take to break? The first time I did coke I was high for almost 2 hrs from 3 lines, I didnt do coke for around until my friend re introduced me like 2 weeks ago I was only high for around an hour this time but I did smaller lines and the coke wasnt as good. (According to my friend.)

Q5. How long does it take to develop nostril/gum problems from cocaine use? I currently only do 2 skinny lines the size of a matchstick in the morning and another line after work. I plan on taking breaks to lower my tolerance to keep the same use or around the same.

Q6. How quickly does tolerance take to build up? and how often would you guys recommend breaks?

went out with a bunch of friends to light a joint and after meeting we went to a suburban area which isnt patroled a lot by police, sparked the joint and while smoking some cops pulled up to check on us, as soon as i saw the car i dropped my 2 grams of cocaine and the joint 20 meters away from all of us and acted like nothing happened (the police didnt see us throwing it away), explained why we were there and after we talked for a long time with usthey found the bag with the drugs in it
(after not admitting that is mine they arrested me and i was sent to the police station for an interview)

Arrived at the policed station with my other 3 friends and they start asking me and saying if i admit it, there will not be any consequences since i was 17 at the time (about to turn 18 in two hours) i told them that i would love to admit it but i only tell the truth and said that the drugs aren't mine nor my friends'.
They finished asking us in a group so we got separate rooms for questioning now and everyone of us goes in the room, i was with the head officer, the 3 friends were with normal officers, luckily the head officer that interviewed me got the drugs along with him at the room i was being questioned, he seemed a little bit drunk and i started cracking some jokes with him and we were both laughing while i was being interviewed for about 30 minutes.

Suddenly he gets a phone call, seemed like it was the prosecutors, he got out quickly and left the door open and thats when i heard him gettin far away from the room i was in, i look in the table and see my 2 bags of cokr in there and his wallet with his car keys at the side, looked around for cameras and didnt see any got up quickly and snorted from the bag some cocaine, the other bag was full so i put it in a secret pocket in my shoes, replaced the bag that i put in my shoes with some sugar bag, opened his wallet and found 100 euros which i took and put it in the same pocket in my shoes and went back to my chair, the police officer came in and didnt notice anything, gave me my id and documents and told me since they didnt find it on me or my car i was free to go.

Got out of the room to see my friends also freed and made it out with no case, got in the car and told them what i did, they wents nuts and didnt believe it until i showed them. Exactly 43 mintues ago i turned 18 and now im partying with my friends in my house with the cocaine i got back from the police station and SURELY, this was the best gift i did to myself for my 18th birthday.

Until recently I was oblivious to the risks of opiates and benzos (naivety on my part). My GP never really mentioned interactions, just said not to take more than 1mg at a time, or 2mg a day. The codeine I have cut down on - used to take 300mg a day - now take 90mg in the morning as I tend to wake with a rebound headache (please no judgement). Then at night I'll take 2mg lorazepam along with my other nightly meds (amityptaline, Propanolol and Zopiclone). 

So yeah, without me knowing the dangers of mixing the two I had been taking 2mg (or even 3mg sometimes) loraz with codeine at the same time. No gaps between doses. I think my current plan works of taking opiates in morning for pain and benzos in evening. Given that there's the hours between doses. However, tonight I have had a super bad migraine and had already taken my 2mg lorazepam so have taken 60mg codeine and 2 cocodomal 8/500 so 76mg.. I'm literally in agony and just want to sleep not DIE. Will I be okay?

A few days ago I bought two tabs from my plug and took LSD for the first time alone at home. I took 2/3rds of a tab (my plug claimed each tab was 300ug so I thought I was taking 200ug). The trip was really fun and introspective, but after doing a bunch of research I can tell that I took a lot less than what I thought I was taking. 

I didn’t see any fractals or anything like that and was able to have basic function for the majority of it. I had to focus really hard to see any closed eye visuals, and besides distortions and increased color saturation I only saw minor hallucinations with the tingly body high feeling and euphoria/creativity (based on my research I’m assuming the 2/3rds of a tab I took was about 75-100ug?). Although I was a bit scared at first, I was mentally at peace for the majority of the experience and I feel I am definitely ready for a significantly higher dose.

I still have a tab and a 1/3rd left from the same batch, and I’m wondering how many ug that would be estimated to be based on my experiences taking 2/3rds of a tab. Next time I trip I want to feel the full experience in full effect because the experience I had was kinda underwhelming, so I want to make sure my remaining tab and a 1/3rd is enough to accomplish that. Like I want to see all the fractals and crazy closed eye hallucinations and have ego loss.

Please give me any advice, because if what I have left is not enough I can just buy another tab off my plug to make sure next time I get the full experience (and I also plan to be with a friend to trip sit).

I’ve been recently conducting a few experiments regarding enlightement levels relative to each drug and the results were quite suprising to say the least...

So the first month i administered 50 micrograms of 99% purity lsd (analingually) on the first day and doubled the dose each day accordingly to account for tolerance.

Lsd sounded promising because I am a great philosopherist and i needed to think quite harder to be better than the noncomplex simpeltons i encounter in my daily life, but alas after about 3 weeks in the experiment i had my 700th epiphany while my asshole was raw from all the acid it was taking these days, i realized that the feeling of clarity was just a delusion, a mere jest by god (or tom cruise), so i went and searched further to find answers.

After realizing the acid retards on reddit were wrong, i knew that i just had to do the opposite drug of lsd and i perhaps finally catch up to the secrets of life itself. Thats when i popped 4 (four) miligrams of pharmasuitical alpralozmar and started writing down my thoughts in a journal, i did this everyday for all of May. 
I also did increase my dose to counter tolerance and have the same philosophistical potential each day, so i added 2mg for every day, so on the last day i ended up taking 34 miligrams of xanax, thats when i thought it was a complete waste of a month, cause i didnt even have the journal i cant remember where it was.

But the next day it hit me, it was so simple.

Benzos are easily the most mentally and spiritially beneficial drugs, psychedelic users are just looking for a quick high and some “cool visuals”

How do i know?

Next day after the month of lsd i felt fine as if nothing had changed, except some severe hppd but im a real one, so its nothing.

But the next day after xanax experiment, i suddenly felt it - i started shaking and vomiting, i had never been so scared in my life and i didnt know what to do, but i quickly realized i was making the spirits mad because i stopped communicating with them, so i popped a double dose (70 mg) and within a few minutes i felt that the indian and nordic gods (totem and thor) were once again happy with me.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,687752,public,confidence,self,Xanax more mentally healthy than lsd?,0,[],0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hcu3ub/xanax_more_mentally_healthy_than_lsd/,no_ads,0.0,1592717178.0,GABAergics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But then the next day I noticed something truly incredible, my usual frown and misery was gone! Instead I was super hyper and smiling like I was a kid again. I actually found myself smiling uncontrollably and just happy to be alive when normally im wallowing in self pity and just want it to end.

The next day rolled around and I aced a job interview at a warehouse so im finally employed after 6 months of claiming benefits, I was chatty and didnt get caught on my words in the interview like I normally would.

I also released for peaceful tripping: Lofi Trip
And also released for shrooms trip: Mushroom Shaman

My story here:
I have a family, and a business, I used to create just general dance music as a hobby(under different name) and never took ANY substance. After an LSD trip at night where I literally thought I was in a mad max style life, living on Mars, in a floating hotel, where I did radio transmissions to the people of Mars and Earth to wake up from the fruitless cat and mouse game of Life. It was surreal because our bedroom house seemed like it floated and then life went back to normal after I woke up. 

But nothing was normal. Lol. I basically stopped making heavy EDM music and started creating music that I could trip to. I started testing music and tripping. Started with lofi and heavy EDM, but certain sounds just made the trip go into a dark place. Eventually I combined lofi, light dubstep and summer house genes to release this album.

I have been self treating anxiety and depression with amitriptyline (50mg) for 3.5 years. While it helped, the side effects are too much. Anticholinergic, massive weight gain, brain fog, social awkwardness. 

I miss the person I was before. I am ready to stop. I have been through trazodone withdrawals (3 months of usage), and I have been mentally scarred by them. I don’t have the mental capacity to go through them again. I am in my mid twenties, and I want to continue my life medication free.


I was reading up that serotonin receptors take a long time to heal. Also I will be facing cholinergic rebound, noradrenaline low levels, and also amitriptyline is an antihistamine as well.


What would you advise me to so? 

None of the serotonin precursors worked for me during trazodone withdrawal. I was hospitalized 5 times. Even benzos worked for a few hours. I couldn’t sleep or interact with people without having a panic attack.

After like 45 min i started feeling the affects first i just felt high like light in my head and my vision became so sharp it was insane and the colors were so vivid and nice. I did felt kinda bad for my friend because i was legit spacing out and i was in my own little world while she had to sit through it with me and the thing is i didn’t have anything to say because i couldn’t think properly and i couldn’t even talk so i knew she was kinda bored. 1 hour and a half in and this is where i peaked. I looked at my phone because i was trying to find some music to play and the little app icons legit started moving. Then i was on youtube and the faces on some video’s thumbnails were also shifting and kind of breathing which was so cool i could watch it for hours. The music sounded soooo good and it was also spacing me out even more i was legit unaware of my head moving to the music and i only knew cause my friend told me i was. After that we looked at some memes on reddit and the most unfunny things made me cry of laughter. After like 4 hours i noticed it coming back down and i wasn’t as spacey anymore and could actually think of what im about to say but the colors where still vivid and things were kinda moving still but not as much. Now as i am writing this it has completely faded away because its now 6+ hours ago since i took them but i do have to say that i feel tired and didn’t know truffles were that strong.

Even a little bit? If so I would really like to hear from you in the comments. Because I am full of insecurity about myself and my future.

Quick overview: A certain (opioid) drug seems to magically solve a nearly impossible problem for me. What does this say about me?

First off, I don’t do any recreational drugs or even drink alcohol. But I have 1 bottle of leftover Norcos from wisdom teeth (they’re Tylenol mixed with Vicodin).

Sometimes, when I am feeling utterly miserable, and every thought is negative, and every interaction with anybody makes me feel unbearably horrible, and I feel like I want to explode from the mental suffering I am experiencing (this is not an exaggeration at all) I have found that if I take just 1 of these pills, then in less than an hour I feel NORMAL. I am myself again. Like magic.

The average frequency is approximately one pill every 4-6 weeks. (But the timing can vary a lot.) The surgery was 2 years ago, and I have 9 pills left in the bottle today.

Without these pills, I would typically just suffer through (and deal with the life consequences of being withdrawn like a werewolf locked away). I have known since early teen years that occasionally I have some really rough nights where my world falls apart completely.

I have seen nearly a dozen therapists over the years, and honestly, nothing I’ve ever experienced works so dramatically as these pills. They just make my mental pain vanish.

I don’t want a psychiatric prescription because I don’t want to be medicated all the time.
These pills seem like a good solution. 
Am I stupid?

Also, at this rate my 9 remaining pills will run out around New Years I think. I don’t know if it’s wise to ask for more from a doctor.

To be honest, I’m scared of the road ahead because if I had access to more pills, and someone told me it was safe to take them, I would probably take one every 2-3 weeks (about 2x as often). It already requires discipline for me to try every other solution first.

I feel broken because my brain torments me so cruelly sometimes, and I don’t understand what’s wrong with me. But the effect of taking a single pill as a last resort is unmistakable. I go from contemplating trashing all my relationships and opportunities for no reason, to just feeling fine and back to normal. WTF?

What does it mean? What should I do? I am so out of my depth. I don’t have any friends who do drugs or anyone to talk to about this. 

For example, I am very scared to think about popping a pill before going to socialize with friends just to guarantee I have a great night. (I haven’t tried it, but I know some people do that.) If I had access to more pills, I bet I would have already tried it. And that thought really frightens me. Because it would be socially unacceptable, I would have to hide it, and that just seems like a really bad road to go down... do you agree?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,687723,public,confidence,self,Who can relate?

((Note: you can skip down a couple paragraphs to the one starting with 'So we arrive at meth' if you just want to read my problem/question))

My job is pretty menial where I'm usually just packing stuff in boxes, wrapping shit with shipping wrap, counting out four different kinds of screws then putting them all in a big bag with assembly instructions...Nothing operating power tools or heavy machinery, or tremendous attention to detail.

Anyway like I said, trying out various drugs. At first Kratom seemed like the clear winner: cheap, legal, mild buzz that's almost like Tramadol minus the seizures. Inevitably though, like the other job I started out using Kratom at, after two weeks and some change I noticed Kratom really wasn't doing anything for me anymore. When I reach this weird ceiling effect even doubling the dose really doesn't bring the high back, I've even gotten dysphoric once or twice from taking more.

So Kratom seems doomed to only be effective occasionally. Maybe because it's a partial agonist, who knows. So anyway next in line was fentanyl. This was never a serious long-term choice, I've been addicted to opioids in the past and it's not worth the expenditure or constant trips to the bathroom constantly staving off fentanyl's two hour half-life.
Again, an occasional option, buy half a gram when I know work is going to be particularly grueling and float through two or three days unscathed.

So we arrive at meth. My dealer threw me a single fat shard for free while he was dropping me off some fentanyl. I've done meth before in the past, and it's fun, but if I do even a little bit too much I'm stuck with this crazy compulsive urge to crack my joints. Knuckles, ankles, shoulders, neck, wrists, it's annoying enough alone or with other users but at work or in public it really makes you look like a crackhead.

So before work I crushed up the single shard, and still only did maybe half of that. A small line. It felt about right too because at work I had tons of energy, time went by at a decent rate, but I didn't feel ""high"" or overly talkative. 

That stupid, constant urge to crack my joints came roaring back about half-way through my six hour shift though, and it's one of those things that even trying hard just to not do it or ignore it was a losing battle. I think it might be the meth wearing off that makes me more jittery, as in the past too I remember it's more towards the end of the high it would happen.

Anyway the whole point of this post though is to ask if anybody has an OTC medication or supplement that might help with this, or even a prescription medication (if it's not controlled I can probably get it prescribed). For reference I am currently taking 40mg of Prozac once a day, 15mg of Remeron at night for sleep, and Visteril &amp; Xanaflex as needed.

Thanks for any advice, just please lay off with ""Just don't do meth"" ""Meth is bad"" ""Meth will ruin your life"". I have plenty of experience with meth, at one point five years ago I was doing it several times a day, every day for a year solid. One day I decided I was tired of being a homeless methhead and stopped doing it. I remember sleeping for about three days, being grumpy, but otherwise never got cravings or withdrawals. 

My point with that last excerpt is that I have put meth down and walked away from it many times, I'm not worried about addiction. As to my problem currently, I'm going to try lowering my daily dose before work, to see if I feel roughly the same amount of 
energy/lack of boredom minus some of the jitteriness/twitchiness.

Sorry for this long, rambling post, I am obviously still buzzed from the small line I railed ten hours ago.

I don’t really smoke weed a whole lot, so my tolerance is rather small. This girl who I’ve been work friends with for the past year (her and I have gone out once before) had asked me yesterday if I wanted to get together and smoke after work. 

We ended up getting together at around 4:30pm. And we smoked. I smoked one small bowl and she smoked two decent sized ones. She is a fairly regular stoner, so I don’t know what 2 bowls for her is to one small bowl for me. 

We went bowling afterwards. During the drive to the bowling alley, I was pretty quiet. I would talk when she talked to me and I maybe said a couple things outside of that, but I was mostly in my head as we were listening to music, and thinking about whatever. I pointed out that I tend to be rather quiet when high, and she said that it was cool just listening to music and vibing. I was high so I overthought that statement and whether it was true or not.

Bowling went a lot better. Having the activity to talk about made me a lot more comfortable, and we both had a good time (I think).

Once we were finished bowling, we were on out way out and she told me her mom messaged her to come home to help find her dad a Father’s Day gift. Being totally honest,I was pretty paranoid about this, I kinda felt like this was just an excuse to end the date.

We got back to my place (she was driving because she just got a new car, and cause I’m not gonna try driving stoned) and I sat thinking for a moment how I could make a move. And feeling overwhelmed by the magnitude of such a decision as kissing her before I go, I hugged her and got out of the car said bye and that was it.

I’ve been over thinking this hard mostly cause I’m still stoned right now. I feel like it didn’t go bad, but I’m way overthinking some things and I can’t help but feel like I may have messed up my chances for another date with this girl.

I think partly I’m not 100% comfortable with her still, and I’m definitely kind of an introverted anyways so smoking weed may have made me more introverted because of a lack of sense of trust between her and I.

So I've been smoking weed for the last 4-5 years, I wouldn't say I'm bored of but it it's more of a habitual thing I do at this point an doesn't make migh anymore it just brings me back to normal. I have done LSD a few times and psychedelics are fun but something I keep to at least once a year or so, valium was something I really used to enjoy but have lost love for since I now realise it was the shitty (most likely fentanyl) ones I was into. 

Anyways I'm looking for a new drugs to try, I really like relaxing drugs that can give me a really chill euphoric buzz and easy to pass out on, I've looked into morphine sulfate and a couple others but I'd also love to get my hands on something like adderall (or ritalin I've heard, again please comment with your own experiences) as it's the only stimulant I know I would like to try, unfortunately I can't without paying loads for it as I'm not from the US and that shits expensive. I don't like coke that much and e's aren't my thing either. I can order from anywhere but the extensive lists of things he makes me want more about each before I go buying.

Basically I want you to tell me from your own experiences what kinda things along those lines you would recommend. Morphine sulfate looks like a contender but I need to know a lot more about over dosing and safety before I ever try it. I want your opinions too since google has been a nightmare to find any sort of information regarding this. So any help is greatly appreciated.

I was taking it at night to sleep and would enjoy getting high, even tho I didn’t know about drugs or getting high. Obviously I built a tolerance and had to start stealing a few to still get “dreamy”, that’s what i called it. 

I remember trying to describe it to a school friend and they thought I was crazy and the teacher phoned my parents after over hearing “I take these pills and I feel really tired and happy” or something like that. My parents denied all of this of course but after that I never got more of these pills. Yet they never discussed it with me which I find odd. They just gave me a few to help to help with nth else very mild wd I got.

The thing is it’s prescription only so I’m confused on how I got this because after looking it up it’s not for children under 18, so did a doctor wrongly prescribe it to me ? Or was it prescribed to my parents and then they wrongly gave it to me ? Or am I to blame for trying to get high at 7 and abusing a normal pill given to children ? Because it just doesn’t feel right what happend, looking back on it.

I suspect I always had trouble sleeping and my parents got me some of my dads pills to help me sleep and then after the school phoned they realised what they’d been doing had been wrong and they stopped.

While it sounds like a small thing I believe I did worse at school because of it because of “brain fog” and I became a little zoned out. I also started using drugs very young after this, could my subconscious of been trying to recreate the ambien feeling I used to have without me realising it, I’ve tried virtually all mainstream drugs now. I also believe it made me depressed at the time

I am aware of the potential dangers that can be caused by risky combinations this. It's just purely my personal experience of the times I've done it, which is somewhere around 15 times now.

So I've been taking ambien for about 2 years now since I first started after having a very difficult insomnia episode. This medication was life changing for me and made me get through my depression. I have to admit I don't really need it anymore but it makes my sleep just so incredibly good that I don't want to stop. I've tried out literally everything that helps with sleep over the past year or so (many drugs/every method, workouts/meditation/ even going as far as changing the scent of my room) but nothing seems to come close to the quality of sleep I get on ambien except maybe benzo's but those have too many negative side effects so I only took it a few times and never again.

I take half an ambien almost every night which is enough to make me fall asleep in just minutes. I've read about the side effects but I've never experienced any of it the day afterwards. Maybe it's because I don't take much, I would never take more than what I need anyway.

So let's talk about alcohol in the mix. One day I came home from a night of drinking (I think this was in February) and I took my dose without really knowing what I was getting into. I didn't go to sleep immediately like I should of. So basically what happened is this created an entirely new effect on me that I haven't really experienced before on just ambien.
(When I drink a socially acceptable amount of alcohol I become slow, less aware, tired and overall just lazy and boring. When I take half a zolpidem (ambien brand) I start hearing and seeing shit in my room, but only when the lights are turned off. I never did anything weird on ambiem alone.)

But weirdly enough neither of this happens when I take these 2 combined. Instead what happens is I become extremely energized, I can't sit still and just want to dance to music. I also become very social and start talking to all my friends online, usually I tell them secrets I didn't want to share, with no reclamation of what I said the day afterwards. I even message people I haven't talked to in years. I do seem to be typing in an understanding way however. I also become creative, I once wrote an entire poem which I never did willingly in  my life. It wasn't really bad but just extremely random. Also I made a few songs in garageband. My friends even made a discord channel where they post all of the weird shit I say when I drink and use ambien. They think it's just drunk me but I haven't  told them about the ambien, I don't think this is a good idea.

I also gotta note that I've never taken this during the day or left my house doing this, all of it was online. I've also never drank more than 3 beers while on half an ambien (each of them are about 4,5%). I don't  think I want to push my limits, there's no reaso to go further than this. 

Honestly this whole thing makes me feel like a drug addict. I don't normally take drugs to trip, only things that help me with problems like sleep and anxiety. But this is an experience on a whole other level really. I took MDMA once and it's actually very similar to that for me, but without the comedown. Nothing really compares to this I gotta say. It's like I'm living a dream. It doesn't even seem to get old either.

Should I seek help? Honestly I'm worried that one day someone finds out about it because something bad happened to me. I'm not really addicted to ambien because there have been many weeks where I didn't take anything, just stopped cold turkey but I just started again because it made me so much more awake during the day and since I don't experience any negative symptoms so far, is there any reason to stop?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,687635,public,confidence,self,My experiences mixing ambien and alcohol,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hcnxpq/my_experiences_mixing_ambien_and_alcohol/,no_ads,0.0,1592695036.0,GABAergics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Does that stop anyone? No. The amount of people I know that started taking mdma, coke, ket, nos, and other things at 15/16 is very high. They still did them despite being told not to. What a surprise, that’s what teenagers do. However they did not know anything about how to use safely. My friend took her first mdma pill when she was 14 and ended up taking them every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. She’s 17 now and her hands shake constantly, her jaw moves constantly whilst she’s asleep, and she has some problems with feeling down frequently. She got off so lightly compared to what could have happened. She took that first mdma pill without having any idea what it would do to her, she thought it was like getting drunk. She only learned about the 3 month rule when she was 16. 



I was watching a BBC News vídeo about a 14 year old boy who died after overdosing on his first time doing mdma. The dealer sold him 2 pills advertised as 400mg. He took them both at once. His tragic death could have been avoided if he knew at least something about dosage, and of course if a shitty dealer didn’t sell a 14 year old drugs. 


A group of boys who went to my school started taking cocaine at 15. They did not know how addictive it is and they didn’t know about the risks. They all ended up addicted to coke at 15 years old. Luckily none of them died and they have stopped using it now but they all still have issues with mental health and not having any GCSE’s. 


My best friend started taking ket by dissolving it in water and drinking the water, not knowing it would crystallise again in her kidneys. She wanted to sniff it whilst she was drunk, not knowing that it could potentially kill her. She ended up in hospital with issues with her appendix and kidneys. 


So many people I know do nos (nitrous oxide, balloons, etc.). They are 17/18 and had absolutely no idea that it could paralyse them or kill them with ease. They literally didn’t understand that decreased oxygen to the brain can cause issues like strokes. They don’t know how it works, they just see their dealers advertising it on Snapchat and buy it to try. 


I’m sure everyone around my age (18) has stories of teenagers they know doing drugs without knowing anything about them. I’m so lucky that I know to properly find out everything possible about a drug before taking it and that I’m aware of things that keep me safe whilst doing drugs. It’s scary knowing that your friends or someone you know could overdose or have something bad happen to them at any point because they don’t know the risks or how to be safe whilst high. 


This is why we need proper drug education. Not directly taught but maybe make a drug database that is accessible to everyone that lists all the risks and things like safe dosage, what to do to maje sure you’re okay whilst you’re high.

I was taking it at night to sleep and would enjoy getting high, even tho I didn’t know about drugs or getting high. Obviously I built a tolerance and had to start stealing a few to still get “dreamy”, that’s what i called it. 

I remember trying to describe it to a school friend and they thought I was crazy and the teacher phoned my parents after over hearing “I take these pills and I feel really tired and happy” or something like that. My parents denied all of this of course but after that I never got more of these pills. Yet they never discussed it with me which I find odd. They just gave me a few to help to help with nth else very mild wd I got.

The thing is it’s prescription only so I’m confused on how I got this because after looking it up it’s not for children under 18, so did a doctor wrongly prescribe it to me ? Or was it prescribed to my parents and then they wrongly gave it to me ? Or am I to blame for trying to get high at 7 and abusing a normal pill given to children ? Because it just doesn’t feel right what happend, looking back on it.

I suspect I always had trouble sleeping and my parents got me some of my dads pills to help me sleep and then after the school phoned they realised what they’d been doing had been wrong and they stopped.

While it sounds like a small thing I believe I did worse at school because of it because of “brain fog” and I became a little zoned out. I also started using drugs very young after this, could my subconscious of been trying to recreate the ambien feeling I used to have without me realising it, I’ve tried virtually all mainstream drugs now. I also believe it made me depressed at the time

The thing is that after working the night shift and smoking hash through the bottle( we mostly do it here) my health went down with some serious stomach - throat issues( always have the filling of spit or phlegm in the upper throat) Turned out I had helycobacteria in my stomach which was cured by antibiotics, but it went on. I went to otolaryngologist to get the throat checked and it was tonsillitis. The doctor prescribed gurgling with mineral water and some other stuff, which didn’t help much, but said I had a reflux.

I was taking it at night to sleep and would enjoy getting high, even tho I didn’t know about drugs or getting high. Obviously I built a tolerance and had to start stealing a few to still get “dreamy”, that’s what i called it. 

I remember trying to describe it to a school friend and they thought I was crazy and the teacher phoned my parents after over hearing “I take these pills and I feel really tired and happy” or something like that. My parents denied all of this of course but after that I never got more of these pills. Yet they never discussed it with me which I find odd. They just gave me a few to help to help with nth else very mild wd I got.

The thing is it’s prescription only so I’m confused on how I got this because after looking it up it’s not for children under 18, so did a doctor wrongly prescribe it to me ? Or was it prescribed to my parents and then they wrongly gave it to me ? Or am I to blame for trying to get high at 7 and abusing a normal pill given to children ? Because it just doesn’t feel right what happend, looking back on it.

I suspect I always had trouble sleeping and my parents got me some of my dads pills to help me sleep and then after the school phoned they realised what they’d been doing had been wrong and they stopped.

While it sounds like a small thing I believe I did worse at school because of it because of “brain fog” and I became a little zoned out. I also started using drugs very young after this, could my subconscious of been trying to recreate the ambien feeling I used to have without me realising it, I’ve tried virtually all mainstream drugs now. I also believe it made me depressed at the time

So I have never done this on my own before. My balloon will only fill up a little bit and then air starts immediately escaping. At first I thought it was from the tip of the cracker, hence why you see the rubber band and shoestring tightened around the tip (I've been pinching the balloon when it's only filled enough to just start to stretch out and just hitting it after taking apart the cracker and putting my mouth over the cracker itself and releasing my hand from pinching the balloon. This is giving me mild freeze burns). What I've noticed is that the gas seems to be escaping from the middle of the cracker. Is this just a bad cracker? I tried just barely twisting it open just enough to get the gas to start coming out and it still seems like the gas escapes from the middle where the 2 halfs connect. I'm not sure how to better describe it, or if this might be a common problem that someone here knows an easy fix to.

I had never had a bad experience with weed and it was always a good time. In february I went to a rave with some friends and popped some molly and spent the next few days coming down. On I think the 4th day of the comedown, I took a rip from a bong after 3 months w/o weed and all hell broke loose. I started dissociating from reality, thinking about really morbid shit, thinking I was having a heart attack, and just panicking. Eventually my housemate was able to calm me down by just keeping me talking and I fell asleep and the next day I felt back to normal although I don't think I ever fully recovered from that. I had NEVER experienced anything like that from weed. It was like a bad psychedelic trip but my friends just kept saying ""you were just really high"" and ""no way weed did that to you"". To this day I still think the molly comedown played a role in that nightmare.

My mind basically went back to normal after that until I had an absolute monstrosity of a shrooms trip in May of this year. it was my third time doing shrooms. The first was a great experience. The 2nd was okay. i suspect that the shrooms were either moldy, i took too much, or both. I began experiencing more of the same thing as I did that time I took a bong rip after a 3 month hiatus: dissociating from reality, feeling complete and utter terror, thinking about how meaningless our very existence was, feeling like I was dying, etc. I was with my friends and apparently I did a lot of weird shit including saying I thought i needed to go to the hospital. The thing is, i dont remember any of it. I woke up in my bed like 7 hours later and it felt as though I had woken up from a coma. It took like an hour for me to realize what had happened.

In the weeks following, I smoked some weed and for the most part things were ok but very rarely I would get mini flashbacks to that shrooms trip. Then about 2 weeks ago, I smoked and then had a really intense flashback, started shivering uncontrollably, and decided to quit indefinitely. 

Unlike the previous experiences, my mind did not recover from this one. i have since continued to have episodes filled with extreme anxiety and paranoia where I feel like I am detached from reality and all I can think about is how meaningless our existence is and that death is going to come for us and everyone we love and that just instills a sense of dread in me like nothing I've ever experienced. It's like I went into the Matrix, took the biggest red pill possible and got spit out and expected to act like it didn't happen. The episodes happen at least 3 times a day but especially when I am not really doing anything (like driving down the highway), or after I eat. i think maybe the process of digestion releases some leftover chemicals that in turn puts my brain into this state but idk. Sometimes I will feel fine like i've recovered only to be totally not fine in a few hours. 

I thought maybe I'm having these episodes because of the CONSTANT doomsday headlines of this year (COVID pandemic, recent violence coming from protests, genocide in Yemen, etc), or that maybe I wasn't getting enough sleep, I was missing my family, I had nothing to occupy my time, or that maybe I was experiencing psychosis from the first two experiences I mentioned. I honestly have no clue since I have tried getting at least 9 hours of sleep every night, I have come back home to spend some time with my family, and I have been helping around the house to occupy my time. None of it seems to work and now I'm thinking about making an appointment with student health, maybe joining some recovery program, and getting some anti-psychotic medication to control the anxiety. 

Anyway, that's what's been going on every day. I have moments where I enjoy myself and still socialize normally, but these intrusive thoughts of existential dread always find a way to infect my mind. I honestly didn't know which sub to post under but honestly I still think the drugs had something to do with it. it could be the weed during the molly comedown, the really bad shrooms, or maybe just the negativity on the news. I just know that if I'm thinking about morbid shit like death everyday at age 21, something is seriously fucked up. Anyway I appreciate all the help I can get, but PLEASE DO NOT tell me again that it ""couldn't have been weed"" like weed is an innocent plant that can never do wrong. I'm sick and tired of hearing it.

The first few hours weren't all that special. I did my usual routine: walked my dog, watched ""Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas"", and ate some food.

When the peak was starting to set in I decided to go for a short walk around the neighborhood, which ended up being a two hour walk around many surrounding neighborhoods and a hike up a mountain.

I don't know why, but for some strange reason I convinced myself that it was 1980.

I decided to hike up a nearby mountain. When I reached the top I think I hit the absolute peak of my trip. I looked down at the landscape before me and I could see what it looked like before civilization. The setting sun gave everything orange hue. I could see tall mountains with trees covering them, expansive rivers and lakes shimmering in the sunlight. Magnificent.

On the way down the clouds became very menacing. At first it was nothing. Then a giant dapper dogs head with a moustache, then a majesticely enormous UFO emerged from the clouds and it was coming straight at me! Luckily, my mind hadn't entered complete psychosis; I knew the hallucinations weren't real, so I didn't freak out or anything. I continued walking down the hill and into the urban expanse.

After about a half hour I got lost. My peripheral vision was acting up so I couldn't see around me to figure out where I was. I continued to walk through the different roads to try and find my way back to familiar territory, but all the roads and cul-de-sacs looked the same, so I was getting nowhere.

About an hour later I found my way back to the main road. I don't know if it was luck or muscle-memory or whatever, but I found my way out of the suburban jungle. Thank God.

After I got home I just sat down in the living room and watched Twin Peaks and The Deer Hunter. The acid was wearing off at this point, so nothing too cool happened, but it was still pretty unusual. The Deer Hunter movie felt like it lasted 5+ hours, the background colors all mixed and morphed into each other, and the features of the actors became greatly exaggerated.

Twin Peaks wasn't too bad. Some bits were a bit difficult for me to comprehend, but other than that it wasn't any different than watching it sober.

Any thoughts?

I took half a bar the day before yesterday and then rest of that bar at night so my tolerance may have been increased a bit. 

Coming to the main point, yesterday noon I had 3/4 of a bar and after a while I was driving to the mall for some shopping alone. One of my favorite songs came up and I went into this weird benzo trance state where I started remembering all my past traumas one by one. When the song ended something just hit me. There is no point of thinking about or getting anxious/sad about something that has happened. Nothing can be changed now. All you can do is not repeat your mistakes, instead learn from them and focus on the future and your current situation.

Now that it has worn off (at least most of it). Even if I think of the shit that has happened in the past, I feel relieved. I finally feel free after a long time. The guilt is almost/completely gone. Now I dont even feel like having the rest of the bars because I feel like it is going to go to waste since I have learned something from it and I would rather hold on to ongoing situations and solve them and not hide behind the safety net of benzos.

I did not expect to psychically alter the physical makeup of my ceiling, have a lengthy discussion with a plastic bag, or have my bed turn into a planet inhabited by ants to whom I was a god. Needless to say, I was surprised when all of that happened. After that experience I took Jenkem almost every night for a few weeks and tripped hard each time. At the time of the experience I am about to relate, I’m sure a good amount of the drug had built up in my system. This may or may not have had an effect. 

Every time before this when I took the drug I was happy to just lie in bed and let it take its course. The trips were always real to me, as in I didn’t view them as the effects of a drug. I saw the trips as reality and never thought it strange that the world was so completely different than usual. I would let the experience burn out and then usually fall right to sleep, awaking perfectly sober feeling like a million bucks. This particular experience was different because I walked around out of bed and had brief moments where I knew I was tripping. It was also the last time I was able to trip on Jenkem. 

At around 10:00 pm I swallowed two 10mg pills with a glass of water and went to my bed. I lied down, ready for the trip to begin. After maybe ten minutes I decided to throw caution to the wind and swallowed two more pills with a glass of milk. This was more than I had ever done in one night. I ate a few slices of sliced turkey to kill the taste (Jenkem has a very bitter taste and dissolves quickly in my mouth into powdery grossness) then got back in bed. 

I was not aware of when the trip began. One second I was lying in bed perfectly sober, the next I was hanging suspended from the edge of an infinitely tall cliff over a gigantic chasm of utter darkness. I was inside a huge sack woven from golden yarn. The sack was being pulled up the side of the cliff slowly by an unseen force, but since the cliff was infinitely tall I knew I would never reach the top. I could see the brown cliff wall through many holes in the sack and I could look down into the darkness beneath me. I was not afraid of the height nor of possibly falling. It was a very pleasant feeling being suspended over nothingness inside a golden bag. 

Then I became aware that a religious figure, Lilith, was in the bag with me. I have great respect for Lilith and the strong feminine nature she represents. I have had dreams before with Lilith involved and so was not surprised to see her with me in the bag. We did not talk, instead she communicated with me telepathically and I spoke to her with a series of guttural coughs. She told me that I could raise the bag or lower it with my mind, so I raised it up and found an entire community of bag-dwellers dangling a few yards above me. I raised the bag to be beside them. There were maybe five or six bags like my own held close together by dew-laden spider webs. I couldn’t see the people inside, just their silhouettes. I spoke with them for awhile using the guttural cough language and they spoke to me by inhaling at different rhythms. 

Then the bag went away and I realized it was just my afghan, pulled over my head. I was still lying in bed. Lilith, the bag-dwellers, the cliff, and the dark chasm were all gone. I thought the trip was over so I got up and went to the kitchen. I was thirsty and wanted a soda. I’m not sure if this brief moment of reality was due to the ten minutes I spent between doses, but it didn’t last long. 

I realized about halfway to the kitchen that I felt really drunk. The room started spinning around and the shapes made by objects in the room started melting into each other. Everything was outlined with rainbows and any lights (digital clock readouts, mainly, since it was night time) left brilliant tracers. It was like taking a low dose of mushrooms, basically, except I didn’t think it was strange at all, nor did I find it to be beautiful. It was just perfectly normal. 

Before I got to the kitchen I had to pass a counter where we keep fruit and a few candy jars. I looked at the counter and saw a hundred or so tiny men standing on it all dressed in solid black clothes. They were frantically trying to get the counter to balance itself as it was teetering over a giant fall (the distance between the counter and the floor, for the tiny men, a fatal plunge). Some of the men had already fallen, and some were hanging over the pit, desperately clinging to the edge with their hands. I decided to help the little guys. I pushed the counter away from the pit with all my might, but for some reason my force was reversed and the counter actually bent closer to falling. The room was still spinning around and I kept wobbling on my feet as I pushed at the counter. The little men started yelling at me and cursing me for interfering. I kept pushing the counter but it just kept tilting further towards the fall. I suddenly got the brilliant idea of pulling it, since if pushing it made it fall then pulling it would make it steady out. So, I pulled the counter towards me with all my might and it fell straight down to the floor. All the little men disappeared. 

I then noticed a shadow on the wall was watching me. It looked like a tall man in a large trench coat’s shadow. I got a strong feeling of paranoia when I saw the Shadowman. I thought he was there to steal my memories. I saw that he had Lilith in his clutches and was pulling her into the wall. I jumped at him to attack him and save Lilith but they vanished into the wall before I could grab them. 

I ran into the kitchen and looked out a ‘window’ (the next day I realized the ‘window’ was actually a stained glass ornament hung on the wall) to see Shadowman speed off into the night in an old car. I tried to phase change into a gas to pass through the window but it didn’t work. I felt angry and sad that Lilith had been kidnapped. 

I felt a strong need to urinate, so I went to the bathroom. On the way there a woman’s face appeared out of the wall. The best way to describe her is the ‘Anti-Lilith’, or the embodiment of everything Lilith was not. I thought she was ridiculously evil, and I made an angry face at her and yelled at her to go away. She laughed at me and disappeared. 

I don’t remember entirely what occurred in the bathroom but I know I spoke to my reflection for a good deal of time on many different, interesting subjects. I think I remember seeing an owl flying around the bathroom ceiling. 

I went back out into the hall and saw Shadowman standing by the door. He vanished immediately. I remembered I had some cigarettes in my car and went out to the apartment parking lot to get them. Before I ventured outside I made absolutely sure I was sober (I wasn’t at all) so that no one would suspect anything. This was the second time I had some idea that the experience was not real. I took a flashlight and my car keys. It was easy to find them on a cluttered table. 

I got the cigarettes out of my car. Electric blue manta rays were swimming around my feet as I walked back to the apartment. I tried to find my lighter on the same table I got the flashlight and keys from but this time it was nearly impossible. The entire room was tilting in the opposite direction every time I bent my body at all. Since I was bending over a table and moving around it looking for a tiny lighter, the room was spinning out of control. I finally found the lighter amongst the strange objects littering the table and went outside. I smoked a couple cigarettes while the manta rays swam around. I saw some shadow children standing by a car and shined the flashlight at them. They disappeared into smoke. 

I came back inside feeling sober again and decided to write in my online journal. As I typed I couldn’t understand why the letters were able to stay at the top of the page. Why didn’t they fall down to the bottom and break? I saw a car’s headlights coming through the Venetian blinds, cut into slivers of light, turn into an invading army of barbarians and for a moment I left my body and served as their general before dropping back into myself. In the time spent writing in my journal I had a few of these out of body experiences where I became part of one of my own hallucinations. After a time, I noticed a shadow crawling up my back and looking over my shoulder. It was Lilith, turned into a shadow person, reading what I was writing. 

Here is the unedited entry from my journal that night:

Soon after writing that I fell asleep. I woke up in the morning feeling completely sober and like I had just had the best sleep of my life. 

After that experience, every time I took Jenkem I almost immediately passed out. I have not since been able to trip on Jenkem. I really miss its effects.

The both of us have never tried it, but he knows many people who have had really bad experiences with it. 
He is traumatized, because his ex lover who is a frequent G user molested him, while he was sober and she was tripping. 
I didn’t believe him first. She was a close friend of his, also someone he had hooked up with, so it didn’t make any sense for me that she was able to molest him. 
He told me that it was because of the drug, that she was very aggressively grabbing his crotch and throwing herself onto him. They were in a club, so that made the situation even more uncomfortable.
According to him, she also doesn’t remember anything, so he never spoke with her about it. He just cut her off and overall stopped talking to her. I believe him! 
Some of our friends sometimes use G, when partying. They seem to have a lot of fun, while still appearing clear minded. 
I also got offered to take some, which caused a huge fight. That’s when he told me about his trauma. 

I mean there are worse things happening rn than me never taking that drug... just want to hear your opinions on this.

For about 45 minutes now I've been feeling light headed, nausea, anxious, seem to have weak /sluggish legs, brain fog and poor memory, and poor muscle coordination in my arms and hands. 

I've also started getting a bit of muscle twitching as well in sporadic places in my torso.

Aside from the gaba and the edible, I have taken some herbal cortisol manager from Integratic Therapeutics and a Valerian root extract 500mg. 2 nights ago I took 15mg of Temazepam.

As soon as I graduated with a GED and a bachelor's degree in Plastering Tech I went straight back to my old lady Mary Jane. Since then I got back on meth because I was homeless, did acid for the first time, quit meth because of the acid, did salvia once, and now I'm becoming friends with my fungal neighbors. Now that the background's out of the way, here's the point of the post. After I graduated job corps and after I did acid a couple of times, I would take a fat bong rip or dab and as I'm coughing my ass off I started feeling the world spin and noises blurred together to make one big noise that would die down in a few seconds. That happened after too big of hits for a while and I attributed it to being a cigarette smoker and coughing too hard, I was 21 then. The years go by and I've quit smoking cigarettes, I'm subsisting off of garden veggies that I grow and I'm stuck inside because of quarantine so I meditate more often as a way to pass the time. But now when I smoke pot it doesn't have to be a big hit. If I take a decent reasonable hit I get a feeling as if my atoms are vibrating in tune with everything around me. My hearing dims and the world quiets, my vision oscillates so I close my eyes after I cough twice and take a big breath in. I'm washed over in euphoria as my awareness if my body slips away and I start to gain insights and exist in a void for a few seconds and I just experience being for two minutes. I come back quickly in the conventional sense but to me I feel every single moment merge into the next at its own pace converging into a reality where I am a human man with a red beard and a big red dog named Rufus and I smile, say ""well that was trippy"" and then go about my day in the time it takes to brush your teeth.  I just want to know if there's any one else who smokes a lot of weed who experiences the same thing. Because if that's not the case and it's not hypothetically endogenous 5-meO- DMT, then it's probably a brain tumor that I should probably remove.

UNLESS ITS THE ONE TIME I DON'T WANT TO HOLE.   


I got some fire chunky stuffs recently, and it was cleaner than my usual cop, but it wasn't some crazy shit, just above average. I was hanging out at the house, and probably went through .5 in an hour or so, I was very rocked but not K-holing, which was nice because I rarely even get very rocked now, more so wobbly and wonky after about a half gram

Well, after it was worn off, I went to a friends house (I made sure I was sober before I left, DWI isn't the move), and had about \~.3 left. I took two spoonfuls, probably about 150-200mgs, and took a gravity bong hit once i got there. 

Fast forward 5 minutes, I can't see anything. My friend has DxM experience so he knows dissociation, but he's not a K user, and usually, I don't like being too rocked in front of people not familiar with it, because it looks like you're straight up dying, or you act so weird in the hole that it mimics a psychosis to a ""T"". My goal was just to feel a bit floaty, as I dont drink much and I figured if I took twice as much earlier there would be no way I'd hole, I didn't even think it a possibility! Well.. I had about 2 minutes to warn him I wouldn't understand a thing he was saying for an hour.... It probably came out as something like ""dgfsuijdhfoa boutto kholebruh fuck sorry""

WELP, too late for that! In 10 minutes, a dose \~30% of what I took earlier took me completely out of my body, rolling around on my friends floor, completely suprised that I was able to hole off just 200mgs, when there are times I can go through a whole ball in a 24 hour period, of similar quality, and max out at being really rocked/ playing with the acute psychosis a K binge brings.

I came back and was semi lucid about an hour after, and later tried another 300mgs at home, and didn't come close to holing.

So, my question is,  

Does anyone else seem to only be able to hole at the worst times (maily applies to chronic users of K, when I had a low tolerance I could hole easily)? Mine include: a pool resort, a friend who doesn't fuck with K, a korean barbeque, visiting a friend in the hospital (yeah that was NOT the best time), and various other terrible times. Any time I try for a hole in the places that would be best suited for it, I just can't seem to hole! Is it the amnesia? Is it the unfamilar enviornment that causes more external dissociation? 

TLDR: took .5 of k at home, no hole, took .2 of K at friends/enviornment where holing is not optimal, completely k hole for an hour. Anyone else have this happen?

This is my first tripreport so please don't be to hard on me :)

I just want to share this story. This has definitely been one of my best experiences ever but would not recommend this if you are not feeling a 1000% comfortable with being on acid.. Me and my mate used acid in some sticky situations and we trust eachother 10000%

About a year ago me and my mate. Me and my mate were planning on doing an acid trip. So we decided to go to the zoo..

we arrived at the zoo and we walked into the woods and took our tabs (I think it was between 90-125 Ug). 

We entered the zoo and started just looking around. We were really nervous so we decided to just sit down, have a fag and let everything just happen.

We started having that crawling feeling, people that use acid know what I mean. Like there are little bugs under your skin and its just tickling a lot. We started getting more relaxed and decided to take a look at the tigers. Fuck.... We heard something we did not want to hear at all. We heard children, not one not two but a whole f*king group. I started stressing out a bit so I asked my mate to just sit somewhere. While I was walking there was a disabled guy in a wheelchair. And I had to move myself in a weird way against the window where the tiger was leaning against as well. At this moment I felt like I was so close to this tiger that I could pet him. This took me out of it for atleast 25 seconds. After that my mate grabbed my hand and we slowely walked off.

While me and my mate had a fag we were sitting on a little bench and we were just smoking our fag. 
When we had 2 hits of our fag an employee of the zoo came over to us and told us 'you are not allowed to smoke there, there are white circles on the floor. Those are little smoking area's) We deeply apologized but after that point we realized, we are out of it. We had to find a white circle on the floor while our whole world was one weird colourfull circle so this was a job and a half. It took us about 15 minutes and we probably passed 10 of those circles but we could finally smoke our fag. After our fag we decided to explore the zoo a bit more, we started to get on our peak but we wanted to peak in the aquarium. 

First destination was the butterfly garden.
The butterfly garden was mental, absolutely crazy, it was colourfull and also super hot. We were sweating and I saw my sweat turn into butterflies and It felt like I walked in the middle of a jungle. While I tried to make a picture of one of the butterflies I felt my world making a •360. You know the sound of a rusty mechanism. It went to the left and to the right. I am not sure if my head moved but my whole eyesight got blurred and it just made a full on circle both directions. I thought I had to throw up so I told my mate this and we had to look for a toilet. 
Trying to find a toilet in a butterfly garden isn't easy so my mate sat down with me on a rock and about 50 butterflies were all over my shoulders. I forgot the feeling of throwing up and started to play carefully with the butterflies. 1 stayed on my finger for the full walk in the garden. My mate wanted to go to the next area so we carefully left all the butterflies and made our way to the next destination while we were on our way I got a phone call. Fuck its my teacher.... I picked up the phone and barely remember what I was talking about. I think I even called im Darlin a couple of times and told him how beautiful the animals are. But luckily he did not remind me of the conversation ever again

Next destination is the toilet
The toilet? Yes the toilet, this was maybe the trippiest bit of the day because after the butterfly garden we ended up outside. I accidentally tried to enter a staff area what did not work. While we were outside it started absolutely pissing down with rain. And not just a little bit, it felt like a tornado. If you ever experienced rain and wind on acid. It was exactly how you expect it. We went to the toilet and we both sat down and we leaked big time in the toilet. We literally thought the toilet was taking us to another dimension. It was time travelling us to history and back into the future. After we laughed for about 5 minutes and realised how lucky we were nobody came in we went out of the toilet and the sun was shining wonderfully again. Onto the next destination

The birds
Birds are something special, mega colourfull and not only the bird was alive but their skin and their wings were alive as well. This bit was especially super weird with the visuals, constant waves of colours flying around you but it did not value my trip experience much. I think its because I am not a massive bird fan and it just did not hit me as much as the other animals did. We stayed here for about 5/10 minutes and went to our favourite place

The aquarium
The aquarium was ridiculous, it felt like qe were going into our second peak. This peak made me feel smaller then ive ever been. We started walking, but the aquarium in this zoo had a cave system. This system is a one way system but we still managed to get completely lost. Out of the blue I was eye to eye with a massive fish. It looked straight at me and I could not look at it for too long because I did not want the fish to tell everyone I was tripping balls. I turned around and saw nothing. Nothing? Yea nothing. I asked my mate yo, do you see anything here? And oir visuals started becoming crazy. We were just about able to read the info sheet next to it and it were glow in the dark fish. This was so trippy that we thought the whole aquarium was just full of rainbow coloured glow in the dark glitter fishes. This was absolutely mental. 

When we got out of the aquarium the zoo was about to close but we wanted to see the monkeys still, we could hear them scream from a distance what sounded like they were trying to take over the world. i told my mate I was quite scared to get taken over by the apes and we decided the chill in a hammock for a bit. I closed my eyes and felt a bit of a Khole feeling coming in. I became a little dot and started doing an obstacle course, i was moving my head left and right. I opened my eyes and my mate was ready to walk. I was still quite dizzy but I drank some juice and felt so much more fresh. We took a little look at the monkeys but it was such an overruling energy that it made us really restless. We had the whole zoo, on our way back we saw some polarbears and penguins. But they did not pay any attention to anyone so we just let them chill while we slowly made our way back to the bus. We did not really keep track on time. We were about 4 hours in our trip when we got into the bus. 

In the bus I experienced my 3 or 4th peak. All the people looked at me, even the busdriver. It was a really busy bus so it was mega uncomfortable. I saw peoples necks break to look me straight in the eyes and my mate saw me struggle a little bit. Ive seen those things before but no matter how much u see it. It is never a good time at a point like that. 

We got out of the bus and we felt really trippy still we decided to go sit in the park and have a couple of fags and a spliff. At rhis point that seemed exactly what we needed. We smoked and ate and enjoyed our fruit. We had amazing conversation and we solved problems like we never did before. After a few fags we ofcourse had a bit of the munchies so we went to Macdonalds and I ate quite a bit (alot while on acid). The rest of the day we just talked about our experiences and we blazed the evening away and made our way home after.

I hope you enjoyed this story. 

Ive got quite a few cool stories on acid but my writing skills are just not that good. I hope someone can give me some tips and tricks.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,687529,public,confidence,self,Tripreport in the zoo,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hcd8wn/tripreport_in_the_zoo/,no_ads,0.0,1592645244.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have been legitimately prescribed 2mg of Xanax every day for 5 years for anxiety. In the beginning they definitely fucked me up, but I never abused them and for the remainder of the \~5 years the ""high"" completely disappeared.  They still worked very well for anxiety though. A year ago I decided that I wanted to get off of them for good due to the research that came out suggesting long term use can lead to cognitive deficits. I switched over to valium and tapered off of that in a 6 month period. For the past 6 months I have been completely Benzo free. 

Fast forward to to the other day I was moving houses and found 15, 2mg bars while unpacking. It is impossible for me to get my hands o these things so I said screw it why not try and have some fun while I still have the last of my Xanax that I found. 

Given I have been off of them for 6 months I took 5 bars (10mg) and figured it would either fuck me up or knock me out cold. On the contrary, I did not feel a single thing. It was like I took placebo pills. A week later I decided to double the dose and take 10 bars (20mg). Same exact thing, no effect whatsoever. I know it will be pretty much impossible for me to get my hands on benzos again, but I was just hoping for 1 or 2 last highs before I wasn't able to source them as I do not like purchasing drugs illegally unless I get them from a pharmacy.

I find it hard to get really fucked on it and it doesn't fuck with your head as much as chloroform, it's mostly physical effects as far as I tried. It's pretty much like chloroform or alcohol, it gets harder to walk etc...
I ate a snack while fucked up and I ate it really fast and it didn't have that much taste because ether numbs you.

I'm coming down right now and I'm waiting to see if it's really addictive. Chloroform was making me compulsively redose A LOT and I'd usually huff for a while until I'd just get bored and sleep. While I somewhat wanted to huff more ether it's not nearly as bad (for now at least).

I spent the morning hiking and exploring a park in a pretty remote part of the state, as I was leaving the park I noticed two state troopers parked on the side of the road, I thought nothing of it as I was following all traffic laws at the time. As I continue on, a  few miles down the road I notice a car coming up on me, its a state trooper, and he's on my ass. I speed up a couple of miles per hour (70 in a 65), after a mile or two he lights me up and I pull into a road off the highway. Here's the thing, I had about half a gram of weed and 7-9 grams of shrooms in my car to do out in the desert. At this point, my heart is racing, however, I hope he just gives me a warning about speeding and sends me on my way. 

After giving him my license, registration, and insurance he says that he can smell campfire and weed on me (smoked \~12 hours prior) and asks if I had anything in the car, I deny everything, say I smoked a few days ago in a legal state, the smell must have stuck. He does the standard ""If you're honest now, it will only help you"" routine, but I maintain that there is nothing in the car to my knowledge. He informs me that his partner is coming with a K-9 to make sure I am telling the truth, as he says that the partner pulls in behind him so I know I have to stay. By now, I assume that I'm fucked and will be spending the night in an Idaho prison, proving to my parents that I'm the degenerate drug user they fear that I am. Low and behold the dog signals (I'm pretty sure they always do), but I hid the stuff pretty well so I am holding on the hope he fails to find it for dear life. He asks me to stand by his partner's vehicle, I make casual conversation with the officer and try to be polite as possible while the trooper ransacks my car. He finds the weed first, and a couple of minutes later he finds the shrooms. After searching the rest of the car he asks me to return to my car as he discusses with his partner. It felt like the longest 3 minutes of my life.

He returns to my window and asks me to step out of the vehicle, my heart sinks, I expect to hear my rights read to me. He leads me to the back of his squad car. He tells me that we're 90 miles away from the nearest facility to book me at, and taking me in for 2 misdemeanors would take up a lot of both of our time. He admonishes me for lying to him, mentioning that he's glad the dog did his job. He hands me the weed and the shrooms and tells me to pour them out and crush them in the dirt. I almost joyously carried out his instructions as it meant I would walk free. After I finish destroying the goods he scolds me again for lying to the police and tells me to dispose of the bags I kept everything in ASAP and tells me to have a good day and to be safe. I walk back to my car in disbelief, I feel like some cruel trick is being played on me, and that he will return in a few seconds to haul me away, but he drives off. I wait a couple of minutes to make sure he's gone, and I go over to the spot where I stomped on the shrooms, low-and-behold, there are several stems and caps fully intact, I grab a small handful, gulp them down and head on my merry way. I have never been so close to losing my freedom.

It’s not like I’m new to drug dealing but I want to scale back and have a more passive business with a more relaxed client base, where I can stay more anonymous

How do you launder money ? I employ 5 people from my estate to wash cars and only one of them knows it’s a laundering business. It’s not an ideal way to launder money what are some other ways without running a legit business ? Apparently you can fake inheritance or there are services out there which will launder money but they take something like a 20% cut. Also how do you explain to family and friends the money your making ? This is mainly how my parents discovered I was a drug dealer amongst other reasons

What drugs are most profitable, cheapest to buy, in most demand etc ? In terms of drugs to sell previously I have extracted mescaline and DMT and have tried to synthesise some of Shulgins drugs (it’s not as easy as you would think). All of that is time consuming so I believe buying xtc, 2cb, Xanax, Ket, LSD, DMT, Bromo-Dragonfly and THC vape liquid  of the darknet is the way to go. Also I’m attempting to grow shrooms, does anyone know if the yield is worth the effort ?

In the UK meth is very rare so its one of the most profitable drugs you can sell imo, as well as cooking H and whipping crack (never done this personally) but this is too risky, how do people manage to stay low key while selling this stuff ? As addicts won’t leave you alone and the feds dedicate all their time to trying to catch you. Can you sell harder drugs without becoming a rival to more violent dealers ? But mainly selling all those is immoral imo

I made a prior post about KFC and I did not mention that I was involved in running it, as I wanted to gather opinions about how efficient/risky it seemed, you all brought it to my attention how common this system of drug dealing is. After most people were fired I am planning on infiltrating my local Burger King, after learning from mistakes I previously made.

How do you stay anonymous when drug dealing ? This in my experience has been incredibly difficult but it’s important to me as many people in my life would question who I am if they found out, also people start attempting to rob you which is something I want to stay away from.

My final question, how do you manage employees ? As I can’t explain to them how dealing on a small scale is better for everyone, their making money and want to make more and will always want to move more weight, with no regard for the additional risks it brings.

I’ve been using adderall on and off over the last 5 or so years. In college I’d go on your usual binge, all nighters etc, used to love those...experiences zero problems. I’ve even did an experiment to see how long I could stay up and I lasted a week with literally 0 sides..barely any hallucinations either but that’s besides the point. I would never take them longer then a couple weeks but towards the end of college I was able to take them at least once a day 20-30mg with a day break. No issues during that time. 

After I graduated I took almost a year or so off of them, maybe a few here and there. However, just recently about 5 months ago I started taking them regularly with some binges and all nighters in between. Sometimes 160mg in 30 hours with a solid day or two breaks. Always make sure to get enough sleep, I track it daily.

Now as of recent I’ve been experiencing some weird effects on either the come down or after 5 hours...mostly once I try to get to sleep. I’ll have these mini panic attacks or something, my chest will get really tight, short breathing, I’ll get restless, start freaking out in my head but then I’ll eventually just pass out. The next morning I’ll wake up fine, my chest might still be a little tight but that’ll subside after an hour or so. Concentration is still solid, but motivation is somewhat below average..but that’s always been why I take addy. I get bored easily or distracted. Also, during these symptoms my heart rate will be normal too which is strange, I have a daily resting heart rate of around 70-80.

Where I had been sober for two years through AA. Even though I had a job, “friends” (rehab people get shady time to time) and a home, I was extremely unhappy. I had no idea why this huge wave of depression had hit me like a brick wall, but I was terrified and wanted answers. Therapy wasn’t working, I couldn’t meditate for the life of me, and I started to lose sleep in a constant state of catatonic depression. One faithful day, one of my co-workers had invited me to her birthday party. I felt like it would be good for me to get away and have some fun for a change, even if I don’t get completely focked. When I showed up, there were drugs, everywhere. Coke, whippets, E, Cid, Mushies. As far as the eye can see. At that moment I had remembered all the rumors I had heard of Bill Wilson, the founder of AA, taking acid before and having a spiritual awakening, so I had decided why not? I mean it doesn’t pop on tests anyway. 2 hits of liquid sunshine and 45/60 I had the most overwhelming sense of peace, tranquility, and understanding for the universe and all of its expressions. I remember the first thing I described being feeling as if I was in third person. I later found out through almost a year of deep meditation and spiritual study that I was experiencing a sneak peak of enlightenment. This substance didn’t solve my problems, but it taught me how to solve my own problems, by showing me what was wrong and giving me the motivation to face my fears.

Im like a brother/friend/dad to him which is not good because I’m a terrible role model, I’ve sold coke and heroin, used most drugs and I am an all round terrible person to look up to.

A while back I contributed to helping a group import and  introduce meth to the area, I’m in the UK where it’s incredibly rare so it’s very profitable if you can distribute it. Not only did a friend of mine get addicted and then ruined his life, my own brother is using it now. He’s also become a drug dealer and I’ve seen pictures of him holding rambo knives and flexing drugs. He’s literally making all the mistakes I’ve made and I never should of tried to look after him as I’ve only normalised drugs and violence. I never thought the consequences of my drug dealing would effect my brother and I have payed all the dealers to leave my bro alone but he still obtains it. I can’t go back and stop my friends from selling meth but I can stab any dealer I find to be selling it to anyone I know

Meth is toxic stay away from it I’m responsible for introducing a drug to my hometown which destroys everyone who comes into contact with it. Not that everything else I’ve sold isn’t harmful

My brother denies using it just like my friend did and he disappears for days at a time, I couldn’t help my friend so I probably can’t help my brother. Obviously this is karma for helping people bring meth into the area (although I never sold any, I quit after trying it). He also subtly vapes it like no one notices he’s getting high on meth ffs. Every week the situation gets a little worse

Ever since I have been trying to do acid for a while now, I have heard so many great things about it, the only problem was no matter how hard i tried I could never get it. So I was chilling in my room one night and I got a text from this goth girl who used to go to my school, we weren't really friends but we knew each other and smoked maybe once or twice together. She messaged me on sc saying her friend was selling 400 ug tabs and asked if I wanted to buy, I said yes and got super excited. I bought the tab the next day and my stepbrother agreed to be my tripsitter. We waited til our parents fell asleep and went down to the hangout room in the basemnt, I hung up a black light and put on a rap/hip hop playlist on youtube on the small tv that we had down there. I took the tab around 9:50 and swallowed it around 10:03, after an hour I noticed patterns and the ground began to slightly move similar to shrooms once they start to kick in. I was having a good trip and at around 3 in the morning we both snuck out to have a cigarette, for some reason I was fiending for nic and smoked 3 cigs in a row. When we went back in, my stepbrother said he was tired and wanted to fall asleep. I thought that since I was already having a good trip I wouldn't be able to have a bad one. After my stepbro fell asleep, I pulled out my dab pen and stupidly took like 7 to 8 hits. 

I was vibing to some chill music video by lil uzi and then I noticed the walls started melting and got a little scared because I could feel myself melting too and I didnt like it and got scared, and then it hit me that I was having a bad trip. I tried to wake up my stepbrother and I was telling him I was having a bad trip, but he was half asleep and just said ""dude chill out you'll be fine"". I was freaking out so I called my friend and asked to facetime, he said he couldn't but he said one of my other friends wanted to talk and see how the trip was going. I got on facetime with him and he basically became my tripsitter (he was really chill because he was off the hydros) he helped me calm down and talked to me. One thing about the night that I remember were the walls, the walls would constantly change from 4 stages, one stage was there were mouths on the wall biting at each other, another stage was  kaleidoscopes on the wall, another stage was just the walls completely turning to slime and melting ( everytime this stage appeared caused me to feel like I was melting so I would take deep breaths to help come myself down and my friend on facetime helped me with it ), and the other stage which was the worst one was the bug stage, just letting y'all know I am TERRIFIED of bugs, even the most harmless like ants and butterflies, I've just been so creeped out by them ever since I was a kid. And on this stage, the wall would change to a bunch of flies/ flying beetles on the wall and they would swarm on me and start biting me, everytime this happened I did the same thing I did when the walls and I started melting, I would take deep breaths and then the walls would go to the next stage. And I remember the whole night, I felt like I was the vibe of the room and my goal was to not piss off the room. After my friend left Facetime to go to bed, I started having a bad trip again. So I go on my chromebook and started looking up how to stop bad trips, but I couldn't even focus on what the sites where saying cause all the letters were moving and shifting. I ended up just putting on some happy or uplifting show on the TV which helped calm me down. 

After that night, I had afterglow the whole day next day and it was terrible. The only thing that I'm confused about is what caused me to have a bad trip, whether it's the fact that I got high as shit while on 400 ug of acid, the fact that my tripsitter fell asleep, or the fact that I started thinking about having a bad trip. Anyway, lesson of the story is do NOT take 400 ug for your first time, it was scary as hell. The best way I can describe how a bad trip feels is like a bad dream that you cant get out of .",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,687467,public,confidence,self,I had a bad trip my first time taking acid,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hc6n23/i_had_a_bad_trip_my_first_time_taking_acid/,no_ads,0.0,1592622232.0,Psychedelics,,,,,,,,,,1592593654.0,,,,,,,

i remember hearing kratom is a bit hard on the liver which honestly scares the fuck out of me. kratom is eerily effective at treating my anxiety, my depression and it really helps with my motivation. i take 2 grams at a time, most of the time it’s twice a day, once after i wake up, and once a few hours before bed, lately ive just been doing 2 grams in the morning

basically i wanted to know if the pros outweigh the cons, and also i wanna know exactly how harsh it is on the liver, and if i should be worried, bc if it’s super harsh i think i might just live with crippling anxiety and depression haha

So it came in the mail a couple days ago and me and some friends go and try it out at one of their apartments. All 4 of us take about 150mg and about an hour later they asked me if I wanted to smoke. To start, I’m not a big smoker, I usually don’t smoke but when I do it’s very little. So they bring out a bong and we did a couple bowls. After that it’s going good, feeling great, but I’m not really feeling high, almost like I’m immune to weed. 

Another hour goes by and we decide we should redose and we all take another 50mg under the tongue (taste terrible btw). Another 20 minutes goes by and we decide to smoke again. Between the 3 of us smoking we probably did another 3-4 bowls, which again, is absolutely insane for me considering I don’t really smoke at all. At this point, I’m still not really feeling that high which is weird and then all of a sudden it hits me like a train.

I open my eyes and it’s almost like I’m in another dimension, I felt like I wasn’t really there in that room. It’s kinda hard to explain but it felt like I was alone in that room talking to myself, but I could still see my friends. Whenever I talked, it sounded like I was trapped in this metal box just talking to a wall. My friends start to get worried because my eyes are wide open and start to getting extremely twitchy and cross eyed. I take a deep breath and I’m just thinking to myself, what in the world is going on, I’m not here right now and this is not me. Now the cool part is when I closed my eyes. I had very vivid closed eye visuals. I was able to turn into whatever I wanted, go wherever I wanted, and be whatever I wanted. It almost felt like a dream that I was in complete control of.

So I’m sitting on the couch holding this water bottle, and the first visual I kept having was when I closed my eyes, I turned into this giant king made of stone. Since I was holding a water bottle, in my visual, it was a giant stone sword and I was looking over a large city. Very vivid visual. At this time I have headphones in and I’m listing to deep house music and it sounded great. I go and walk on the balcony with my friends and lean over the railing, when I closed my eyes I just became the DJ playing for a huge crowd with lights and fog and all the cool stuff. It felt so real and it happened multiple times out there. The next major visual I had was I was looking over at my 2 friends standing on the balcony and when I closed my eyes, we were in some Russian country on top of this snowy building, and my 2 friends were wearing these badass Spetsnaz uniforms with snipers looking down over the building. It almost looked like a call of duty campaign mission. I had a few other small visuals but they weren’t as vibrant or cool.

It was a warm summer night at a friends house party. I had planned to do some MDMA, since I hadn't done it in a while, wanted to forget about all the shit that was going wrong in my life at that moment and just enjoy myself for a little while. A friend of mine, that I hadn't seen in a long time, was also rolling and decided to upgrade to a candyflip. Because this was at the peak of my high, I thought fuck it, the world is perfect, nothing can go wrong and decided to drop some acid as well. Huge mistake.  

I blacked out pretty much right then and there and have almost no memories of the next 6 hours. I don't even remember taking the acid. According to my friends, we were talking about some shit, when I randomly brought up boats for no reason, after which they were trying to get me to list three types of boats, to find out if I still even knew what a boat was. I couldn't do it. I kept mentioning anything and everything but boats. In the end, I managed to list one boat: a soul boat. Don't ask me what a soul boat is, but my friends decided that that was good enough. 

The next few hours I was just stuck in a continous loop where my friends tried to explain to me that I'm tripping, which I then forgot again ten minutes later. There were some moments of clarity mixed in between apparently, but I just went right back into the loop afterwards.

Eventually, I finally got out of the loop when we decided to go outside. I think the change of location as well as the fresh air helped a lot. This is when I start to remember things again, but I was still really confused. One of my first memories is us going down the stairs and me being scared that they were like those infinite stairs from Mario 64. 

As my mind slowly started to return I was just so fucking scared that I had fucked up my brain permanently, especially because my friends all looked so worried (understandably). I also had really strange visuals, everything was made out of blue red and green dots, kind of like the pixels on a computer screen, and it just all really fucked with me.

We went back upstairs after I failed to roll a blunt. The party had calmed down since it was like 6 am at this point and most people were just chilling and listening to The Little Prince on audiobook in the bedroom. I joined them, but just couldn't get comfortable anywhere. Probably annoyed the hell out of everyone by constantly moving around lol. 

I found a nice spot up on a bunk bed, but after not talking to anyone for a while I got really paranoid that the audio book wasn't actually an audio book, but my thoughts being broadcasted and everybody else was listening in on them. So I stared down from this bunk bed at all these people who just want to chill, trying to discern from their faces whether they were hearing my thoughts. Must have been really fucking freaky seeing me scared as fuck staring at all of their faces, like some kind of gargoyle lmao

I didn't get any sleep, but my sanity eventually returned. I'm still pretty ashamed of that night, especially since I can't remember all of the stupid shit I must have done and said, but at least it was a sufficient wake up call that I finally got my shit together. As cliché as it is, I enrolled back in college. So far my grades are good enough that I'm fairly convinced that I don't have any serious brain damage. 

I'm still sometimes scared that I'm not as smart as I was before, but kindness and hardwork is more important than intelligence anyway so fuck it.

So ya that's all, stay in school and don't do unplanned candyflips kids.

Opened the envelope I found out I got 8 rivotril 2m although I only ordered 6 lol.

Anyways, I had a beer and then took 0.5mg. Cracked up a second one and watched a movie.
Two hours later I took 0.5mg and drank another beer. Somehow I remembered I had a bit of my AVB I vaped in February. 

Haven‘t touched it since because Weed almost ever made me anxious and paranoid as fuck. When I smoke with friends and take only one hit from a joint I already got anxious, even if I had a beer before. And when I smoke by myself I only can get decent high but still be anxious.
Then I went to the nearest woods to smoke a joint and enjoying nature. I wanted to end the j when there was still half of it because the comeup always made me experience anxiety more than after the comeup.

But somehow I didn‘t give a shit and I smoked the whole joint. I was so fucking high walking home through a park and it was just as great as when I smoked weed in the beginning, I enjoyed every second of it.

Right now I am laying on my couch struggling really hard to write this post haha.

Maybe not necessarily the drugs themselves. Of course I love the perceived effects and the effects everyone else experiences but for me it’s more about the culture. Weed culture, hippy culture, rave culture, just generally the lifestyles, experiences, and coming together-ness of drugs. Now in my younger teen years I’ve smoked a lot of weed, did a few psychedelics, and generally tried to do just about every drug once (Outside of crack, meth, heroin, etc.). I’ve found that cocaine and any psychedelics are generally my favorites and weed was my main social activity. 

Unfortunately for me as I’ve approached the ass end of my teens I’ve started to develop schizophrenia. It’s mostly mild and doesn’t interrupt my daily life but when I do certain drugs it gets really bad. Nowadays weed makes me paranoid and like everyone is out to get me and my last experience with psychedelics made me honestly believe I was trapped in a tv show and was about to die. I couldn’t even control my mind or body outside of the occasional “I can’t even think” comment. 

This deeply saddens me because I love the cultures and people associated with these drugs so much and are the only ones I feel at home in. I don’t know how I’m supposed to continue embracing these cultures without you know partaking in one of the main focus points that make the culture.

Hi, I'm sorry if this is not the right subreddit for this but I have to ask some questions.

I have no experience with RC's and recently I've been toying with the idea of ordering some from the clearnet.

I live in EU and I haven't found any domestic site, but there are plenty of EU sites.

Problem is, I haven't found any information aboud the legal satus of RC's in my country and idk how to feel about that.

I  was thinking, If I order small quantities (0.1g etc), pay with bitcoin  and stay away from relatively well-known/grey area RC's like 1p-lsd I  should be all right?

I know I won't get in serious trouble for ordering RC's but I rly don't want them to be seized or something.

It’s not like I’m new to drug dealing but I want to scale back and have a more passive business with a more relaxed client base, where I can stay more anonymous

How do you launder money ?. I employ 5 people from my estate to wash cars and only one of them knows it’s a laundering business. It’s not an ideal way to launder money what are some other ways without running a legit business ? Apparently you can fake inheritance or there are services out there which will launder money. Also how do you explain to family and friends the money your making ? This is mainly how my parents discovered I was a drug dealer amongst other reasons

What drugs are most profitable, cheapest to buy, in most demand etc ? In terms of drugs to sell previously I have extracted mescaline and DMT and have tried to synthesise some of Shulgins drugs (it’s not as easy as you would think). All of that is time consuming so I believe buying xtc, 2cb, Xanax, Ket, LSD, DMT, Bromo-Dragonfly and THC vape liquid  of the darknet is the way to go. Also I’m attempting to grow shrooms, does anyone know if the yield is worth the effort ?

In the UK meth is very rare so its one of the most profitable drugs you can sell imo, as well as cooking H and whipping crack (never done this personally) but this is too risky, how do people manage to stay low key while selling this stuff ? As addicts won’t leave you alone and the feds dedicate all their time to trying to catch you. Can you sell harder drugs without becoming a rival to more violent dealers ? 

I made a prior post about KFC and I did not mention that I was involved in running it, as I wanted to gather opinions about how efficient/risky it seemed, you all brought it to my attention how common this system of drug dealing is. After most people were fired I am planning on infiltrating my local Burger King, after learning from mistakes I previously made.

How do you stay anonymous when drug dealing ? This in my experience has been incredibly difficult but it’s important to me as many people in my life would question who I am if they found out, also people start attempting to rob you which is something I want to stay away from.

My final question, how do you manage employees ? As I can’t explain to them how dealing on a small scale is better for everyone, their making money and want to make more and will always want to move more weight, with no regard for the additional risks it brings.

Started from oxycontins, but they were too damn expensive here where I live so I switched to Subutex(buprenorphine). I have an addict brain, so it didn't take long till I used subutex daily; little lines every now and then.

The fun stopped quickly and when I tried to quit buprenorphin, I just never could get past 10 days. I've been using it daily for a year now just to keep the withdrawal symptoms away and my mood up. Minimun dose/day, about 0,4mg or so nasally. The dose is so ridiculously low, but I just can't cut tthe head of the snake; the w/d symptoms are too much. 

No one knew about my opioid use, and I never really fell to the bottom. I had mental health probIems that lead to the usage, but they are under control now. I have a much better life nowadays and the drug is just a nuisance that keeps me mentally and physically chained.

Due to the corona virus, buprenorphine is literally extinct from the streets in my country, so I had to make the decision to go cold turkey. Did my last 0,1mg line on Monday morning, and I've been clean for about 110 hours now. The problem is that the critical w/d symptoms won't go away; chills, intense sweating and so on. 

How long till the chills ans sweating stop? I'm okay with the depression and muscle aches, but I can't stand these critical w/d symptoms much longer. I met a sober woman a little over month ago, and our thing started absolutely great. She wants to meet me more and more often, but I cannot show up like this. I think I can't tell her I'm withdrawing from opioids because I doubt she'd take it too well. Another mental setback like that would make me use again. 

I made a couple posts over a year ago considering the same topic. The difference is that then I didn't have any real will to stop, but now after I've seen where this goes, I have a genuine will to quit forever. It's my addict brain that tells me otherwise. I cannot go to the doctor since a drug addict mark would ruin my life and career and haunt me for the rest of my life. No one knows, and I want to keep it that way.

I'm 28 years old, and I dislike pills very much. I drink and smoke, but have/would never touch pills. I have personal reasons why, coupled with feeling like we live in a society where people are fueled by pills and using them for an answer for everything. I got my tooth pulled a few years back and my dentist asked if I needed a painkiller prescription. When I told him a prescription for some strong ibuprofen would be fine, he looked visibly shocked. I'm not trying to act like a tough guy, it really didn't hurt at all. In fact the tool he used to pry it out was stretching the corner of my lips, which were dry as fuck, hurt more than anything. If I was ever in any serious pain, I would 100% take painkillers. 

My mom said I was diagnosed with ADD at a young age, but she didn't want to put me on medication. She wasn't comfortable with it. And just to note, she didn't tell me this until I was maybe 19-20. I don't blame her at all, but sometimes I wish I tried it. School was difficult for me. And not because it was hard to learn or understand things, but because obviously, I couldn't stay focused. I hear friends say ""I have ADHD/ADD"" all the time, but I don't think a lot of people know how infuriating it is. I can't stop my mind from wandering. I tried as hard as I could in school and would think to myself ""Stay focused on what the teacher is talking about"". And then ***snap***. 3 minutes just passed, and I don't know what the fuck was said in that 3 minutes. And what's more, I can't even remember what I was hearing or looking at. And it's not that I become blind or deaf, but more like my thoughts are so far off that I'm not even paying attention to what's around me. I'm not sure if that is normal or not, but I'm going to get back to that later. 

My girlfriend has noticed my behavior through the years we've been together. She catches me zoning out now and again and usually snaps me out of it, but one time she recorded it. I was playing a game on my computer and I was in the middle of a loading screen, I stared at the screen for almost 5 minutes. She stopped recording the moment I snapped out of it. Watching that video was so fucking creepy for me. I just stared blankly at the screen. Like someone who lost their mind. My GF said it was funny at first, but started to worry her. And it's not just the long zone outs that are bothersome. I'll be in a conversation with someone and they will say a certain word that will remind me of something and make my mind shoot off into a random thought. And boom, 5 seconds went by. And missing 5 seconds of a conversation is enough to make a person have to ask someone to repeat themselves. It happens to me daily, but I've always accepted that. Or maybe I've just ignored it.

**The reason I want to try it** is for something I was always scared was going to happen. Me zoning out while driving. Spoiler alert, nothing bad happened, thankfully. I was on a 25 mph neighborhood road and I spaced for maybe 3 seconds. A horn honking is what snapped me back. I swerved and just missed the curb on my side of the road. It might not seem like a big deal, because I didn't wreck and nothing was damaged, but it terrifies me knowing that I can lose my focus that easily. I wasn't checking a text or looking at someone on the sidewalk. I was looking straight at the road, and even when my car started to pull to the right and the sidewalk and grass came into my vision, I didn't ""see"" it. The only reason I didn't pop up on to the curb is because someone honked. If someone was on that sidewalk they would have just seen me looking forward and casually running them over. 

I've put it off because it only ever affected me, and I hate saying this, but my 'defect' could end up killing me or someone else. I apologize for the small wall of text, that may not seem necessary, but I want answer from people that have gone through the same stuff. I know a lot of people use it for other reasons, and that's totally fine. But I'm not interested in it for any other reason than it's purpose. And I hope there are a few people reading this that can help me with my question. **Does it help? What are your side effects, and are they worth it?**

And at first, my rolls were pretty powerful. I do what I'm supposed to, I normally space out my rolls 3 months or more, there's only been twice I rolled closer and it was in about a month's time in between. So it isn't as if I've been wearing down my tolerance. Same with L, I don't do it any more than M.

But for some reason, I find that my rolls, (candyflip or not, actually), have been weaker for a while now, at least in the past year. I expect it to be slightly weaker when mixed with L, but they've been considerably weaker for a while now. It's like I can't pass a certain point of euphoria anymore, like there's a cap. The M sometimes has a negative impact on the effects of L as well, kind of pulls me out of the clouds a bit; it sometimes takes me out of that peaceful psych state and I feel the disappointment/anxiety of coming down on the M. Visuals less intense sometimes. My normal dose is .25g, and I've been losing weight but I am currently at 165 lbs. I surprisingly had stronger flips when I was even 50 lbs heavier than this.

Some things to consider:

* I've been on keto for 2 years now as well, not sure if that would have any effect on it?
* I seem to have more intense flips when I don't take care of myself lmao. By that, not drinking enough water or food like 8 hours earlier within the day. If I eat/drink nothing, leading to puking, I have more intense rolls. I..definitely don't want to do that just to chase a stronger flip lol.
* My normal dosage of L is 1.5 tabs because I don't get many visuals with 1 lately, but maybe that's just too much for a flip?
* I normally take the L anywhere between 1 hr to 3 before the roll. Seems to be better when spaced out, or else the L overpowers when they're both peaking.
* I don't take any vitamins or anything leading up. Sometimes I take 5htp the days after.

I would love to flip without feeling disappointed by my rolls, because for me, M by itself may be slightly more intense but also leads to pure exhaustion. Scared I might have lost that feeling, which sucks because I know other people who have used much more frequently and still feel the same. Any help would be appreciated.

At that time I wanted to go deeper.

Shortly after those experiences I was going abroad for an internship with a developmental program in Africa and I took this seminar on tropical disease. A basic class on what can be dangerous and how to avoid it. This took place in a university lecture hall on the pharmacy campus. It said in big letters on the wall:

**Sola dosis facit venenum*****.*** *- Only the dose makes the poison.*

I've applied this to my  drug taking ever since, but never seen this saying on here. Water can be poisonous if you take too much. Fentanyl can be perfectly safe if you take the right amount. If you take that maxim to be the ground rule of drug-taking the following information should be known:

1. **What are you taking?** If it's LSD, are you 100% sure if it's LSD and not AL-LAD, 1P-LSD or even an Nbome? (although those seem to be less frequent nowadays) I've always trusted my dealers/vendors and never tested. Which is quite dumb. Especially if you tend to buy larger batches. If you spend $200 on drugs, $10 is not too much for a test kit.
2. **How much can you take?** Erowid has [dosage guides](https://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/dose/dose.shtml) on most drugs. First time using a new substance? Start on the lower end of common dosage. If you're underwhelmed, don't double it. Work your way up in a responsible matter.  
Also, at first treat your substance like it's 100% pure. Doesn't matter if your plug always has shitty coke. If he says it's a new batch and it's strong, work your way up. Be safe.
3. **Know what you can combine safely**. [This guide](https://wiki.tripsit.me/images/3/3a/Combo_2.png) has not only kept me safe, but also inspired me to take certain combinations. Can't find this link in the heat of the moment? **Tripsit combination chart.** Google that and you'll find it.

I don't have a addictive personality and I'm generally an extremely happy and satisfied individual with life that I enjoy very much with no drugs for the most part with people I love and cherish.

I did LSD for the first time last weekend, we used 100ug. I had used several drugs before up to that point, with 2cb and mushrooms coming the closest in the sense of experience, but never took acid. Let's just say we had a great time overall. The visuals were neat and warm, nature never looked prettier and we laughed and talked a lot. It was a much more social experience than I had anticipated. 

One thing bothered me a little bit throughout the trip though. I became very aware of all my bodily functions. I felt very awkward *being* this sort of meatbag processing food and turning it to shit. Also I was very self-aware of any mucus coming out of my nose, or farts I was letting out. I sort of constantly felt disgusted by my own body making sounds and feeling it move and squirm. It was a little tiring. It wasn't until I had a good night sleep that that feeling finally, entirely went away. 

Also, for the first few days afterwards I felt that scratching an itch didn't really do much. As if the recipients in my skin had weakened. That disappeared after s while as well though.

Anyways long story short, I've had a love for these prescriptions called lyrica that I was prescribed 2 years ago. ( am prescribed to take 1 200mg pill a day. But every exactly 4-6 days I always take either 3 or 4 of them so like 600mgs-800mgs at once. It effects of me the samge strength everytime because of the fact I give some days in between doses. Either way, I also have in the past taken almost every drug, but these days i'm just sticking to weed and other prescriptions as a start. 

As most of us benzos and any opiod consumed after taking lyrica, really enhances and can intensify the effects, sometimes by too much. But, besides the fact i've had mucn more experiences to pure mdma on lyrica, than a lot of street pills that suck where I live. So sometimes, not often, since I am not physically dependent on any of my pills, but do like to be careful. I love to take mix 3 1mg xanax's and 5 60mg codeine with 1500 apap total with 700mg lyrica counsumed an hour or two prior. I used to be prescribed somas so i'd be nodding in and out of consciousness.

My point is where for example, I took 8:00pm 7 lyricas 100:00pm 60mg codeine (tylenol 4s) 5 0f them 300mg total, and than 3mg xanax. Oh than tons of weed, which sometimes can better or worse. Either way, i could tell my friends or many others would be nodding, but i have a small tolerance to these substances luckily haven't taken any of them more than a few times a week for a years now. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to get high on only 300mg of codeine. So do you feel anything from taking 300mg's of codeine with lyrica. Or any experiences mixing opiods and lyrica?

me and my friend were at his house in the mountains for the weekend with my mom, his mom, and my sister, and we had already gotten caught with drugs once that weekend, but still decided to take dph.

we both take 800 mg and spend the first hour and a half just watching community and chilling, and i start to feel extremely heavy and moving at all is extremely uncomfortable. for some reason, i tell him that we have to go to bed, and he says okay.

i sleep for about an hour before i wake up randomly. i look over at my friend and see that he's still awake. hallucinations first started when i looked at the floor and saw the silhouette of a cat. i didn't think much of it and tried to fall asleep.

i open my eyes a couple of minutes later and i see standing at the foot of my bed facing the wall, my 8th grade science teacher reading a book. i stare at him for a while, but i try not to make it obvious, either because i was scared he would do something to me if he saw me, or that i didn't want to be rude. when i would stare at him for too long he would turn his head and look at me, being just as awkward as the average person would be. i point to my science teacher and tell my friend, but he says there's nothing there.

my friend constantly mutters to himself for the entire night, but i'm constantly telling him to be quiet, because i think that his mom is sleeping on the same couch that we are, and at the same time sitting on the stairs staring at us.

i need to use the bathroom pretty badly, so i get up and try to walk to the bathroom, but i end up walking upstairs. i go back downstairs and lay down again, not using the bathroom, but a few minutes later i remember that i have to use the bathroom. my second time trying to walk to the bathroom, i run face first into the wall at least 5 times. i try to turn the light on to see where i'm walking, but i touch the wall for the light switch, and it just feels like the wall. i can see the light switch on the wall, but it's almost like there's a picture of the light switch on the wall to trick me.

i try walking to the bathroom about 5 times, but blacking out and walking somewhere else every time. i eventually find the bathroom and use it, but when i come back to the couch i was sleeping on, i see a black floating figure in front of it. i didn't want to go anywhere near it so i walked around the best i could and played back down.

i look at the one room with a light on, and i see him. the hat man. a big shadow figure with a hat and a beak, almost like that of a plague doctor mask, staring straight at me.

i eventually fall asleep and sleep until about 9 the next morning. i'm making the bed i slept on the first night, and when i pick up my sheets to put on my bed, i see a small girl with a baby wrapped in a quilt. i stare at them for at least a minute before leaving the bedroom, utterly confused about who these people are. i walk back in, and they're gone. this is when i realize that i'm still high.

i see my friend laying on my bed, and i ask him what he's doing, but he just stares off into the distance. i leave the room to see my friend in the other room watching t.v.

By the third night we had had quite a heavy few nights of partying but decided at 3am in our drunken state to try source some ecstasy.

Unfortunately it was a sunday night and most clubs weren't open except for the club we had been the night before. But tonight it was a gay night, which as 4 straight lads didnt really interest us. So we nominated one of the lads to go in, buy some pills and then come back out so we could take them down by the beach.


We all pitched in for the entry fee and within 15 minutes our mate returns with the goods. On our way to the beach it began to rain (thankfully) so we decide to go to our room and take them. On the way home we bought a 12 pack of beer and took the pill completely ignoring the fact we had a flight in about 5 hours.

By the time we reached our room we had already started to come up, i had taken ecstasy many times before but this was a completely different sensation. 

The last thing I remember is it being 5am and the room was spinning then suddenly I wake up in Dublin  at 11am with no memory of even going through the airport.


I get off the plan and  One of my friends is a wheelchair user so I waited at the bottom of the stairs for him, while I was waiting the air hostess comes up to me and goes ""are you the guy from 5e?!"" I say yes.....she then explains that I fell asleep on another passenger and none of the air hostesses could wake me up and had to move said passenger to another seat.

I dont think I've ever been as embarrassed, I apologised and went on my way. 

The hour drive home consisted of all of us trying to remember bits of the night and wondering how we managed to get through airport security....with one of my friends remembering more than the rest, telling us all about what we did in my 6 hour memory gap.

I jokingly told my bf look out babe, there's a raid about to happen lol. Mind you we had weed, a bong, an ashtray and some other weed related items on the coffee table and weed is illegal in my country.
I hear a knock at the door, look thru the peephole and I see two figures, but it's a bit dark and I can't make out uniforms or anything. I open the door slightly and  now I see two officers. I internally freak out but try and maintain the best poker face I can muster. 
They say they got a call from someone about screaming and fighting in the apartment building and they're just asking residents if they heard anything. They ask to come in to which I told them, give me a second to get my bf to cover up and be more decent. They ask to keep the door ajar and I just clear everything and stash it away. They probably heard me open drawers or something but it was the best I could think of. I didn't say anything to my partner, he was still watching TV and didn't even flinch. I let them in and they're looking around everywhere they can without touching anything and say the same thing - someone reported screaming, they're just checking bla bla bla. I'm starting to lose my composure a bit and look a bit scared and shacking, but blame it on the fact that I'm worried someone's in trouble but that ultimately I heard nothing and bf confirms. 
There's no smoking allowed in my building so we use a draught stopper at the main door and keep the window open when we smoke and lucky for us, we didn't smoke about half hour before they came so it didn't smell.
They leave and I hear them say it's not them. It was the biggest relief I have ever felt in my life. I ripped some cones to calm myself down and celebrate not being arrested.

Money is tight so you decide you just want to buy a decent amount of the best overall opiate. 

The qualities that would define this are attributes like : length of peak effects or ""legs"" and very enjoyable euphoria(there is a difference between uplifting mental and physical euphoria and just plain anesthetic/sedation such as the effects I've read about from some of the fentalogues).

I'm open to trying any of them, as I'm very experienced with heavy duty morphine so I'd be interested in switching over to that if it's better. 
So ik there are tons of different opiates. Besides morphine which I use daily I have some experience with oxycodone which I'd consider better than morphine, and hydrocodone which is just alright but not as uplifting. I havent tried *most* of them. It seems like every heroin addict I've ever met couldn't stop talking about how much they love opana.

That being said, I like who I am when I  drunk, I am a lot more empathetic, I am kind, I am social, I love people for who they are. 

I do not consider myself an alcoholic, because I don’t drink often (mostly because I don’t want to blow money on drugs and drink all the time). But would it be bad if I really liked alcohol?

You have to understand where I am coming from though. 
I have literally CRIPPLING OCD (it’s genetic, it’s a family thing) I’ll literally spend hours just trying to get over a ritual, where I can’t do anything. 
And on top of that, I always feel like I am in a simulation, and I feel like I’m a psychopath because of this, and sometimes I become angry and look down on people because of this, but when I’m drunk, it’s like my mind slows down so that I can reflect and think on things, I’m not always thinking of myself, and my mind is off myself.

When I’m not drunk I get easily annoyed with people, and I get annoyed by even the littlest things, but when I’m drunk I actually listen to people and look at what they’re saying through an empathetic Lens and actually value them. 

Also I feel smarter and enjoy everything better lol. 

I never thought That I would enjoy alcohol this much, and benefit from it that much.

I am at the mall and just copped some Molly Acid Xans and Adderall, and decided why not take 2 of the tabs now, so they are on my tongue as I wait for the acid to dissolve, I was gonna hit My oil to calm the nerves and anxiety that comes with waiting and to just be a little up before I trip but as I’m writing this I’m still waiting for the most Ug I’ve ever take at once and am preparing mentally for the most intense trip I’ve ever had and holy shit am I ready. Last time I took acid I had an intense trip of self discovery, and am expecting a bit of the same thing time. Now the real question is do I take some of the molly tablets with it or do I fully wait till I’m near the last 4-5 hours of this trip to help extend it a bit


5:09 I am tripping balls, a loud lightning knocked out the internet so now I’m in my room tripping on what I promise you is 800ug cause omg I feel like everything and I’m just listening to Flatbush zombies and playing wit my brother he dead got me playing action figures, I feel this is the most intense trip of my life 
 5:13 I’m about to go and eat this trip is a crazy intesity having no service so I’m killing the trip a little bit with a Benzo I hate to do it but it’s hard again trust me this is 800 ugs
5:16 the fabrics of reality don’t seem real 
5:19 I killed it with a benzo and just waiting these 30-hour still no service 
5:35 me and Ricardo are on the phone and he’s my sober friend cause all I can do is call so he’s apparently gonna post this for me cause I can do a text message green
5:42 I found out the times I did all this from the phone call so I called him at 3:09  and the power went out at 4:25 which means I didn’t have no way to talk to anyone for an hour and this hour had been scary. I’m gonna try texting other people. This benzo better fucking work. I only can make calls and do sms text
6:06 I’m eating cake with mom and brother but ricarods phone just died so idk who to call and what would be a good person to be able to be otp with when I’m gone like this 
6:08 he his phone back on and work it feels like it’s been dead for 10 minutes but it had been I think it helped kill the trip or either that or I’m gonna past the first peak cause su have multiple peaks
6:16 he gonna call me back 
6:19 I go to another place and zone out and I find it hard to come back because I feel like I’m lost and have to play catch up on everything that happened to me 
I wow it’s 6:22 and don’t kenos what we’re talking about it Seem wow it’s 6:24 time is a joke at this point I keep escaping reality and coming back and having to keep interacting with my mom and this is hard omg how long had Ricardo been good two minutes feel like a hike 10 minute every moment feels like 6:27. I feel like I’m time traveling through every moment. Even with the benzo this is important 
I feel like I’m having whole conversations with people and realize it didn’t happen 
Each 2 minute interval feels like I’ve done at least 20 tasks 
I don’t remember how I got this whole experience has been crazy and now the benzo didn’t kill it my benzo killer idea, a benzo kills the high of a normal tab but with 800ug I’ve discovered it calms the trip and isn’t killing my trip but enchanting it in a different way, just making me slightly more forgetful but it feels like every 2 minutes is a whole eternity to the point where I have to keep reading this message every few minutes cause it feels like a long time towards another at this point it feels 6:39 omg every moment feels like eternity but ever since I popped the benzo now I feel like I just be moving scene by scene I don’t know how to describe it but basically with 800ugs like I can’t tell you the last 30 minutes I’m not tripping balls so much and as intense but I’m still tripping in a different way like as if the benzo is taking dominance and having my psychedelic vision I don’t know, I can’t keep track of this, whatever I’m right now I won’t remember in a minute this is incredible now I think this is the most grand view of ego death also I’m telling you I can’t remember what happened 5 minutes ago, tome movies so quick cause Of the acid and then the Xan just made me more forgetful, why am I no on the phone u don’t remember and how long has it been and what have I been doing bro taking the benzo I don’t remember bro see once something catches my attention I forget what just happened, the acid is still very much here, it’s felt like a whole new day has passed, I forgot why I’m not on the phone  I feel like says Aw passing me by I don’t know where I am like mentally wbu am I not on the phone bro I don’t know this is crazy the benzo fucked it up it helped with how intense the trip was but it kind of also killed the potential but ido bro I’m still kind of tripping balls I can’t explain it it’s like every new room I enter is like a new world, still no one to tak to why am I not otp?
6:48 I don’t remember single thing all day which is, no internet, write here, Ricardo has a phone inane he’s who’s helping me through this 
6:59 we are on the phone and I don’t remember the last hour but I think the benzo killed my trip and took over and now I’m so forgetful I think it’s a lil the do both like the acid taking me out of my body and The benzo makes me forget what happens in the moments so the acid tries to figure it out everything feels fake I shouldn’t have taken the benzo because now I think my whole trip it’s gonna be this which is just forgetting and reappearing( I might take the last tab and see what happens or the molly 
I feel like I can have a conversation and In between two sentences time has passed and I forget but no time DIDNT I was just thinking of the future tense I’m thinking of taking another tab to fix the trap but it’s only 4 hours in the trip and time has moved in ways that feel days honestly I feel like days have passed, I want to drop the other tab to fix it if I take the other tab it would blessed because of the benzo 
I feel like I don’t remember a single thing that hapoened the last 10 minutes how many I don’t remember anything since like 5 me and Ricardo on the phone again trying to decipher this, never doing 800 ug with a hulk again but maybe another tab rn would bless Im thinking of taking another tab 7:48 I might take the other tab I wish I could get rid of the benzo 
8:38 if I take the tab while o start tripping again and I think it was the circumstances that stopped me from being able to last the 800ug but if I take the acid while it work

I have had some surgeries in the last few years due to some health issues (I am fine now!), so it was prescribed to me. Even while recovering from major surgeries, I didn’t take the oxy often. I found that coming off it gave me terrible headaches and that I could usually manage my pain with Tylenol. Because of this, I had an almost full bottle; about 28 pills.

Bored and craving a different state of mind, I popped one before watching a movie. As it started coming on, I felt so much appreciation for every aspect of the film: the acting, the characters, the plot, etc. this quickly became my preferred way to watch movies. At first I was spacing my doses out every few days, but one week I took one or two every night. I believe it took me about three weeks to finish the bottle. 

When I eventually ran out, I was relieved. I have always prided myself in my ability to experiment with drugs without developing dependency, but I could tell I was on the cusp this time. A day or two after I finished the bottle, I quite desperately rummaged through my medicine drawer for another. I found a mostly empty bottle of 5 mg oxycodone-acetaminophen. I popped two over the course of the evening while watching a movie. It relieved me that night, but the next morning I was hungover, jumpy, and agitated. I felt total despair for my own life and the fate of the world. This feeling persisted for a week or so. I was unable to say much to my family at dinner or when seeing friends. (I did not go out in public.) I knew these feelings had come out of my oxy use. When it started to subside, I had no problem staying away from the few remaining pills. 

After a pretty good day, I was inspired by [Bryan Lewis Saunders](http://bryanlewissaunders.org/drugs/) and decided to paint while high. It was truly wonderful. My art was uninhibited by my usual insecurities and I could paint without an audience in mind, just for pure experimentation and pleasure. I ended up very proud of the result. I still am. It made me so sad to know that I could be painting like this all the time, without the oxy. I was restless that night. The next morning, I flushed the remaining pills. 

To me, the most appealing thing about this was how comfortable it made me feel. I have never felt so at peace with myself or my abilities. The contrast between the high experience and the sober experience became stark. My takeaway is that oxycodone showed me a state that I would like to achieve, especially with my art. Five days after my last dose, I’ve been trying to let go.

LSD, mushrooms, kratom, phenibut, gabapentin, whatever (some test for kratom/gabas so be careful..) 

I started daily dosing kratom, take about 15GPD, then came the semi consistent LSD/Mushroom use during quarantine, I took LSD about 6-7 times and mushrooms like 15 times (I grow them.) I was using nitrous oxide sometimes in conjunction as well, and occasionally DMT. I had a serious panic attack 8 hours into an LSD experience, I was almost sober, or atleast felt close, I think it was just my lack of sleep due to psychedelics and whatever. I havnt taken psychedelics in about 5 weeks now. 

I started having symptoms of a panic attack, was told lack of sleep plays a roll here. I finally had a full blown one yesterday, thought I was going to have a seizure. Drove to the hospital (dont advise this,) but didnt want to get checked in due to how expensive it is, so I walked back to the parking lot just to feel safer. Stayed for like 20 minutes, thought I was good and drove away, came right back because it was happening again.. stayed like 15 minutes and went home. They werent going to let me in bc my temp was 101 anyways (COVID,) I was like duh Im having a breakdown and I get temp checked everyday at work but ok. 

Phenibut should not be abused. I used to use heroin, got on methadone for a few years, got off. It was awful to get off, but this phenibut really messes with me mentally. Sometimes I feel like I need to take my phenibut dose so Ill take it, and feel even worse for awhile. My normal dose is aroumd 1.2G now. 

I feel like dealing with trying to fight off panic attacks is oddly similar to trying to combat a difficult trip. I now realize how important a good nights sleep is. I have a lot of interesting stories, but I just want to show that some people just are not meant to be using psychedelics very heavily. Im a normal dude, no mental issues but my abuse has trained my mind into giving myself anxiety/panic attacks. If anyone has these and would like to chat, im all ears.

I'm leaving to Netherlands in 2 days, and I need to smuggle just a little amount of meth through Vienna airport security. I read a thousands of articles, about how Europe banned those super-boddy scanners, and they are using only Millimeter wave scanner. 

I smuggled little amount of meth one year ago, also to Netherlands, but I was travelling from Bratislava airport ( Slovakia ) and the security there is really terrible. They only have those metal detectors, that's everything. I smuggled it in my vagina, inside the tampon. But now I'm kinda scared, if Vienna hasn't got better X-Rays, ad I've seen in Eindhoven, like those full body scanners - I don't know what are they able to see, if they see just under my clothes or they will see inside my tampon. 

I'm 99% sure that smuggling drugs to plane is safest inside you, but now i'm little curious, because on Vienna airport website they don't specify the type of x-ray they have. If I'm getting it right, if they have any transmission x-rays ( i thought they are banned in EU )

Is there anyone who flew from Swechat in past time? 

please just keep comments like "" just don't do it "" for yourself. Maybe I'm too paranoid, because last year it was like nothing, but it was in Bratislava.

&amp;#x200B;

I have used a variety of stimulants in the past few years, MDMA, Mkat, Cocaine, Speed and meth, are the ones i can think of currently.

They all seemed to work as they normally should when i first start using them.

But eventually they seem to become less and less like they originally was. I know its not gonna be the exact same as the first time obviously, but this is a drastic change, best example is with MDMA.

&amp;#x200B;

When i first took MDMA it was very euphoric, loving everyone and everything as most people do on this substance. I was like this for a while, but then i started to notice I would get longer and more intense come ups than usual. They would then begin to last hours sometimes before i would even be up. Then eventually it would be usually a 3-4 hour come up and will drop off into me just being sober. I didnt do MDMA unhealthily frequent, and I did not take massive doses, was mainly 1-2 200mg pingers per sesh. After first usage was maybe once a month for a few months. Then after was a lot more space in between usage. But I havent done MDMA properly in over a year now because it just does not work on me anymore. Hence me doing harder drugs so I can be rolling with my mates when theyre using MDMA. With Mkat being the one I would use when they used MDMA as its the most similar drug I have found. But im starting to see the same thing happen with Mkat as it did with MDMA for me. I dont use Mkat frequently at all, only when were seshing in someones house which isnt very often.

&amp;#x200B;

It has started to happen with cocaine and other stimulants as well, I just dont feel as social and stimulated as i once did with these drugs, which is sad. Most mates put it down to not having a big break from stimulants. But before i tried MDMA last year, I had a year break from it, thinking this would work I tried it again, and once again nothing happened but a 4 hour comeup into sober ness.

&amp;#x200B;

So ye just wondering if anyone else experiences this and why it happens to me, whereas it doesnt happen to any of my friend despite doing stimulants the same frequency as eachother.

&amp;#x200B;

If you think I have left out any information that would help, drop a reply and I will get back to you.

&amp;#x200B;

I fell asleep very quickly and only experienced mild grogginess the next morning. I looked up what drug acted as the sleep aid and read that it is non-habit forming and even safe for pregnant women to take so I figured there wasn't any harm in taking NyQuil nightly to help sleep. I have always only taken one full (30mL) dosage of NyQuil per day and do not take any acetaminophen or consume alcohol. In 2015 I became pregnant with my twin daughters and had to stop taking NyQuil since it contained small amounts of alcohol. I had developed a psychological dependency on NyQuil since stopping it was very difficult but I had no issue discontinuing Ritalin and Xanax under the supervision of my psychiatrist. My difficulty falling asleep continued and my OBGYN told me it was safe for me to take doxylamine succinate on it's own as a sleep aid so I switched to taking it in tablet form. About 6 months ago I told my psychiatrist about my need to take anti-histamines to fall asleep and she told me that studies have found that long term use of antihistamines increases likeliness of dementia and that I should stop taking them ASAP. She's prescribed me two different sleep aids but they give me such awful side effects that I've not been able to stick to them for more than a couple weeks and end up taking doxylamine succinate to fall asleep. I've been trying to find out the risk of taking doxylamine succinate compared to other anti-histamines but I've not been able to find anything.

It’s cool I don’t care as long as they don’t have fent in them. I bought test strips from dance safe and this is the method I used to test:

Filled a cup of water. Dropped the Xanax inside. Waited until it was mostly dissolved (alp isn’t water soluble which shouldn’t matter) however I did notice a little bit of fine residue in there that didn’t seem to dissolve in the water. I figured it was some sort of filler agent because if it was alp it woulda been way too much in a single bar.  I stirred it around for a while and then I stuck my test strip in there and stirred it around and let it soak up the water for a few min. After about 10 min of drying 2 lines came up which indicates no fent was detected. I figured I was good to go. Swigged the water and it felt like good ole Xanax, I have some experience with opiates and didn’t have any of those effects. I know Xanax well and it felt exactly right.

The weird thing is these bars don’t taste bad. I can pretty much chew them up and I don’t have that lingering alp taste that you get when you eat a pharmacy bar. Didn’t think too much of it cuz they def seemed on the up and up to me. I also heard fent bars can smell like cat piss which these also have no smell at all. 

I just recently heard from someone else that a couple people are talking and claiming the bars def have fent in them (kids in questions are complete idiots and they’re opinions mean absolutely nothing to me but i just want to ensure my safety).. I’ve taken a couple at a time and even mixed with like a beer or two so I feel like if there was any fent in it that I would have been dead by now. Over the last few months I have probably taken over 100 of them which may seem like a lot to some but I have severe anxiety disorder which I used to have the prescribed. (I know I should just go get another script I’ve just moved to a new state and have to find another psychiatrist and the process can be rather annoying) 

The guy selling is supposed to be a pretty straight shooter and doesn’t seem like the type that would fuck with that shit at all but you never know.

I have some more test strips, I was wondering if there is a more effective method at testing the pill for fent than what I did. I just wanna be safe. The directions don’t give any insight into what to do with pills, just powders. 

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. Not looking for judgement or lectures here, I’m trying to practice harm reduction and that’s it.

So I figured fuck it, I’ll drop 1200 since I took 600 a week ago and have some tolerance.

So my girlfriend picked me up, and we went back to her house. As soon as we arrived, we saw extra cars in the driveway. Family friends had come over and the acid was coming up soon, so I did not have time to chat lmao.

We snuck upstairs and she went down to say hi. After she left, I could already feel the acid coming up hard. Lots of nervous energy, uncontrollably smiling, letters on my phone were boogieing and general brightness.

As more and more time passer by alone, the energy and visuals just kept kept more intense, and I started to get delusional thoughts about my girlfriend not coming back and how she had somehow died (these weren’t too concerning for me as I sometimes get these thoughts sober and am used to dealing with them) and I kept hearing cars pulling up and leaving (idk if this was real or if I only happened once and I time looped it happening like four times Idk) 

After like an hour I was getting really worried, but I hadn’t checked my phone in a while so I saw my gf texted “sorry I’m taking so long” or sum like half an hour ago. So then we texting and I’m more chill cuz I’m talking to her but it’s still like 15-30 more minutes before she came up.

It had felt like an eternity since I’d seen her and I was tripping very hard at this point. I have a very hard time describing visuals so it’s not gonna sound nearly as intense as it was. Shadows were dancing on the walls and patterns emerged on all surfaces. I saw complex spinning geometric colors with the most beautiful colors. I got brief “flashes” where visuals got dark and fucky in an indescribable way (not unpleasant). My gfs tapestry was moving in the most beautiful way and I kept staring at her face because it was the most beautiful thing I’d seen.

There were many more visuals than these but it is hard to remember some parts of the trip and very hard to describe some visuals on high doses as the way you feel is greatly connected with what you see.

I think I was starting to peak at this point (I knew I was really high because my gf said my pupils were saucers and they normally don’t get that much bigger). I guess my gf was kinda horny at this point cuz she touched my dick and things started happening and we had sex. I could barely coordinate my body at this point, so it was a little difficult at first lmao.

I’m not gonna go into too much detail because this isn’t r/tifu but I don’t remember most of it as I was losing consciousness/reality. I can’t say I experienced ego death, but If I ever came closest this was the time. It felt like our bodies were interconnected and becoming one. Was really hot ngl lol. But I kinda came back to consciousness at some point during/after and was kinda confused lol asking what day it is where I am. Kinda lost reality there for a bit. My gf said it lasted like 45 min (yes that’s normal for us I have josh potter syndrome and can’t cum lol blessing and a curse) and I remember prob less than half of that

After we had sex, I think I was coming towards the end of the peak. We just cuddled For like and hour while I stared at the walls lol. At this point it was like 11:30 and she had work the next day so we had to bring me home. I realized I hadn’t eaten anything at all today so we decided to go to the gas station before she dropped me off.

When we left we saw baby raccoons next to her driveway. So cute. Then it felt like a spaceship in her car and I was seeing lasers and stars and shit it was so cool.

Like so many others in the UK I have struggled to find a dealer/seller of psychedelics. I have done LSD more times than I can count and have 10 tabs in my stash. But I was intrigued by mushrooms/psilocybin and the difference in the experience between this compound and LSD. So I wanted to try mushrooms but could not safely identify them myself, nor did I know anyone who sold them. So I was left with one option... The internet. I knew from other UK psychonauts that psychedelic truffles are easily obtainable from websites based in Holland/Amsterdam. They rarely/never get stopped at customs and are quite reliable to buy and receive. They are the closest thing I can get to mushrooms at this moment so I went for it. 

After literally googling 'magic truffles' I was given a whole load of websites to choose from that all shipped to the UK from Amsterdam. So I ordered some magic truffles from one of these vendors. They arrived after about a week. 
In this package was air tight heat sealed packets of fresh truffles. I ordered 15 grams each of what their websites said were the top three strongest varieties were. 

So I now have/had:
15g of Atlantis. 15g of utopia (a slightly genetically modified version of Atlantis that is able to grow for far longer and produce a bit more psilocybin) and 15g of Hollandia (reportedly the strongest truffle type currently available in Amsterdam). 

The reviews for all of these truffles were extremely mixed with some people saying they (for example) took the whole packet of Hollandia and were very underwelmed by the experience and barely felt anything. While other reviews were very positive of the truffles, stating to treat them with respect and they had very intense psychedelic experiences with them. So I didn't really know the real strength of these truffles unless/untill I tried some.

So yesterday evening I (visually, as I don't own scales) split the packet of Atlantis into two little piles of truffles. So let's assume I took somewhere between 6 and 8 grams of Atlantis. Atlantis is reportedly the weakest out of the three varieties I had.

To prepare them I simply sliced the little nut like truffles into tiny pieces with a sharp knife (to maximize surface area), put that into a mug and poured in some lemon juice to cover them. I left the little pieces to soak for around 10 minutes. This apparently makes the trip come on quicker as your body has to do less work converting the psilocybin into psilocin (or whatever it's called) because the lemon juice interacts with the fungi and converts alot of it. I then put in around 100ml of hot (not boiling) water into the mug and stirred it around. I drank the sharp tangy mixture down and then chewed on the truffles that were left on the bottom. They tasted like walnuts but a bit more bitter. They might have been perceived as sour had they not been mixed with lemon juice. A lot of people report truffles taste horribly sour and putrid but I had no trouble eating them. The mix was kind of like a lemony walnut tasting concoction. It was almost a pleasure to drink/eat them. This was at 7.20pm

Then in preparation I googled 'best movies to watch on mushrooms' and the 2010 Alice in Wonderland movie seemed to be highly recommend. I had never seen it before so I thought fuck it and rented it off Amazon prime for 2 or 3 quid.

When I started to notice the first effects I pressed play. This was around 20 or 30 minutes after ingestion.
A familiar visual phenomenon began to occur in which textures seemed far more emphasized and everything seemed to have a magical glow to it. My pattern recognition was also ramped up by not as much as when on LSD. The faint rippled glow shining through my curtains onto the wall behind the TV seemed to be holographic in nature in the sense that the light was floating in front of the surface. It's hard to explain. But anyways, I was definitely at the start of what was destined to be a magical trip. 

The movie choice was actually excellent. Very appropriate for coming up on mushrooms as the film becomes more and more mind bending and bizarre as the story progresses. Each scene's theme or mood seemed to be very amplified for me and I felt very connected to Alice and her bewildering experiences. By the time the mad hatter (Jonnie Depp) was introduced I was definitely beginning to trip more intensely. His face and make up seemed way over the top and had a glassy/shadowy/trippy vibe to it but this was very amplified by the truffles. 

I felt very involved and invested in the story. Almost like I was absorbed entirely into the movie and was experiencing all of Alice's emotions. I suppose in a way, I too had fallen down the rabbit hole with her and was there along side her. 
The final battle in the movie was fuckin awesome to be honest but I know that if I had tried to watch the movie sober I would have found it too bizarre and outlandish and probably wouldn't have watched it to the end. 

Now that the movie had finished I was brought back into the room. I sat in silence and observed. I realized that I had become lazy/complacent/stuck with my current state of being and my living room was a mess. I recognized this was due to me spending pretty much all of my time either working or getting high. I had let my standards slip and my place was a mess. I had a walk around the flat and saw the same signs everywhere. I had lost my way without even noticing it. But the psilocybin gently and with compassion showed me where I was going wrong in life and that it would not be hard for me to tidy my place up when I get the time and sort my life out. 

It felt like the mushroom/truffles had a spiritual presence to them which I have not felt on LSD. As if the mushroom is  a guide/teacher that has lived an infinite amount of lives and has already lived yours. As if it has a wisdom or intelligence to it that is external from the human body. So it gently but firmly held the mirror of reality up to my face and made me aware of my flaws. I took them onboard and today began sorting my life out. So the trip was an incredibly insightful experience and more spiritual/therapeutic than my LSD trips. LSD to me is very much about the warping and twisting of perception and seeing unbelievable things. But I feel very different about psilocybin now that I have tried it. 

The trip began to leave me at exactly 4 hours after ingestion. This may have been because i sped up the trip by using the lemon juice trick. But either way,  it was a great 4 hours. I am thankful that I now have 5 (hopefully) equally as potent trips waiting for me in my fridge and I look forward to pushing the boundaries a bit more next time. maybe I'll take the rest of the Atlantis and a third of the utopia packet to have a more intense trip. 

Now having met mushrooms/psilocybin/truffles I recognize their potential as teachers and their healing qualities. It's like nature or an old timeless all knowing spirit had opened my eyes again to realty and shown me that my current life had become somewhat stale and stagnant. It was exactly what I needed :).

I do not condone or encourage the use of any illegal substance. I do however recommend mentally stable, responsible adults to try psychedelics if you feel brave enough. We have alot to learn from them :)

Ever since my teenage years I always enjoyed taking an upper or downer while flying to entertain myself and deal with the hours of boredom in a slightly limited torture position known as the in flight 
airplane economy seat. Dextroamphetamine or hydrocodone was my drug of choice. Sometimes being lucky enough to enjoy both on a flight.

Well in college I discovered  one could get benzos easily for the specific  purpose of flying due to flight anxiety.

And when I found out my girlfriend had signed up to study abroad in London England. I quickly capitalized on getting an easy script for Xanax.

DO NOT TAKE A BUNCH OF MILLIGRAMS OF ALPRQZOLAM IF YOU HAVE TO FLY INTERNATIONAL ON MORE THAN ONE FLIGHT.

One of the most miserable waking up experiences of my life was due to an ugly psychopathic female flight attendant pinching me alert to hurry up and get off the plane because I am the last one still on the plane and I am holding up the next flight from boarding.

I had to run to my connecting gate because I was extra late. I was only 19 and very naieve about being prepared with travelling abroad comfortably.

I did manage to smuggle codeine, more Xanax, ketamine, amphetamine, and 2c-e for me and my girls enjoyment to take at global gatherings in Stratford upon Avon at a proper Massif rave!

gotta love tripping in the land of Shakespeare.

This was pre body scan x-ray machines. So it was super easy to crotch mAh goodies

Was wondering what this community has to say about the topic. Both substances have lots of information written about them in terms of medical usage, but not so much solid info is available on recreational usage. Medically, kratom is used for pain and kava is used for anxiety. Recreationally, kava is served at special bars but I have never been to one and only heard stories with varying opinions. Kratom does not seem to have much of a culture around recreational usage but I have to believe lots of people are using it this way even if they say they are not.

Ideally I am looking for something to replace alcohol about 75% of the times that I drink (currently 1x per week) looking to cut back to only drinking about once a month and using either (or both) substances on the other 3 nights when I would generally be drinking. I really like the effect of alcohol but it is hurting my progress in the gym, ruins any motivation I have for the next day and just generally makes me feel shitty after. Obviously I could just cut back and have like 3 drinks instead of 6-8 but who really wants to do that now!

So drugs, in your opinion which of these substances is more recreational and which would work better as an alcohol replacement.

I'm honestly not to worried about dependency (I know those are classic last words lol) because I tend to have good self control and would only be using either substance about once a week with a break every month when I drink instead but I'll listen to any concerns people have.

Mdma- gets me good in the mood but it varies by what the conversation consists of (main aspect is that the effect of mdma reminds me on certain points, even unrelated, that sex is an option), body feeling related to sex 65%, need something like cialis to bypass the bonerkiller effect of it 7.5/10

Lsd- doesn't get me in the horny by itself but if my mind passes by the realm it gets me pretty buttery feeling on doing it, nice body sensations somewhat 42%, don't have moments of reminding, i have to consciously go that way 5.8/10

Weed- consciously know it would feel good to do it but doesn't improve my libido on it, maybe just a tiny bit 2.6/10

That's all i tried for now, am planning to get some speed which i heard is like the master of the aspect, coke, 2cb, ketamine and dmt

Weed is a pretty cheap drug. $20 can get you high more than once. However, regular use can you run you around $50-100 a week. That can take a toll on your quality of life if you work a lower paying job. When I was younger and used to work fast food I would find myself weighing out weed into several different baggies to last until payday. I realized this was dumb and I would never get anywhere in life if I was constantly getting high so I decided to stop until I had money to play with. 3 ish years later I got a good job and started smoking again. Smoking weed is much better when you aren’t worried about running out or you aren’t wasting your life and money.

I am trying to process this trip so I will write it out in hopes that someone with more experience can comment further.. 

I have taken mushrooms a little over 10 times.
70% of those were all during concerts (1-3g in chocolates) 
The other 30% were all small doses under 2g and I just had a great body high and mellow mood. 

And then I had the strongest trip of my life which has brought me here. 

Short version: 
A couple of nights ago I took 2.6 g penis envy with lemon tek tea. Took 7-10 minutes to start feeling it. Very different from the usual hour it takes to start feeling it. The first hour was pretty intense but felt pretty much like any  other trips. 

Throughout the next hour It intensified and I realized I was TRIPPING BALLS. My sister and I (she was sober) were watching The Midnight Gospel for the first hour and a half. I think that I didn’t realize I was tripping so hard because I was watching a cartoon, so when my sister switched the. Tv to The Office, I was able to grasp how gone I was. 

I have never had open eye visuals/hallucinations like this before. I have had the usual breathing effect and bright colors, but this time I was seeing things that were not reality. It was like every single persons face was in a constant Snapchat filter, all the same one, making their eyes huge, googly, and cartoon like. I was watching the office and every character was the same, weird big eyed faces with smaller face features. (Hard to explain other than a Snapchat filter) 

Also during this, time slowed down drastically. I was able to think 100 things while the tv was going, like I could hear the characters speak but I was able to think inbetween all of it. I found this cool and felt like I was living “in the moment”. 

I sat there for about an hour just thinking about what I was seeing and realizing how weird it was. I have read a lot about shrooms but I have never heard of seeing things like this so I was weirded out. I know LSD and high doses of shrooms can make you trip like this but I wasn’t expecting it on 2.6g. 

After the first 2 hours it started to go down hill because I just wanted it to be over. I couldn’t open my eyes without everything being “different” than it should be. I kept reminding myself I took mushrooms and was sort of able to calm down but i kept having repeating thoughts and just wanted it to be over already. 

The rest of the trip is sort of a blur, but i was having some weird thoughts about being the only person on earth, like everyone else is just my imaginary, everything being fake, being like this forever, etc. not so fun.  

Is this all normal? Did I just not let myself relax and enjoy it because I was taken back from the OEV? Or Am I just dumb for not realizing that my reality could drastically alter from 2.6g penis envy? 



Longer version/more details:

I hadn’t taken a higher dose of  shrooms in about 4 years until this year. And even then my highest dose was prob only a couple of g’s at a music festival. 

After my dog/best friend passed away this year I stumbled into mushroom hunting as I wanted a hobby to keep up my long hikes we used to do together. In a way; I I feel as if the mushrooms found me after his passing and I have been thankful for them. 

Anyways, 
I have been pretty successful in my hunting now and it’s been a fun hobby however I have been only taking small doses of them since finding them. .8, 1g etc
Until last night... 

Before I had been successful finding them in the wild I had asked my sister if she knew where to find any and after a couple of weeks she was  able to get her hands on an 8th of Penis Envy for me. I knew PE is known to be stronger, but I didn’t know what to expect. 

3 nights prior to this trip, I had eaten 1g of wild cubes, with a disappointing trip as it was super mild,, had a slight body high and it dissipated after 2 or so hours, so I wanted to try again  to get a stronger trip. I knew 3 days wasn’t much time to wait, so the 2.6 g in my mind wasn’t going to be that strong. Well I was wrong. 

For some time I thought I was for sure going to stay like this forever, I was gonna be a mental patient because I had taken some shrooms and would never come back to normal, I told myself that this is what alll people who trip start to think and I need to relax. But when it’s happening you really believe it. 

I had some weird moments at the end while listening to “here comes the sun” it felt like I was in a nursing home and 90 and had dementia and was just about to wake up from a weird dream. 


I would deff say I prob had my first “ bad trip” but I am still trying to sort it out. 

I think it comes down to me not expecting to see what I saw, and that’s what made me uncomfortable. 


I just want to know that other people see things like I did on that night when they take shrooms?

Grapefruit and some bitter orange juices contain  [Naringin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naringin) (and its metabolites) , Bergamottin, 6/7Dihydroxybergamottin and or [furanocoumarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furanocoumarin).

Those substances are inhibitors for some of the P450 family Enzymes.

The most popular among those is CYP3A4 which is important for many Drugs.  I could find solid sources that claim it also works for CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 which also play a role in quite a few substances metabolism. In fact these three cover heaps of opioids and benzos.

The CYP3A4 Inhibition is the most pronounced one according anecdotes.

White and Red Grapefruit juices with bitter tastes are generally considered to be the most ""potent"" whilst others are rather lacking. Freshly pressed is best, pressed bought is ok too, Concentrate is mediocre.

Yes I know socially anxious people are more prone to becoming alcoholics, but it just feels so good to be around people in harmony. Something I didn't have all my life. I never got aggressive or pissed on alcohol. Moreover I don't feel like drinking on any other occasion than hanging out with a bunch of people, i.e. I don't want to drink alone or in the week.

I only risked it because I knew it also helps a lot with my withdrawals.

I know I'm an idiot. Basically I go into the ward bathroom and sneakily roll a tiny joint, put it in my pocket, get out a normal cigarette, and say im going for my fag breaks, then go offsite, smoke the J, spray some deodorant, wait a while, then go back in.

If I do smell of it, then my excuse will be (which is true) that I used to store it in my laptop bag, which reeks of it, and they can search that all they want. They can't legally search me only my belongings.

The title says it all. Whenever im tripping on deliriants or psychedelics and even sometimes in the dark with stimulants/weed i'll be confusing an object for a cat just for a slight second then my terrified-ass jumps literally to the ceiling because i don't have any cats. Sometimes i'll just see one randomly waking around, hell sometimes i confused one of my friend's arms and legs for a cat.

It becomes quite absurd because we'll be having a very serious conversation or going in-depth about a topic and one of us suddenly jumps from the couch and just yells "" WHOAAAAAA "" and all of us will be like what the hell while the victim of the cats is unable to express his reasoning for their sudden shock and eventually they're like ""IT'S THE CATS AGAIN!""

I managed to reach some insane level of closed eye visuals, like a visual representation of every song we were playing everytime I was closing my eyes.

It could range from 3D isometric video game where I could see a civilization evolving from beginning to end that morph into different video game interface really fast and going through a lot of other thematic such as pure landscapes, movies, futuristic scenes and beginning of time, or me exploring different part of the world like being under a frozen lake or inside an erupting volcano. It looked like I was able to also have a certain control on the visuals as I was able to image and represent complex and out of this world dimensions, it was all making sense and it really felt like I was contemplating an actual world living.  
Funny part of all this is that I was barely having any open eye visuals, but everytime I was closing my eyes it was a firework of hallucinations.

so, a little bit of background first. she was prescribed a ssri when she was 13 for some retarded shit even though she def didn't need it, but I guess that's the farmaceutical and medical system for you. afterwards her dopamine levels got fucked up so she stared doing drugs since she was 14 started with weed dxm did ket, tantum rosa, cocaine and lots of fucking mdma ( i mean like 4 or 5 blue punishers every month). keep in mind all of this was happening while she was still 14. anyway fast forward a year and couple of months later we met.

back then, I fucking loved drugs. been doing them since I was 14 or something, i fucking love opioids and bezos, and frankly speaking i just wanted to get fucked up and have fun. however, after meeting her my perception changed drastically. she was placed in rehab like 2 or 3 months after we met and that's when I realised this whole thing s fucked up. me and my friends, we had lotta self control when doing shit. we d quit benzos and opioids cold turkey in order to be clean for a sports championship that would be a couple of months later, and we could abstain from anything for a long period of time, so i saw drugs like something harmless really. but then, with her, she couldn't resist them. at the hospital they said she has some hormonal and dopamine irregularities, so that's where her addiction to being high comes from. that was happening in december. after she got out, we had a long talk and decided that she wouldnt do anything from now on except her treatment (zoloft and some other ssri).

everything felt amazing for a couple of months. she was clean, i was clean too cuz i didn't feel the need to do anything since i had her. best time of my life, especially because she was getting better and it looked like she had overcome that issue.

then corona came and with it the quarantine. and it all went to hell. got back to her drug habit. i tried to talk to her, and that's when she broke up with me - she didn't want me to stop her from doing drugs.

right now she is on some 4 or 5 pills ( ssri, and some schizofrenia medication). she does a fuckload of shit, 25i, cocaine, speed daily, benzos, synthetic cannabinoids.

i dont know what to do honestly, and i thought to ask here. i just don't want her to die or fuck up her life for good with some irreversible brain damage, but it seems like nothing helps.

sorry for the formatting and eventual errors, english is not my native language.

feel free to ask any questions. i'm sure I'm not entirely coherent. I'm not the best storyteller, and I tried to summarise all that i had to say in some ideas.

Shitty brick weed/or low quality mids with seeds were all we could get, but I would get super stoned. I started skipping school to go play Halo and get high with friends. Eventually I got expelled, had to go to the alternative school, then dropped out and got my GED. I then went to college for a few semesters, but ultimately dropped out because I would skip classes because I would go get high. I have never gone more then maybe 48 hours without getting high because I was always around friends who would share, and my entire family are heavy smokers. 

I probably smoked a gram a day, which turned into 2, then 3. It was only 5/g but then I discovered good weed for the first time at about age 16 and it changed everything. I went from smoking 3ish grams of mids a day to a gram of 20/g top shelf. At around age 17, I got desperate and started selling my stuff to pawn shops buy weed. I felt really bad, so I decided to get a job and pay for my habit. 

Age 18, I probably was smoking upwards of 2g/day and spent 50% of my income on weed. From 2012-2018, I pretty much had top shelf weed consistently and its all I did. Sometime in mid 2019, the quality of bud in my area declined substantially and up and until now, I have had fire weed maybe 2 dozen times in the past year. I keep on spending money on shitty weed and I am going nowhere in my life. I have finally got to the point where I am fed up with the weed and I am mad at myself for staying in this cycle for so long. I really ruined opportunities and wasted so much money because I was content just staying home and getting high. I didnt want to travel unless I had weed, I didnt hangout with people who didnt get high. Had to get high before work, etc.

With all this time off with the pand and nothing to do, I have been spending almost a ***grand*** a month on weed. The weed doesnt get me high because its weak plus a decade of daily smoking means it takes close a gram to get barely high for 15 minutes. I just smoke for no reason at this point. I am ready to be free of this. Its one thing to smoke 50-100 a week if you really enjoy getting high and it improves the quality of your life, which it did for years, but when you spend hundreds a week and you dont get anything out of it, you just realize its no longer a positive to your life and its just a giant money pit. I havent been truly high in about a month despite smoking all the time.

Weed is not bad, it is quite amazing, but I need to take a step back for a little bit and reassess my relationship with weed. I dont want to be one of those ex smoker people who goes from one extreme to another, but I need to prove to myself that I am in control of my decisions and make some changes. 

I am going to take my first true t break and go for  a week . I rarely go more then 12 hours without smoking, and I dont want to do a complete 28 days or so reset as I dont have any desire to be that incapacitated when I smoke lol. If after a week I dont really have the urge, I will keep going. I want to get to under a gram a day and I would rather not smoke at all if the quality is shit.

I met with some friends at one of them’s apartment. We were smoking weed and I brought salvia with me, none of them had try it before so I was gonna play the tripsitter. Most of them had seen the videos about salvia so they were all a little scared about it, so I went to hit it first. It was a 50x extract and the trip went as usual: lasted like 4 minutes, and another 20 minutes being dizzy and feeling weird. My friends went ahead and try the salvia. I told them how to do it properly, what to expect, the mind set, the music and everything. We had a great time having salvia. We kept on smoking weed after we all had the salvia rounds and this is were things got weird. After 2 hours of taking my salvia hit, I started feeling the effects of the salvia back again, but less potent. I started feeling this fractioned-like time and loop movements. I didn’t know what was going on but then I noticed it kinda was the weed that brought me the effects back on. The salvia effects kept on getting stronger every minute so I started to panic. This lasted for about 2 hours after my last weed hit. As soon as it calmed down, I ran to my car and went back home. I dropped in my bed and as soon as I did THE SALVIA TRIP CAME BACK ON. I was there trying to deal with it for like 30 minutes until I noticed I had Clonazepam pills with me, so I took some and fell asleep. When I woke up the next morning, believe it or not, I was still feeling my body movements like in a loop, and knew it had passed over 12 hours since the salvia event, so this time I really panicked, thought I was gonna stay like that forever and took another dose of clonazepam to fall asleep again. Later when I woke up, I was ok.

I thought everything was gonna be fine, I never wanted to try salvia again. I didn’t smoke weed much often, so it was maybe 3 or 4 weeks later that I was chillin with a friend in the park and we smoked weed. 30 seconds into my first hit, i started feeling numb, vision went dark, time fractioned and my body started looping. No, it wasn’t salvia that we smoke. IT WAS WEED. And what I felt is that it reactivated the salvia leftovers in my brain, because I tripped for 10 minutes straight. A couple weeks later, smoked weed again, and the same thing happened to me.

It’s been 2 years now and I haven’t smoke weed or salvia since that time. It was truly fucking traumathizing. I like experimenting and trying stuff. Never had bad experiences with Lsd, Mdma, 2cb or whatever can come to my mind. But this experience was a NO NO NO weed/salvia for me.

My partner and I have  recently started a podcast called Trip Sitters lightly exploring the world of psychedelics and the first one we're covering is LSD.

We would love to have real stories from people describing what there trip felt like, what they experienced, and the after effects of the trip, as far as changes in the outlook on the world, changes in mental states, or new ideas about oneself brought about by the trip.

I have been prescribed Vyvanse and Adderall for years.  I recently started a grad school program about a year ago and really had to ramp up my studying.  My workload has increased a lot.

My current schedule is to take a 40 mg Vyvanse when I wake up in the morning and then a single 10 mg Adderall IR booster sometime later in the day.  Sometimes I will take two 10 mg Adderall IR boosters instead of one.  It really depends on my workload.  The max I'll take in one 24 hour period is 1 40 mg Vyvanse and 2 10 mg Adderall IRs.

I've probably been taking these for the last 200+ days straight with no breaks at all.  I used to take breaks on the weekends, but especially with staying home with my family for quarantine, I've been so distracted and stressed that I'm just taking them every day.

I need your help /r/Drugs. I don't know what to do anymore.

I think I'm going to lose my best friend and I'm so fucking scared.

I met her like 3 years ago as she was one of my buddies girlfriend's, and at some point we became super close friends. She's been going through a ton, she experienced a lot of trauma when she was younger, as well as when she went to a college about 45 minutes away from where we leave.

When we went there she ended up getting into hard drugs, pretty much absolutely anything she could get her hands on or was given. Her favorites which she has had issues with for a long time are meth and heroin, heroin being her absolute favorite (as well as fentanyl and any other opiates she can get)

I've been trying to help her since we started to become close. I studied a lot about mental health and drugs in school and on my own (I'm 19 she's 20 btw) and of course I don't know much at all, but I was able to help her some. We were able to determine she has bipolar disorder which she ended up being diagnosed with when she finally went to a psychiatrist, and got some meds however they never really helped her that much, however she also has been bad at taking them consistently which I know is super important.

I've also been trying to help her get clean. It's super hard as I'm a drug user too and we do still use stuff together, I used to smoke weed 24/7 however on 4/20 we both decided to quit our DOCs, for her meth and opiates, and weed for me. Since then we've used K together, alcohol while not a lot as she's been on the vivetrol shot this month so she can't really drink, as well as Adderall which she is prescribed.

I've tried going to NA meetings with her, had her go to a very short time rehabilitation facility (she was in for 3 days) after she overdosed on fent and alcohol at my house and I had to narcan her, I've tried having her go to a therapist which she still does but she has a super hard time opening up and being honest about everything she's dealt with, as well as just trying to talk to her, however it just hasn't done much for her.

The big issue is that she's super suicidal. She wasn't taking her bipolar meds for a while which lead her to going into an incredibly bad depressive episode. I had begged her to come by my house and talk to me before she ever decides to kill herself, and one day she came by and was incredibly suicidal, and was planning on ending it that day. Luckily she ended up staying with me, and ended up staying at my house for around 2 weeks or so, where I used a pair of handcuffs we bought at night so she couldn't go kill herself or buy H as night times are the worst for her (this is of course something she consents to).

We changed her meds, and I tried to do whatever I can to help, she is trying to set up Ketamine therapy right now, as that is supposed to be effective for both bipolar 1 as well as depression, however things just don't seem to be getting better.

We are hanging out today, she's here now, sleeping or at least laying down, and earlier when we were talking about difficult stuff, she said that she is looking forward to when she can get high again, as she can't now because of the vivetrol shot. This really broke my heart. She says she will be okay, that she will still be here when I get back (I have to leave the country for a few months on the 15th of July and I'm SO scared she is going to die while I'm gone) however with drug use it's just not something you can control. At some point she might shoot to heavy, mix stuff she shouldn't, get a bag that has a little more fentanyl in it than she expects as she doesn't mind using H with fent in it, and then it's all over. And if I can't be here to watch her and narcan her if things go bad, then I'm going to lose her.

At this point I just don't even know what to do anymore. She doesn't want her mom to know at all, even though she would pay for any rehab or treatment needed, she is so scared of her mom knowing and has told me multiple times if she gets sent to rehab or if her mom finds out her life is over and she is going to kill herself.

I don't know what to do, rehab doesn't seem an option, I can't tell her mom to try and get someone else to be able to assist who has money and can take action, she won't continue to get the vivetrol shot, there doesn't seem like anything is possible.

And I understand, for someone to get better they have to want to, it has to be there choice, it has to be their own path, but I don't want to lose my best friend. I've never met someone I can have as good of conversation with, who gets me, who thinks like me, who understands how I am and who I understand. I don't want to lose her, she's my best friend, she's so important to me, and I don't want to lose her. And she knows that, but her mental state is so bad it's hard for her to take it into consideration.

Just a bit ago before she laid down she was saying how she is a burden, and how she makes everything worse and she's just done. She's not even depressive anymore, today she was super energetic and paranoid ECT, so I'm 95% sure she's manic now, but she's still so suicidal, and with being manic she is a lot more impulsive. I feel like I need to do something asap, I know I need to try and figure this out before I leave, I don't want to lose my best friend of all time.

Please help me Reddit drugs. I'm so fucking scared and sad. I need help I need someone's opinion, I need something. Im so scared I'm going to be making an in memorial post for her on r/Drugs at some point and I don't want that.

Hey! So what im dealing with right now is a really fucked up speed comedown. I have taken around 400mg of amphetamine sulphate (Not sure about the purity but trusted vendor. And also when the comedown started I first took like 3 20mg temazepams and then had to throw them up because I felt really nauseous (probably the comedown)

and after that took 2 more and felt slightly sedated.

Now I just took 100mg more and I still dont feel much of anything, maybe just general slowness and muscle sedation but nothing too exciting.

So my question is that is it safe for me to drink like 1 or 2 cans of 500ml 4,1% beers to get some sort of a boost without it being too dangerous?

Why am I like this? It feels like more than addiction, like my brain is just fucked and it's never going to heal. I'm tired of feeling this way man. I just want to feel alive again, like when I was a kid and the simplest things made me happy. Weed makes me remember how it felt to have a direct connection to my senses, without a thick layer of negative self talk controlling the direction of my mind. Kratom makes the physical discomfort - most likely stress manifested - a little more bearable, and the colors just ever so brighter.

I never try new things. I think about it sometimes, how it seems as if I'm no longer really the one in control. Like an automaton has replaced me, and my actions are only marginally affected by my intentions. If I'm really lucky, I can catch a glimpse of the happiness I used to know. The warm, soft feeling of the sun on your skin. The joy of hanging out with friends. The optimism and ambition that makes the future appear to be more than a dead end.

I don't actually experience life directly. My perception is warped by the negative thoughts about myself and the world around me. I can't just relax and allow myself to be me - the REAL me, as I exist without an ego that insulates me from everything good this reality has to offer.

So its day 17 of complete sobriety. Which means I'm over halfway through the month of sobriety that I set out for. After day 6, I was able to sleep normally again, and boy did that first week drag the fuck on. 


Since then it actually hasn't been as hard isn't as hard as I thought it was going to be, but that is probably because subconsciously I know that this won't be isn't forever. I've kinda been [Stocking up](https://imgur.com/a/aeSw3zh) on party supplies, for when this self imposed ordeal is over.


 The thing that has tempted me the most so far was the whip its. I bought them sometime last week and when I got home I sat in front of them for an hour fighting my junkie brain's impulse to ""just take one""(it's never just one.) What also came as a surprise for me is that my chewing tobacco cravings are almost non existent, and I've been addicted since i was 19. At one point I had managed quit for a year and a half, so hopefully I won't pick it up ever again. It's really the only substance I've regretted ever trying, it just goes so well with drinking.  


Speaking of drinking, it is definitely the thing I miss the most. I was at the mall earlier getting a new outfit and I caught the smell of whiskey, probably wasn't anyone sipping whiskey at Dillard's, but I thought after this is over I should treat my self to some top shelf, hence the bottle of Green Label. I've never had it before &amp; black label is my favorite! If i ever do this again I'll break my sobriety with blue label. 


Also, turned out I have learned something about myself in this past two weeks. Namely that I want more out of life, or I guess to get back to how I used to be a few years ago. Some context on that; for the last year and some change of my life has involved me dealing with one crisis after another, Job, family, debt etc,. It seems like what came with all of that crisis hopping was stagnation in personal achievements and drive. This is not to say that my substance use was the driving factor there. My drug and alcohol usage had been stable for the last 5 years, prior to that I drank 6 days a week. I actually tend to avoid using anything when i'm very stressed out because it ruins the high. I guess I'd been of the mindset that because I don't have a serious substance abuse problem that all was well in my life. However, being sober these last two weeks has revealed to me that almost all of the highlights of the past year and some change of my life involved getting *lit af* in some capacity. I should have more highlights to look back on that aren't just me getting lit as a tit, and that's what I'll be striving for.


So in closing I'm glad I did this..... but I'd be a **GODDAMN LIAR** if I said that I actually enjoy being sober from sunup to sundown. *I fucking hate being sober.* First thing i'm doing when I wake up on July 1st is facing a blunt to myself and having a stiff glass of that green label.

I have tried nearly 70+ different chemicals. All ranging from uppers, downers, psychedelics, dissociative’s. Had some near death experiences, ect ect.

Over time I have had addictions to xanax, opiates and DXM, and of course nicotine. But who am I kidding? I am still addicted to nicotine. I suffered a lot through those times, in fact, they ruined my life. Made me homeless, ruined my best relationship i’ve ever had, destroyed my relationship with whatever family I have left. The whole shebang. But I always saw that as long as you bounce back, and become a stronger person, then it was meant to be. It was apart of your growth as a person. And to this day, I don’t regret any decision that I have made regarding my drug abuse. 

I have been sober from benzo’s and opiates for...3 years? About that. Never had a slip up. Never wished to experience what I did before. But to this DAY, i still use dissociative’s. DXM? Fuck no. Over time it gave me drug induced panic attacks even AFTER i saw sober. But when it had its magic, it was amazing. Now you may ask what do I use? 

Ketamine.

After trying Ketamine, I knew: the mental addiction to dissociative’s is quite possibly a gift and a curse. A gift it being a way of separate myself from other drugs and have no desire to do anything else. Its simply a replacement for my desire to do other things. I think a lot of people nowadays have no desire to live sober. I think humans have a natural desire to try different things that alter their consciousness. But its a curse in a way that it makes me want to do it all. the. time. But its a fight within my inner self to have moderation. I think as being somebody with an addictive personality it’s difficult to have moderation without physically separating yourself from it. 

Don’t get me wrong, Ketamine is a beautiful drug that can not only enhance your life in a lot of positive aspects, but just like any drug it can have negative side effects. I have yet to experience them other than a tolerance (sadly). But I know they are lurking in the background. And they will come. Its not a matter if, but when. 

My psychological addiction has had me reminiscing on doing psychedelics as well. But not just to do psychedelics but to mix them with ketamine. It has been reminding me of all the good times I have had on them but no so much the bad. See I think, for me, when you are in a state of dissociated consciousness, it is not easy to think about the bad. Hell, its hard to mentally think about anything other than how confusing &amp; beautiful the experience is. But these experiences are influencing me to try other things, and I know this isn’t good. Because this is how polydrug addiction happens. I have no desire to do pills, but to try other dissociative’s so I can lower my ketamine tolerance but still be dissociated. 

I’m not sure where this story is going but this is where my head is right now. And frankly, I think once you are a drug addict, no matter how sober you are, you will always be one. Psychologically. It will be a constant battle within yourself. You have to be strong if you want to beat it. But if you choose to not be sober, remember, moderation is key.

For the past 5 years I've been taking Kratom for anxiety. I wanted to find something that was herbal, and non narcotic to help me relax, and after researching both kratom and kava, decided to take kratom. 
     I used to take a pills a little when I was younger, but after getting arrested one time, decided to stop taking all narcotics and get my life in good order. 
      Well, eventually my girlfriend found out I was taking kratom, she was initially cool with it. She read something about it that freaked her out saying how ""dangerous it was"", and ever since then, she demanded that I stop taking it. I had an ultimatum: Her, and her daughter (Who I have been helping raise since 2 years old), or the Kratom. I wanted to choose her, but I kept taking kratom at work and not telling her. She would find the packs, powder residue...etc. everytime she found contraband we would fight. She would cry, I felt terrible...I lied to her. I didn't necessarily want to lie to her, but the kratom worked. 
      I told her after one of our fights that I thought she was overreacting, and that kratom is nowhere near the level of say heroin, alchohol, pain pills, etc. I told her it was unfair to give me an ultimatum, and to just let me have my little habit. It could be alot worse. She didn't see it my way. I told her I'd quit. I did quit...until, I started taking it again. She'd catch me, I'd quit, and then start the cycle all over again. It is addictive, I'll admit, but so is cigarettes...coffee.
       I had a hard time quitting nicotine, and I would never quit coffee. Just because a substance is addictive doesn't mean it's equal to every other addictive substance. We've fought over kratom more times than I can count. She's always telling me ""no drugs in our relationship"", and ""you can take your drugs and leave"". My response  is always ""Will you stop calling it drugs? I only started taking it because I didn't want to take drugs."" She doesn't see the difference.
       Today, she says that she found a speck of kratom on the dash of the car. Now I'm in for a fight when she comes home. She's going to tell me that she thinks we should break up like she always does...I'm so worn down by it all. I have lied about it over and over, so I'm not innocent in all of this. I am not bad to her. I don't hit her, don't degrade her, don't cheat...I lie about a kratom habit.
       I have made a serious effort to quit, but every time I break down and take a little dose, or a shot if I had a stressful day(sometimes I'll buy just enough for one dose or a viva zen), it's like she finds out about it. I would love to be able to say that kratom is 100% out of my life, and for the most part it has been. I've been good lately, but here I am waiting for her to come home. Waiting for my fight.

How does higher management not notice this ? And when they do I guarantee the daily mail will make an article titled “do you want drugs with that ?” or something along those lines.

Since the end of 2018 im just smoking weed and had a dozen short relapse binges with speed ect. Im wondering if the weed is whats keeping my personality from fluorishing again or whatever.

I just turned 21 so this has been going on for a long time. Ive lost pretty much all my friends except for a couple people in the same situation as me but they are trainwrecks and hanging out with them aint no good. Im good looking blonde blue eyes so i get girls attention but after a short convo with me they nope the fuck out of there. I only get one night stands because when drunk i can be myself. So things are pretty shit this makes my depression deeper i have to sell weed to pay bills becuse i hurt my arm and had to quit my 1month job at construction, and i cannot be without smoking if its in the house. I was sober at the construction site, this seemed like it helped a bit but im not sure if it was because i was actually in a social setting most of the day at the cons site. 

My mind just blanks and i have this obsession to be funny and worthy of company when im around people. I feel like i need to entertain them with my social skills since this problem has become. Theres no spark or i have no interest towards the other person, i cant really pay attentiont to them or when i do the mind blanks up real quick. I try to but its like theres a wall. When i was at school i always had easy time making friends mut now ive just lost it since this sorry ass dope shit.. 

Hope someone else has had this experience or actually i dont but if u have tell me what the fuck to do.

\*Advice please.\*  
People who have been through it: How long did it take before the brain zaps went? How long till the withdrawal effects went fully? What helped?

Paxil is just plain evil and I really wished I had known beforehand but I stupidly trusted my doctor. Never again will I put something in my body without researching heavily.

I remember googling, ""Is pot cocaine?"" because i was not sure if they were smoking cocaine or weed. It was the start of my long career with drugs.

By 18 I had dabbled in psychedelics, research chemicals, prescription pills, alcohol, weed, goddamn anything I could get my hands on. For a while I sold synthetic cannabinoids like AM-2201 on little foils. Probably 30mg or so melted on there for $5. Am-2201 didn't get sticky when you let it melt. It would harden on the foil and stay nice and tidy. If you left it too long you could break it off into chunks but that was about it. 

Now I'm 25 but I feel 13 because I don't know a goddamn thing about the world. Instead of asking questions about drugs, I'm sitting here typing shit like ""quickest high paying career"" and ""IBEW apprenticeship requirements"". I joined khan academy and when they asked what my education level was I picked ADULT EDUCATION like a goddamn fucking loser who has done nothing with the past 10+ years of his life.

I have weed and alcohol but I try to use it sparingly. 2oz of liquor a day and I only use weed at night time or very early in the morning when I want to play Okami and wait for the kratom, caffeine, and phenibut to reach my brain.

I just feel at this point there is no saving me. Years of not giving a fuck about my mental or physical health have taken their toll on me. I counted up all the recreational drugs I've done before and depending on how you calculate what is recreational or not I've done about 40-70 different substances. Wow. How fucking cool I am.

The only kind of job I can get is with kids who are as old as my mental state, so I fit right in. 18 year olds come to me like I'm some fucking guru asking me what LSD was like and if I saw anything crazy. I'm so over it. I don't want to talk to people anymore.

I play 5 different instruments but I'm not good at any of them. I write daily, but I can't finish a single book after 5 years of trying. I'm a pretty good artist as well, but I only draw on sticky notes. Years and years of attempts at self improvement have all been in vain, because I can't apply myself hard enough to get anywhere with any of my attempts. I've dropped out of school more times than I can count and at this point I don't even feel real anymore. I feel as if I am looking at the world behind a pane of glass. Depersonalization, I know. I google everything. It's literally the only fucking thing I'm good at.

I feel like I'm genuinely likeable when I try. I'm possibly bipolar. I don't know. I've never been to a psychologist or psychiatrist, and my insurance is about to die because I neglected to give them information they've been asking about for months. Just another way I've let my life rot away.

I don't know what the solution is. I don't even give enough of a fuck to be suicidal, I just don't know how to change things. I used to have goals but now I don't know what I want other than a job that can gift me with at least some level of comfort and stability. The one good thing in my life, and the reason I'm not dead or homeless, is my family. And before you say it, NO I am not talking to them about this shit. They know I do drugs and they just ignore it as long as I'm not super fucked up. It's a hard conversation, I get it. They try helping in other ways.

I really don't know how to fix myself. I've most definitely fucked up my brain and body with drugs. I don't know if I can be salvaged and actually be a contributing member of society. When the lockdown here ended I actually had a job to go back to. I got up in the morning, showered, ate, got dressed, drove to work.... and then I just drove past it. Zip. My boss, being the nice guy he is, is still putting me on the schedule then removes me a few days before because I have not answered any emails or calls. They're giving me a chance and it's been like 3 weeks, but I don't have the balls to go in and either make up a lie or tell the truth. I want to dig a hole, grab my $12 handle of vodka, and go to sleep.

I'm not even bad with people or anything, fuck. I make friends easily I just drop them like flies when i get depressed. I've hitchhiked across the country and gone to foreign countries on the other side of the planet by myself. I'm not totally ugly either. When I grew out my hair I had random ass women telling me how nice my hair looked. I could probably find another girlfriend if I gave a fuck. But I just don't care. I don't care about anything.

I'm pretty sure I enter manic phases as well because sometimes I just get really angry for no reason and it lasts for days. I have to just isolate myself in my room so I don't say some dumb shit. There are days where I don't utter a word out loud and where I don't get up except to go to the bathroom or get food. 

I don't know. I am just tired. That's all. I'm pretty sure I could stop using drugs entirely if I just found some purpose in life. 99% of the time when I use drugs it is because I am bored, depressed, anxious, or some other emotion that I'm trying to cover up because I never learned to deal with it in a healthy way. I don't know if I will ever live a life where I can feel proud of myself. It seems easier just to die but I don't actually want that, I just want shit to get better.

Gonna drink the rest of this vodka so I can bottle up my feelings in it later.

The first line was fairly buzzy/stimmy...after that it had a very slight rolly mashy feeling like 20% MDMA maybe. Not a great deal of euphoria. I was horny but nothing like speed horn. But the dry mouth! Couldn't even kiss let alone do oral or anything, it was worse than coke amphetamine and MDMA.

Last line was at 5am, few hours later started to get a headache (I am prone to them after a much longer speed session but usually a couple of diazepam sorts they out). Then the comedown left me feeling depressed, almost suicidal, and despite taking 30mg of diazepam between 8 and 9.30 am I couldn't sleep until around midday.

Am I missing something? Just feels like it is nowhere near as good as speed, MDMA or coke.

MDMA is way more euphoric and I can sleep after. The next day I feel worse physically but not depressed.

Coke is more euphoric and I can sleep after. Not too much of a comedown.

I got off the boat with 16k in the bank I had been smoking meth a bit with an ex gf but I was itching. I flew to Perth and met up with one of dads mates and got half an Oz for 8k. My mate who I was smoking with didnt believe me I could get this good shit, I came back with it and he was in aw. I had 5 days off before I went back out to sea for another month. I stayed up those whole 5 days (my longest awake was 9 days, thats when the serious loop outs started) we just smoked hard in his house and thought people with guns were in his backyard every night. 

I got a lift back up to the town where the vessel left the port with a good friend and her friend, it was 14 hours of driving up north. We got to the final 3 hours when my worst loop out kicked in. After driving through a town we just so happened to have a cop car driving behind us. I had 3 grams on me and the loop out kicked in. I thought my friend and her friend were undercover cop men dressed as girls (could see their light faint moustaches hahah) I started screaming pls dont kill me, I pretended to throw the gear out the window. At this point my friends friend had worked out I was smoking meth and confiscated my pipe. We were way out of town now like 30-50km in the middle of nowhere. I kept yelling pull over but she wouldnt. I grabbed the steering wheel to pull us over and she thought I was trying to steer us into an oncoming truck. We swerved they started crying and pulled over. I thought they were trying to kill me and im pretty sure they thought I was trying to kill them. Im not a violent person at all I feared for my life. We got out and they started pulling over cars. these 4 tourists came to help and the girls got back into the car. I thought the tourists were more undercover cops to come and finally kill me I ran to the car and put my fingers through the tiny slit at the top of the cracked window and pulled. It shattered everywhere and the girls screamed their lungs out. They pulled over another truck and this guy just happened to know my mum. They said go back into town and call the cops. He didnt though he rang my mum instead and she started heading our way. I was fortunate the cops didnt come because I still had the 3 grams on me. I hid them in the bush. And I suddenly came to my senses. I appologised to everyone and the girls agreed to take me to the nearest gas station where mum actually was waiting. I counted 48 reflector sticks along side the road to a yellow bin. Then counted 3 yellow bins to the gas station which was an hour away. The next night my friend and I went out there and got the gear. I fucking found it and we smoked it. Will never forget it.

Covid was a wake up call for me and I don’t intend to go back to using it ever again. I tried to look online for helpful articles but I couldn’t find much.

Our research team at Square2 Systems is conducting a study to evaluate new   features of a mobile app. The app is designed to help people with   substance use disorders learn science-based strategies to help them stop using drugs. These new features are designed to be used along with a   friend, family member, or acquaintance. The information we learn in this   study will help us better understand how useful the app may be as part   of substance use treatment/recovery support.

You might be eligible to participate in this study if you are:

· Over 18 years of age

· In treatment for a substance use disorder and/or in recovery

· Have a friend, family member, or acquaintance who does not use substances and can participate in this study with you.

If  you are interested, you and your support person would be asked to join  a  video call with a research team member. Each of you would be asked  to  download the app to your phones and test out three features of the  app.  These features are designed for your friend, family member, or   acquaintance to provide positive support.

You would then be asked to use the app for 2 weeks and complete some   questionnaires to tell us about your experience using the app.

This study is being conducted by Square2 Systems via a grant from the U.S.   National Institute on Drug Abuse. This study has been approved by a   research ethics board.

Basically, because I'm aware of how addictive and dangerous long-term benzo use can be, I'm taking 1mg of Xanax like every 7-20 days. It depends, sometimes I go 20 days and another time it can be only 7 or 8 days. I just really enjoy the way I can sleep on it, totally unbothered and calm.

Does this cause harm or addiction in the long run? Because even if I took only 1mg every 12 days, it would add up to 30 pills a year.

1) The prescribed dosage, with which I felt no euphoria/confidenceboost/basicallyjustoldgoodtimeout, was clearly ridiculous for the confidence/talkativeness/energy/sexualreactivity/euphoricmood I was looking for to replace coke (30 mg x day, again). Yesterday night only while having a few drinks a I took around 120 mg - if not something more - orally, which at that point started giving me the coke feeling I was craving. (Woman!, 29 y.o., pretty athletic, 177cm x 59kg). 

2) I took my 120 and plus mg orally redosing like every hour. Would have it been much better, instead, if taken all together OR crushing my pills and snorting them? Still, all together or if you act like it's coke it should be at least 3 dosages (up to 7 or 8 when you snort 1 gram of pure stuff).
There were times as the effect was going down I absolutely needed another pill and had to wait 10/15 mins before feeling fine again. 

3) LAST: hideous comedown. While I am an experienced coke user (1 straight clean gram of great coke every other night until a few months ago) I just knew after my amusing night outs that popping 3/4 xanax in bed made me black out. With Ritalin taken orally, it took me almost 3 hours and 8 xanax (immediate release). I was almost scared. I felt anxious and apathic like after coke wears off, but it was like I needed thrice the xanax to help me eventually sleep as I supposed it was because you have to snort it (maybe?).

Please can comeone confirm that the problem with me was not crushing my pills so as they were swallowed they stayed in my sistem longer and stronger than coke that's why xanax did so little? AND, on average, how many pills do people crush for recreational use to make it feel similar to coke?

It's a very tough thing to argue for especially since she obviously cares about me... And she's never tried mdma herself to know how great it is.

I agreed to stop doing it after a festival during the summer, but overtime it felt as if I was beginning to resent her because I was missing doing it with friends. So told her that I want to do it at most 4times a year, yet it's still always a big arguement the day before I head out to do it.

But out of the blue, even after being told by campus security and the police that I wont be arrested or charged with anything etc. I got the letter. who knew cops lied /s

&amp;#x200B;

But here is where it is bugging me. I just finished school, so I have no reason to use ritalin anymore as I was abusing it quite badly. I also am very close to getting treatment for my chronic back pain (burst fracture L5) with stem cells which would most likely mean no more pain. which means no more pain meds. And tbh at 20 and being on pain meds since I was 17, I would love to be able to be free from them, but who knows how realistic that actually is.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, this past wednesday the 10th I went on a first date with a really cute and nice girl who seems to really like me and I really like her (we been talking for months prior but only had our irl date this last wednesday) 

&amp;#x200B;

I think it was friday night, I got really high (I have a med card, I dont like smoking daily as it makes me foggy and usually can increase pain depending on how much I smoke believe it or not, I use it to get to sleep and eat more since im a skinny eboy lookin ass) Anyways on that friday night, I was thinking on where my life was headed and what it looks like. At that time I had 0 idea I was getting charged with a felony. I told myself, and acctually began taking action for the first time in forever, because I had something to do it for. Even though we just started dating, she became the excuse I needed to say fix your fucked life. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm ranting, and I just wanted to tell someone who might believe me, I wanted to get sobor and began steps prior to this ""wake up call"" of being charged. But it'll just end up looking like I got sobor or cleaned up my life because of the charge, ie forced deferment program with drug classes and tests etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

And to add, I have been calling lawyers all day every day since monday to find the best one and how to pay for them.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m thinking that if there is money in Hell, it would most likely be molecules of water. It would be a cryptocurrency called Water Satoshi. 1 Bitcoin of water would be 1 drop, and there would be 1.5 sextillion satoshi in 1 Bitcoin. Because there are 1.5 sextillion molecules in 1 drop of water.

So when the rich man asked Lazarus asked for a drop of water he was actually asking for a lot of Hell-money, an entire Bitcoin of water. 1.5 sextillion Water Satoshi.

You would earn Water Satoshi in Hell by willingly undergoing extra torture or taking a job. Most jobs would be low-paid hard labor, while the best jobs would involve torturing others.

So instead of asking for handouts the rich man should have started working and earning those Water Satoshi. Once he saved up 1.5 sextillion Satoshi he could exchange it for the drop of water to cool his burning tongue.

Other ways to spend the Water Satoshi would be on houses, fire extinguishers, air conditioning, food, computers, phones, TVs, and mining rigs to mine more Water Satoshi. But water would be the most expensive thing in Hell. 1 drop of water would probably buy many houses.

So if you’re really rich in Hell you could afford an air conditioned house, food deliveries, and entire cups of water. While the poor would be working for Hell Postmates delivering the rich food and water for only several Water Satoshi per hour.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,686631,public,confidence,self,Will molecules of water be a cryptocurrency in Hell?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hamjam/will_molecules_of_water_be_a_cryptocurrency_in/,no_ads,0.0,1592407639.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These tabs were said to be double-dosed, but you can't really say for sure. My tolerance was decent, but my friends were way better. The trip was going fine until one of my friends threw up. This didn't scare me, but it unsettled me since I was worried it could happen to me. I started to experience time loops, see hallucinations, and eventually, my vision was the same thing as being blinded in Minecraft (you can only see like 5ft in front of you). I started to relax more and gaze at a plasma ball for a bit, something about it pissed me off though. I don't remember, but the plasma ball started talking shit to me, so I punched it with my left hand. There was blood everywhere -- I couldn't make a fist with my left hand for two months afterward -- my friends immediately sent me to the kitchen to wash my hands; but when I put my hands in the water, I didn't feel anything. All the nerves in my body just stopped working, I couldn't feel anything at all. This scared me because of how unfamiliar it was, so I jumped on top of an island and screamed as loud as I could. My friends shoved me down and tried to physically shut me up. That is where I believe the ego death started.

One of my friends lured me outside with his phone flashlight like I was a moth or something. I was at the front patio of the house and I just passed out. Thankfully, I fell into the plants by the side, and not the concrete steps. So, I was blacked out with tabs streaming through my head. I remember I was just floating in a white void. I wasn't going in a specific direction, but I was just floating. Over time, I started seeing floating shapes everywhere, the shapes were a darker side of white but outlined in dark black. There were only two shapes: Cubes and cones. The shapes were floating together in harmony, almost like they were friends. I started to realize I was in an unnatural setting, I did not know where I was. This freaked me out, and the shapes started attacking each other. The world started turning black and everything disappeared. I don't know what this was, but I saw an energy of sorts. The energy asked me ""Why were you put on Earth?"" ""Why do you deserve to experience things?"" ""What makes you human?"" I answered all these questions, but I kept it to myself. I somehow knew the energy was aware of all my answers, though. Finally, I was asked, ""Do you want to leave?"" Confused, I said yes, then I died.

This is the part that fucked with me and still does fuck with me. I was witnessing the destruction of my very own ego. My family, friends, morals, beliefs, literally everything I ever knew was crumbling in such an artistic way in front of me. I cannot describe the disappearance of my ego well at all, it's like trying to describe a new color. That whole experience was so horrifying to me because it was so unfamiliar, I just wasn't ready for all that. I now understand why people say"" Before you die, life flashes before your eyes."" Our ego is what makes us human. It is built from the day we were born, to lose our own ego is unimaginable. I lost my sense of self; thus, gaining a connection with everything else; so, I felt like everything at once. My identity, not even my identity, everything, and everyone's identity were the exact same. Everything is connected.

After this realization, I entered a state of pure bliss. It was an expansive, stunning feeling of freedom from my own body and identity. I felt detached from my bonds; this allowed me to gain awareness. I was aware of everything, it might me feel like a God. I felt like I was the universe, it was incredible. I can't really describe the rest, just the feeling of it was insane.

After that, I regained consciousness. I was still extremely fucked up physically, I had trouble seeing and moving, so I just stayed on the dirt and looked at the stars above me. This made me feel really small, it made me think about how our lives are insignificant in the grand scheme of the universe.  This didn't make me sad, though. I thought about how every answer I would ever want is inside of me. It made me realize how little time I spend with my parents, I felt bad about that. I then thought: ""Was I meant to have an ego-death?"" Overall, I think this experience benefitted me, it allowed me to realize the beauty of life. It just made me a happier person.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,686630,public,confidence,self,My Experience With An Ego Death - Trip Report,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hami76/my_experience_with_an_ego_death_trip_report/,no_ads,0.0,1592407488.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four years ago I took 100mg MDMA with some friends and my sleep quality has been in ruins ever since. The first night after the trip I soaked my bed in sweat in some kind of half awake, half night mare state, and every single night for the first year I would wake up in a massive pool of sweat, feeling awful, tired and depressed. Nightly sweats have diminished, spare for some nights, but I still wake up feeling like shit in some kind of zombie, brain fog state. Falling to sleep can be tricky if I don't get enough sunlight and I still clench my jaw. My friends all fully recovered in a matter of days. Being on anti depressants helps falling asleep, but does not make me feel refreshed or rejuvenated in the morning like an ordinary night of sleep would before all this.

We tested the MDMA at that public drug lab in Spain for 80% purity, with no traces of PMMA or other cuts. To be on the safe side we also took all the vitamins and supplements suggested by the drug nerds out there. I was on no medication at the time.

Depending on the drug to function at all, is what most people would consider “addiction”, but dependency is worse. The point where you depend on it to live, and you’ve fed your entire self to the fiend.

Meth is the “hardest” and most addictive drug I do regularly (love xans too but neither compare to my love for Mary Jane, hands down the most addictive drug I’ve done) and I KNOW I’m not the only fool that’ll use it for work. If you can control yourself when your off it, why wouldn’t you apply all of that energy into your money maker, then it just pays for itself. 

Most of the notions people have about addicts come from what they see the homeless do and then blame it on the drug, because you can’t possibly literally go insane from just giving up on life, feeling nothing but the fiending desire for more dope.

How many of y’all use every day and still pay your bills, feed yo babys, USE RESPONSIBLY, maybe even paying off a mortgage or perhaps a business owner? How many people here have more of a hobby or a dependence than a habit. I do meth and xans on the daily, stoned throughout it all, and would still drop the bars and T long before I even considered quitting weed, which as we all know is legally impossible, because meth IS the most addictive substance on earth.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,686623,public,confidence,self,How many of you are bonafide addicts that live a completely normal/successful life?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ham57c/how_many_of_you_are_bonafide_addicts_that_live_a/,no_ads,0.0,1592405753.0,Custom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I shot up, was panicked and my heart was RACING. I didn't know where I was right away or how much time had gone by. It was just like a black hole in time. I didn't nod off or anything like that. Just out like a light then shot back up.

I'm currently nauseous and itchy as fuck but my lips aren't blue. Did I overdose and somehow luckily come back on my own? Or was this just a heavy nap?

I’m super pissed at the way movies portray acid and how everyone’s “eXpErIeNcE” is purple dragons fighting green elephant-lions.

Around two years ago, friend drives over and we’re gonna browse Netflix and play some COD or some shit like that. He walks in, takes off his coat and placed a baggie on the coffee table. Now, at this point it was already 11:00 PM so I can’t remember the exact details by he just tells me “it’s just some acid bro try it”.

So, I try it. I pop one in my mouth, under my tongue and sit back and put on some comedians. It hits a little while later, I don’t remember it was two years ago. Friend falls asleep on my couch (he didn’t take any, the bastard).

I make my way to my bedroom and turn on the light. I remember just looking around my room and trying to find patterns on the layout of the carpet. This is why I get so mad when people talk about seeing mythical beasts and shit when more than likely they wouldn’t have taken enough and wouldn’t have handled it correctly to actually have seen the things they say they saw.

I researched all day about the specific concerta that I have to little avail, and the only thing I did find gave bad information. The ones I have are white and round. Place that bitch in between your jaws where the pill is pinned between your teeth sideways, and slooowwwly bite down. You might want to keep your mouth open and let it fall out of your mouth once you feel it break. It might break slowly, or it might split, or pop perfectly in half. Cup your hands around your mouth so the pieces don't fly everywhere. One half of the pill on the inside is blue. one half is white. I snorted the blue half on my first experiment- I was going off bad information. That blue powder that I ground up acted like an airbag inside my nose, so I had to wash it down with baking soda nasal spray.
(sky/baby) Blue half observations: The blue half, after separated from the white (creamy) half, had two layers still on it- The outside (plain) white layer and a thin foggy wax layer. Peel the white layer from both halves and set them aside (They are 1/3 methylphendiate). If the white layer is not easily peeling off after breaking the pill in half, place the half right under your canine tooth and just lightly crack it. That will turn the shell into smaller pieces, but will become easily removable. Once separated, I placed one blue half inside a waterbottle to dissolve, and it didn’t really dissolve at all. As the water experiment was going on, I let a few other blue halves sit in liquid butane until they were air dried- I did that twice. I tried crushing up the half and it was rock solid, so I put it in isopropyl alcohol and heated it to a boil. It turned into jello. From there I was 90% sure that he blue side is the extended release sponge. Its very salty in taste.
The (creamy) White half: also has two layers. Save the top white layer, peel the wax with either a razor or just keep picking at that bitch with your nails.....OR you can leave it on. It makes little to no difference in accordance to my recommendation of administration. I soaked this half in water and it did not change in shape or size- same as the blue. The consistency was entirely different. The isopropyl did the same thing to it- nothing. I started stabbing it with a screwdriver...for science. The powder reacted to the water and turned into an extremely thick,slimey, sticky clay consistency.
I thought that the blue half that I consumed, at the time, was the methylphenidate, and shortly after consuming it, my mouth started tingling in the same way cocaine makes you your mouth feel, but I really had to step back and think about whether it was placebo or not. I was relatively focused the entire day, only to have consumed one blue half in that timeframe, while I was doing these little experiments, but I was not feeling any euphoria.
I saved the white halves just in case I found out more information later about them and whether I ended up taking the wrong half. That was exactly the case. I had 4-5 36mg white halves saved. I said fuck it and told myself that no matter how nasty these bitches are to chew, I have to chew them in order to test and see if the white halves were the halves containing the methylphenidate. If I took them whole, they wouldn't have kicked in quick enough. It is to my assumption that you cannot snort them because your nasal cavity will become filled with clay.
The best way to take the white halves is to strip the thin layer wax coats and try your absolute bestest at turning them into powder for oral ingestion. My logic is that if it is broken up before ingestion, it will not become a dense and slowly dissolving glob in your stomach. I simply did not have the time nor the luxury of making as much noise as I wanted to crush it. I popped 4-5 of them bitches as whole halves-with the wax still on- in my mouth and started chewing away. I tried to swallow as little as possible as fast as possible before they absorbed moisture. Once it all started becoming icky and ewwy and globby all over my molars, I tried to swallow a small amount at a time with water as a chaser. I had to pick it out of my teeth and scrape as much as possible off in lieu of cleaning it with my tongue- because the taste wasn’t pleasant. After getting as much off as I could with my finger, I resorted to licking the shit out of the rest so it would dissolve off of my teeth. I then took all the peeled white shells, put them under my tongue all at once, and let them dissolve, intermittently swabbing it around so it broke up faster.
Dissolving the white shell on my tongue felt like quality cocaine x1.5. It is also similar in taste to cocaine. I put roughly 4 or 5 pills worth of shells under my tongue all at once, and my mouth was numb. They melted together quickly, and I had no discomfort. The (creamy) White half had a similar taste to the shells. The shells got me instantly riled up, so whichever half of the pill tasted like the shells was the half that contains the methylphenidate. Therefore, I finally determined with 100% certainty that the white half is the methylphenidate and the blue half is the sponge.
If you have a generic that isn't exactly like mine, your shell will still be 1/3 methylphenidate. To determine which half or section contains the methylphenidate, taste each half or section. If it tastes bitter, narcotic-ey, dull like flower, and cocaine-like in the slightest, then that is it. If you cant tell, do what is necessary to make sure you have a distinct determination. If you take the wrong half or section and just say fuck it and take a different half or section, you're not gonna find out which is which.
Of course gaining access to the instant releases is your best bet, but if you manage to stumble upon the extended releases and want to put them to the best possible use, follow my instructions loosely. Theres always room for improvement- like idk taking white halfes interanally or however you scientifically say,”up your ass”. I could not tell you if that route is more effective or not. Make sure you eat a light meal- if any- before doing this for max effect. This concludes my Ted Talk. I hope to help out at least two people.

P.S. I take adderall and am subject to random urine drug testing administered by a private testing and tracking company that is hired by the federal government.The specific urine drug test that I take is a dip test made by Premiere Biotech. They are a wholesale custom drug test company. there are 8 strips in one test. Each strip is capable of testing for two different substances. I am under the impression that in my case, each strip tests for one substance. Here is why. I took the test today, one day after taking a plethura of methylphenidate. When he dipped the stick into the cup, one panel turned red as fuck on the back of the test- because i could only view the back. Another panel turned slightly red. The rest of the strips were clear. That means the substance that is detected is going to turn that specific strip testing for said substance red. How much that stup turns red depends on how much of that substance is in the urine. So the most useful things to take away from this information is this: I assume the ultra-red strip was for amphetamines because amphetamine salts only test positive for amphetamine salts. I believe that the slightly red strip tested for methamphetamine, and the methylphenidate was the reason the methamphetamine strip turned red at all. With a potent amount of methylphenidate in that urine sample, it managed to show up as a false positive for methamphetamine, BUT it was not positive enough for the administer to raise any flags.

When I was young my family would sometimes watch Christian movies and ""Heaven is For Real"" was one we particularly liked.\n\nIf you don\'t already know the movie is about a kid who dies for like a minute while under surgery and sees God.  I think one of two drug related things happened during that surgery.\n\n1.  The kid in the movie was anesthetized for the surgery and most likely anesthetized with [ketamine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine).  Ketamine is a dissociative psychedelic that is just also a pretty good anesthetic.  Ketamine was also synthesized as an analog of the infamous PCP.  Ketamine is usually used in the anesthetization of children or in animals hence its nickname as ""horse tranquilizers.""  The explanation for the kid\'s experience most likely lies within the dosage of ketamine given to him.  At large doses ketamine can call what users have dubbed as the ""k-hole"" which makes the user feel like they are dying or are in a near death experience.  Some users who experience the ""k-hole"" also experience religious experiences.  A recent [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-66023-8) from Cambridge shows that in large doses ketamine can stop brain activity for a bit when given a dose of 28 mg/kg causing this experience.  So if The kid was given enough ketamine then the ketamine would have caused the minute shutdown of his brain activity, making him think he was in heaven.  Since the ketamine was given to a kid the ketamine could have acted stronger on the brain or the anesthesiologists simply gave him too much because they werent sure on the dosage.  It is important to note that the kid in the movie could have been given a different anesthetic but ketamine is very prevalent to use in child surgery.\n\n2.  The kid in the movie did clinically die for a small amount of time which causes me to believe that his brain released [DMT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine), or a similar substance [5-MeO-DMT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-MeO-DMT).  Both substances are found in the human brain and are released upon death.  Many users of this substance says that it makes them feel like they are dying.  There are even [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6107838/) showing that DMT is very similar to a near death experience and actually models a near death experience.  It is very likely that during the clinical death of the child his body released a large amount of DMT while his MAO enzyme was impaired (the MAO enzyme keeps us from being high off of our endogenous DMT all the time), causing the child\'s experience described in the book and in the movie.  This is actually the explanation that I use for all christian stories about seeing god or heaven after almost dying.  \n\nI could of course be wrong on both of these but at the very least this explanation seems plausible to me.  The kid could have also had a mix of both experiences.  Since ketamine causes a pause in brain activity the kid\'s brain could have released tons of DMT.\n\nTL;DR the kid from the movie was high.', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many of you I was raised on a Christian upbringing but later in my life dropped those beliefs.

I'm last in line and a mixture of nervous and excited, I step up and snort the small amount off the tip of a house key. Nothing happens, no bad taste, no weird sensation in my nose, not what I expected but I'm a bit relieved my worries were for nothing.

My friends ask questions like ""what's your name?"" And ""who is the president?"" To which I am able to accurately and quickly provide answers. They start asking about my past medical history which is pretty clean, they were interested in if I have had any seizures before, I had one about 15 years ago after absolutely smashing my head on a tile floor. After that they revealed to me that when I lost consciousness the first time I had appeared to be having a seizure.

At the moment I have absolutely no plans on trying coke again. Does anybody have an idea of what caused this to happen, or has seen this before?

Everything in moderation tho I don’t like being an addict to any drug even tho I’m addicted to nic until Thursday. I’m gonna try and quit today tho. I haven’t smoked in a month and I’m really hyped to smoke rn. I don’t really like being on drugs that much these days in general. I feel like they lower my intellect while I’m on em. I want to be able to have the will power to only do drugs on my “weekend.” The 2 days in a row I have off which are Wednesday and Thursday. That way I’m not full blown potato IQ like I used to be. I want to get back into psychs as a monthly thing because I like the visuals and self reflection while I play games. 

I feel like these days I’m too far gone on the wrong path. Even tho I really like the wrong path, the adrenaline, and the ego boost that this path brings, I don’t like having the knowledge that I’m a shitty person. I try to be nice while I’m a shitty person like that wreck it Ralph quote. Where he says you can be a bad guy but not be a a bad guy. I wish I could take back the things I’ve done and be the good person I turned myself into over the years with psychs and hard work. Now I’m just a criminal and a waste to society. I don’t think I can turn back. I’m too far along the path I chose. Sorry for the rant it helps my conscious if I type these things out. Does anyone have any tips for how to leave this life behind when you know you’re finally done with it? I feel like it’s not worth becoming a good person again because the world has become so shitty. I’m scared we will get to a point where everyone is a bad person and I’ll be too nice so I end up dead. I don’t want to die. My one motivation was taken away and I feel like I have nothing left to base my decisions on. Everyone around me is moving forward in life while I just become more and more evil. I’m getting more and more paranoid and I feel like people are out to get me. Can’t specify who but you’d be able to make an educated guess. I don’t want myself to end up like it does for countless others. Like how it ended up for my brother and some of my friends. Dead or in jail. I just know I’d rather die than go to jail again. It’s a stupid thing to say but it’s not worth living if everyone else is looking down on my mugshots in disgust or pity. I can’t be in there I can’t handle the stress. I just wish I made the right decisions in life so I wouldn’t be where I’m at now. Every time there’s a knock on the door I run and throw on shoes and grab my bag ready to dip. It’s always someone trying to sell me something but I don’t like being scared like this.

That being said, I have a question and google/reddit didn't really gave me a clear answer. Will my ADD prescription (54mg concerta) interfere with my experience?

I've been taking my medication for a bit more than a year now and I feel normal when I take it (not buzzed/stimmed at all except for when I drink my coffee in the morning).

My uncles were heavy drug addicts and my other side of the family had alcohol problems. I grew up drinking from around 16 to deal with then unknown anxiety problems. I couldn't hang with friends unless I'd had a beer.

Later I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and autism. I spent 15 years of my life drinking daily as a functioning alcoholic. I quit alcohol and then went to cannabis. I started daily smoking. It costs more than the alcohol! Yet, I don't function or survive without cannabis. I'm a software developer and no work gets done unless I've had a joint. Without that joint I'm bed ridden with nasty anxiety and withdrawal type effects.

I've tried tapering. I'm currently only smoking .5g a day. That's the lowest I've ever been and I've brought it down a lot. I used to smoke 4-5g a day.

But the tapering isn't going well. On days I don't have cannabis I'm non functional and instead have to resort to prescribed diazepam (although I take more than I'm meant to). I've also recently started using codine and extracting the paracetamol from co-codomol using cold water extraction.

Without cannabis or the new found opiates I'm angry, agitated. I hate the world. I cause arguments with people. I want to fight/kill everyone I see.

I've battled this for a long time. Many years. The only help I can see me getting is rehab, but I can not imagine a life without a distraction from the madness that is called reality. I can feel myself edging to prescription painkillers as a replacement for when I don't have cannabis.

I'm almost 40 btw. Physically healthy and work out but I know this is a problem in the making.

Problem is I don't want to quit. I enjoy this lifestyle. I'm so much more productive on some sort of drug that allows me to be productive. People have suggested I have ADD type behaviours and I may need a medication to stay focused. But that's out of the frying pan into the fire.

No weed today but I've dropped about 20mg diazepam, overdosed on promazine to purposely sleep away the hellish day. It's not an overdose to cause harm, just more than I'm meant to take because this drug usually knocks me out. It's prescribed.

I've managed to get by without my doctor noticing I'm using more. Every time I call for a repeat a week or so early they don't even question it. I'm on promazine, paroxatine, and diazepam for mental health problems. If I'm every without these drugs I become a psychopath. That's the reason I'm on promazine. 

But you know what ... without any of those meds I can smoke weed and do without them. It's just illegal in my country to get medical cannabis.

i was on 320ug acid at like 4pm on a thursday home alone and right before the peak i took a small line of k as well, i was also smoking weed throughout the whole of the trip

i sat down to play some minecraft (which is INCREDBILE on acid) and i completely forgot where i was and what i was doing and that i had ever taken acid (even though i was still tripping very hard so fuck knows how i didn’t realise), i walked around the house and started getting really freaked out cause i didn’t recognise anything and was trying to yell for someone but no one was home 

i freaked tf out and ran out of the house and as i was looking at the street i just didn’t recognise it and thought i was lost and i had absolutely no fucking clue how i got into that house in the first place

my first thought was to call for a taxi so i ordered an uber to collect from my current location to my last place burnsville (fake name for obvs reasons) and sat on the sidewalk for what felt like millenniums but i remember just laughing at the sky for a bit

the taxi driver called me which scared the fuck out of me, and he asked if that was me sat on the floor, i literally didn’t even see that he had pulled up like 2 metres from my face and almost fell back in shock when i looked and it just appeared out of no where

i got in and he greeted me asked if i wanted music and i just could not comprehend human contact right now and just said i don’t know - he played the music anyway which i ended up liking (also burnsville is roughly a 45 minute drive away from my house and is also quite expensive by taxi)

i was just sat in the taxi listening to the radio the guy had on, looking out the window and enjoying myself, he tried to strike up conversation a few times and i can’t remember exactly what but i do know i just gave him really blunt one word answers 

then out of nowhere my entire memory refreshed, it whacked me out of no where and i felt like a vrpmhhhh sound would feel as a feeling and i just screamed STOP and asked him where we were, he told me we were in some small ass village i had never heard of and can’t for the life of me remember the name of, so i started freaking out again and explained the situation including the drugs, he laughed then looked concerned and asked if i needed to go to the hospital, i just asked him to take me home.

we got back to mine and he offered to help me inside - i declined but it was a nice gesture.

rami if you read this you’re an absolute legend and i have the upmost respect for you! we need more people like you

safe tripping guys

tldr: got wrecked on acid, ket and weed, forgot where i was, panicked n ordered a taxi to come get me and told the driver to take me to some random place 45 mins away from my house, realised after half way what happened and explained to the driver, he was super chill and friendly took me home and that was that

basically if you ever abused a drug heavily, for a sustained period of time, you will eventually reach that substance's addiction thresehold, for drugs like heroin and cocaine, its as little as a few weeks/ few months and with other substances like alcohol or weed (yes even weed you nunces) have longer threseholds, at the scale of years and for some people even decades of prolonged use before crossing the thresehold.

whatever your vice may be, if you abuse it heavily and sustained for long enough to develop withdrawals, you FUCKED UP buddy, the changes that occur in your brain arent simple ""dopamine-reward centre"" mechanics, your receptors become altered (not the best word, but neither is damage) and in general your brain chemistry is just changed, these changes are all irreversible. 

You're just as likely to relapse the day you quit as you are the day you die. The craving will always be there.

(sorry i dont remember any of the actual sciencey terms because i learned this from a lecture i watched two years ago when i was still addicted to all sorts of drugs, whoops)

so anyways, what does any of this mean for you, or for me? well it means we can drop your hopes of ever ""returning to normal"" or whatever other iteration of that you may say to yourself to get up in the morning only to disappoint yourself when you dont feel normal. There is no ""going back"" youve crossed the river and sank your raft. Your stuck on the other side with all of us other addicts, your friends and family and all the other people who used in moderation or not at all, they all have their rafts. Thats why they can use substances and not be depressed or craving when they dont have it. For us, every time we arent on our drug of choice, all we can think about is how we can get back to the other side of this metaphorical river to join our friends and family in their happiness and normaility. 

so yeah we fucked up bruh, big time too, but that doesnt mean you should give up, or whatever. Every day you wake up is a gift, and every day you spend sober is a mircale, enjoy every moment before its all taken away, by death, or relapse. Theres no reward for doing it all either. For many of us, no one will congratulate us on our return home from rehab, or recognize our changes in behaviour. Often times we will forever be branded as a ""junkie"" by our family or friends and theyll fail to see you as other wise. Some people wont forgive you despite your changes, and often times it will just seem like theres no reason at all to stay sober. but trust me. Youll regret taking for granted, the freedom that is sobriety.. Because trust me, we are all better off sober, even if it seems like the world is working aginst you in every way because of it, 

so yeah, theres a reason mfs sy ""take it one day at a time"", hope this comforts someone. Keep it up dude, drink coffee, atleast if youre hooked on coffee you can be a normal fucking functioning member of society or something lol.

PS; if youre wondering why i put harm reduction, my intention with this post is to rid anyone of their false expectations of normaility after addiction. Many of my friends, and my self have relapsed because we have been longing for that return to normal life that never came. So we just went back to what felt better, since neither seemed to be more beneficial over the other besides emotionally.

So I didnt realize how bad it was/is when I first did it. When I was a kid I used benadryl to help me sleep. Like I went through a 600 pill bottle over the course of half a year to a year. I think I was taking 2 to 6 pills every night. This was when I was 18-19 and didnt think benadryl is bad for you so I did no research on it 

It was just over the counter drugs right? NBD, how bad could they be? Helped with my insomnia, helped with my allergies (live in an area with crazy high pollen records) 

I got put on antidepressants when I was 19, and that helped with my insomnia so no more benadryl... till now anyways. 

Ran out of antis after a few months when I was 19 and didnt get a refill, but still didnt pick up benadryl. 

Well. I got progressively stupider as I got older. I know you always hear about the damage drugs can do, and people tell their stories all the time. Posting warnings and telling their stories, hoping it helps someone and keeps them safe. 

I rolled near the beginning of quarantine. Did acid a few times. Only waited about 9 to 10 weeks to roll again, and candyflipped when I did it. 

I dont need to be told how stupid I am. I know I am. I see all the signs of how Ive destroyed myself. I know. I need no outside forces telling me how dumb I am. 

I just need to know how to get better, and how not get addicted to benadryl again. Because fuck its what Ive been using to get high again (not to trip, I dont want to see the scary monsters people always talk about) and Im starting to lose it. Please help me.

I taged ""GABAergics"" since I've red somewhere that pregabalin is indirectly modulating the GABA system, don't know if that's true though.

After I let out the second hit, the world began turning crazy as fuck, I got this feeling like my whole reality got split into portions parallel to where I was looking, and I thought only my middle portion was working right then (and if I moved, I'd break away from my arms, legs, shoulders, etc which are in a separate portion of my visual reality). This continued on uncomfortably. I tried closing my eyes and thinking 'penguin dance party. Remember, you're the popular penguin,' to try to induce the last salvia experience I had with my eyes closed (only 20x though) which was really enjoyable {Basically that time, I salvia dreamt I was the cool penguin at a dance party on the iceburgs and I busted it down like crazy, then I nicely transitioned from the party to my home igloo by sliding down this ice ramp/jump. Then I came home to my kids, looked at my wife, said ""everything's fading away"" with a smile, as I began to slowly recall my existence as Jaxon the Human on earth smoking salvia, and I whispered in my head to the wife of my fading salvia penguin reality ""Honey, how does a penguin build his house?,"" And with a tear in my eye.... ""Igloos it together"". I questioned my sanity after that experience, but overall a fun one}...

Okay back to the current story lol, I closed my eyes and remember just being disgusted with how boring the back of my eyelids looked. So dark and no rainbow light visuals swirling around them all day. I still felt that my reality was split into the portions, but I felt slightly safer in the comfort of the darkness from my eyelids. As the music on my playlist changed after about a minute of disgust and confusion, the song came on by Marhsmello - Be kind. The lyrics/message of the song are basically ""be kind to and confide in the one that you love"", and I got really emotional because the salvia craziness began wearing off and I felt in control of my legs and arms and whole body again, as I imagined the lyrics (the girl singing) was the weed pulling me back to an actually chill time. The salvia was rapidly losing its effect on me, as I looked at my bag of salvia next to my bag of weed and just loving the weed so much, ready to shmoke a nice hit of plain old buddha and put the salvia away until another adventure. 

Fuck that shit man, its crazy like DMT but at least DMT felt orgasmically euphoric in the process of beam raping my entire identity in order to show me my greatest flaws as a person.

In college my family ended up going on vacation to an all-inclusive resort with a bunch of other families in our neighborhood (including one of my close friends' family). To give some context, our parents as well as all the other parents in the group are conservative Asian parents who HATE drugs. I was still pretty new to drugs at the time, only having smoked weed several times and tripped once. 

Anyways once we got to the resort, being college kids and all, we all proceeded to get absolutely hammered into oblivion. We were drinking nonstop and already starting to embarrass ourselves in front of our parents (to their dismay). On the third day, my buddy whispered for me to come to his room and took me to his balcony. On the table were several lines of coke! I asked him where the hell he got that and he said he bought it from a ""trinket seller"" (aka drug dealer) on the beach. 

Even though I had never done coke ever in my life before (and at the time I was VERY against trying it), I was really drunk and thought ""fuck it"". So I took a few lines and was super pumped up. After we finished we went to the beach and ran into our parents along the way. It freaked me out for a second but they didn't think anything of it luckily.

List of chemicals and materials: 
Diluted HCl - also called Muriatic acid - can be obtained from hardware stores, in the pool section

NaOH - also called lye

Ethyl Ether - aka Diethyl Ether - Et-0-Et - can be obtained from engine starting fluid, usually from a large supermarket. Look for one that says ""high ethyl ether content"", such as Prestone

Ephedrine The cottons in todays vicks nasle inhalers dont contain efed or pfed (ephedrin or psuedoephedrin) but there are still lots of easy ways to get good ephed or pfed, pure ephedrin can be extracted out of it's plant matter, from a plant that can be bought at most garden stores. Or you can get pfed from decongestive pills like sudafed. Most people perfer to work with pfed from pills rather then ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will fuck up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced shit or under-reduced shit. Or contaminats will jell durring baseifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the lable on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you dont want and will remove when cleaning your pills. but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You dont want pills with a red coating, you dont want pills with alot of cellose in them and you dont want pills with much wax. you also dont want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed hcl then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients, time released pills are usualy harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to gel up durring the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed hcl as the only active ingredient. You first have to make ephedrine (which is sometimes sold as meth by itself):If you are selling it...I would just make ephedrine and say it's meth.

Distilled water - it's really cheap, so you have no reason to use the nasty stuff from the tap. Do things right.


List of equipment : 
A glass eyedropper 

Three small glass bottles with lids (approx. 3 oz., but not important)one should be marked at 1.5oz, use tape on the outside to mark it (you might want to label it as ether). One should be clear (and it can't be the marked one).

A Pyrex dish (the meatloaf one is suggested) 

A glass quart jar 

Sharp scissors

Clean rubber gloves

Coffee filters

A measuring cup

Measuring spoons 


Preparing your Lab:

Preparing Ethyl Ether:
WARNING: Ethyl Ether is very flammable and is heavier than air. Do not use ethyl ether near flame or non-sparkless motors. It is also an anaesthetic and can cause respiratory collapse if you inhale too much.

Take the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it looks half-full. Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake for 5 minutes. Let it sit for a minute or two, and tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, draw off the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, and throw away the lower (water) and cloudy layer. Place the ether in the marked container. Repeat this until you have about 1.5 oz. of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand.

Ethyl ether is very pungent. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable. 

Ephedrine &amp; or P-Ephedrine: Please discuss this on the neonjoint forum 

5. Pour 1/8 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate. Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so.

6. Fill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible. This will cause the free base to dissolve into the ether (it -is- soluble in ether). 

7. Let the mixture settle. There will be a middle layer that is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible. This is why this bottle should be clear. 

8. Remove the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of the middle layer in it. Place the removed ether layer into a third bottle.

9. Add to the third bottle enough water to fill it half-way and about 5 drops of muriatic acid. Cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away. The free base has now been bonded to the HCl again, forming a water soluble salt. This time, we're getting rid of ether-soluble impurities. Make sure to get rid of all the ether before going to step 11! 

10. If there is anything left from step 3, repeat the procedure with it. 

11. Evaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat. You can do this on the stove or nuke it in the microwave (be careful of splashing), but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be ephedrine HCl.

If you microwave it, I suggest no more than 5-10s at one time. If it starts ""popping"", that means you have too little liquid left to microwave. You can put it under a bright (100W) lamp instead. Microwaving can result in uneven heating, anyway.

First Batch: 120mg ephedrine HClEstimated: 300mg (100% of theoretical, disregarding HCl)

Now, Making Methamphetamine out of ephedrine by reducing it with Hydroiodic Acid and Red Phosphorus.

Items needed:
Alot of matchbooks (the kind with the striking pad)

Coffee filters (or filter paper)

Something that measures ml and grams

A flask (a small pot with a lid can be used)

iodine

Hydroiodic Acid (I will tell you how to make this)

Red Phosphorus (I will tell you how to make this)

Lye

*Optional (toluene and HCI gas) 


Making Red Phosphorus:
The striking pad on books of matches is about 50% red phosphorus. The determined experimenter could obtain a pile of red phosphorus by scraping off the striking pads of matchbooks with a sharp knife. A typical composition of the striking pad is about 50% red phosphorus, along with about 30% antimony sulfide, and lesser amounts of glue, iron oxide, MnO2, and glass powder. I don't think these contaminants will seriously interfere with the reaction. Naturally, it is a tedious process to get large amounts of red phosphorus by scraping the striking pads off matchbooks, but who cares?

Making Hydroiodic Acid:
This is made by mixing iodine and red phosphorus. When making hydroiodic acid from iodine and red phosphorus, the acid is prepared first, and allowed to come to complete reaction for 20 minutes before adding the ephedrine to it. The way around the roadblock here is to just boil off some more of the water from the ephedrine extract, and make the acid mixture in fresh pure water. Since the production of HI from iodine and red phosphorus gives off a good deal of heat, it is wise to chill the mixture in ice, and slowly add the iodine crystals to the red phosphorus-water mixture. 

Now, Making Methamphetamine:
To do the reaction, a 1000 ml round bottom flask is filled with 150 grams of ephedrine. Also added to the flask are 40 grams of red phosphorus and 340 ml of 47% hydroiodic acid. This same acid and red phosphorus mixture can be prepared from adding 150 grams of iodine crystals to 150 grams of red phosphorus in 300 ml of water. This should produce the strong hydroiodic acid solution needed. Exactly how strong the acid needs to be, I can't say . With the ingredients mixed together in the flask, a condenser is attached to the flask, and the mixture is boiled for one day. This length of time is needed for best yields and highest octane numbers on the product. While it is cooking, the mixture is quite red and messy looking from the red phosphorus floating around in it.When one day of boiling under reflux is up, the flask is allowed to cool, then it is diluted with an equal volume of water. Next, the red phosphorus is filtered out. A series of doubled up coffee filters will work to get out all the red phosphorus, but real filter paper is better. The filtered solution should look a golden color. A red color may indicate that all the red phosphorus is not yet out. If so, it is filtered again. The filtered-out phosphorus can be saved for use in the next batch. If filtering does not remove the red color, there may be iodine floa

This happened over a year back, but it just came to mind so thought I'd ask. 

Me and a couple of friends got some Molly. We'd never done it before. We got 3 capsules for $60 and swallowed one each. 

Well it was an awful experience. It began with  friend number 1 (who has the most experience with drugs ) freaking out telling us he may need 911... he began sweating like crazy, his heart was beating extremely fast, and he had chest pains. At this point me and the other friend didn't feel anything. But we were trying our best to help him calm down. He kept telling us something wasn't right. And he felt like he was going to die.

I got up to get him some water and as soon as I got to the sink it hit me. My heart was racing so fast, and I began to get really hot. I looked over at him and he looked back at me and he knew it began effecting me too. I went straight to the bathroom and began taking some deep breathes. I came out of the bathroom and friend 2 who it hadnt hit yet came over to me and told me just to relax and go with it. We both immediately burst into laughter that we couldn't control. (This was the only fun part about it), lasted about 20 mins. 

Then horrible feelings came back and I felt like I was about to have a heart attack so I made it to the bed, concentrated on my breathing, and focused on getting through it. 

The next thing I remember is a huge bang, friend number 2 had collapsed on the floor. Friend 1 came into the bedroom carrying friend 2 and put her in the bed next to me. At this point I was just listening to what was going on around me, I couldnt physically get up, using any energy made me feel like I was going to have a heart attack.

Friend 2 then went completely insane, I mean she freaked the hell out. She got up and began falling all over the place, she kept screaming at the top of her lungs shouting about a black shadow man being in the room. She then called her dad who she hadn't spoken to since she was a child, and began saying how much she forgives him for being a shit dad, and then proceeded to call other family members crying, telling them she was about to die. 

Friend 1, who had calmed down took the phone away and explained the situation to the family, and told them he would take care of her. 

At some point I managed to get up and go and lay on the sofa (we were in an apartment complex and our door was directly next to the front entrance to the whole complex) whilst laying there I heard someone, answer the front entrance, and they were speaking to a police officer because apparently someone had called about screaming. 

I wasn't sure if I was hallucinating or not so I ran into the bedroom. Told them both to shut the hell up. Grabbed friend one, took him to the door and he could also hear the police. 

I took friend 2 into the bathroom, had her lay down in the bath and turn on the shower so it was cold and she could calm down and be quiet.

The police weren't sure which apartment it came from, friend 1 went out there and made quick small talk with the officer and basically told him that he also heard shouting from an upstairs apartment to throw him off the trail. 

After that I guess we had all calmed down and felt semi ok. We were just sat around talking when friend 2 pointed down the hallway and began freaking out saying there was a dark man. So friend 1 looked at then said 'holy shit', called me over, and when I looked there was a dark figure stood in the hallway. It was pretty freaky. I have never experienced that.

Then later on when we went to sleep, I was crashing in the bedroom and as clear as day there was a super tall shadow man on the wall, he had a top hat and was smoking a cigarette and walking along the wall that freaked me the hell out. 

It took me a while to get off to sleep that night. I was in bed sick for like 3 days afterwards.

I just got a vape cartridge for it and ironically enough, I was worried about doing too much of it my first time around since you can’t really accurately dose how much you’re doing from a pen and therefore may have too heavy of a trip but I clearly didn’t do enough because in total, I was only high for a few minutes max. I saw some colorful patterns on my ceiling and it warped around a little bit but honestly, I’ve had much stronger hallucinations on acid and all of this only lasted maybe three minutes in total so it wasn’t even the usual 5-15 minute high that DMT is supposed to give you. I really thought that the 6-8 puffs I took would be enough especially because of how big some of them were and how long I held them for but clearly, I didn’t do enough.

I'm less nervous about Kratom (don't plan to use it daily, obviously, because addiction potential and all) than stimulants because, for some reason, I feel as though Kratom wouldn't make me trip out whereas I have this weird idea that if I do stims and redose, I'll end up tripping. Yes, I know that stimulants aren't comparable to psychedelics, but somehow, I'm still more anxious about that.

**TL;DR:** Had a bad trip on synthetic noids months ago. Currently in antipsychotics withdrawal (Seroquel). The only symptom is strong CEVs at night.

Nothing will happen to legalize the standard drugs, they are what is keeping every economy in the world going, its all the big players who are white washing their drug money and pay tax on it, thats the only way they can keep the money, Pablo escobar was silly burying all his money, proper drug dealers are probably paying more tax than the 'proper' corporations who skip taxes where ever they can.

&amp;#x200B;

Dont forget, the police confiscate all the earnings/property from low level drug dealers, and use the money to pay for the police, we can not afford to pay for the police ourselves.

&amp;#x200B;

What about all the money that would disappear, if we did legalize drugs, then the price would drop substantially, and that would help destroy the local economy.

We all know its not the drug dealers who are forcing people to use drugs, its the drug users who force the dealers into selling to them :)

All drugs should be legal. Any time you prohibit something it just creates trouble. That trouble comes in the forum of gangs, cartels, murders ect. I would think the point of having drugs being illegal is that they are bad and if its illegal less people would use? In fact all it does is open up an underground market because suprise suprise you can not stop anyone from doing what they want to do. There will always be a way to get drugs so as a government why not use this as a chance to profit? Tax the fuck out of them and get your cut instead of letting all the money go to criminals. 

Here in the USA we could use that tax money and all the other money wasted on ""the war on drugs"" to do shit that actually helps slow drug use like proper drug education, government funded rehabilitation, and idk buy every recovering addict a fucking cookie and tell them they are doing great!

Another key reason to legalize drugs is there would be little to no overdoses. In a world where drugs are legal and you are a heroin addict you go to the store and buy some heroin. There's like no chance you will die off that bag because its the exact same heroin you have been buying and using for so long. You know exactly how much you can do and dont have to worry about it being cut with fentynal or benzos. 


My last point is while sharing this opinion with some people ive heard they wouldnt want drugs to be that accessible. My response to this is if you dont do the drug would you want to just because its available? Ofcourse not! Its available right now and you dont want it. Atleast if drugs were legal and regulated there would be a slight layer of protection from kids being able to get them but again everyone is going to do what they want and nobody can change that. 

Anyways theres my viewpoint, would love to hear yours.

Not entirely sure this is the right sub to post this in, but im a bit nervy as you may expect from the title.

Long story short a guy at work got wrongly arrested (caused a big scene at work, 10 police officers turned up and searched his locker where they found some cannabis) turns out his number plate was cloned and then they later said it wasnt cannabis, probably doing him a favour for potentially costing him his job. 

I work in management so i we were discussing drug testing him, but due to the circumstances and him potentially suing for unjust dismissal and such, they plan on testing everyone.

I used to smoke frequently before i got this job, but have been fully clean since august 2019, however, i very stupidly had a 3 (small) drags/tokes/pufs on my friends joint 16 days ago.

This has been misconstrued as if prisons are being emptied out, but the truth is that the only ones going home should have already been there. The parole board notoriously uses any pretext to extend a sentence, so a good chunk of the population are doing 12 or 24 month flops for either breaking one of the million rules of parole or not completing their programming (even if it’s through no fault of their own), or other minor violations.

I was one of those considered eligible, so I was notified a few weeks ago that I was being called back early to see the board, whom I wasn’t supposed to see again until November, or until after my case was resolved, whichever came first. The interview was set for today.

On Monday, I received the NFD, or non-fixed date, in the mail, meaning: a parole within the next 30 days, if not sooner. Due to the pandemic, guys were going home 2-3 weeks after getting the NFD. On my paperwork, my release date was listed for the following Monday. I know that sounded too good, too soon, too much like justice for it to be true, and, accordingly, I should regard it cool and skeptically.

But I couldn’t refrain from thinking about or hoping that this was gonna happen. I pondered all the explanations for this serendipitous change of events. Perhaps, the Department of Corrections amended their policy amidst this crisis. After all, they’re now letting inmates complete programming classes in the world. If my circumstances are essentially unchanged from 6 months ago…why would they call me back early, if not to parole me because of a policy change? Everybody else the board called back was nearly guaranteed to be headed home soon. Moreover, why even give me a NFD under the door (i.e. getting a parole without having to see the board first) unless it was the real deal? The NFD is considered the best decision you can receive. What were serious concerns then may not seem so in these calamitous times.

Plus, the parole board can’t be that incompetent; it wouldn’t play with someone’s emotions so capriciously. After all, this is my life, my freedom. I’d be transferred into the custody of the county jail, and since my bond is only $500 on that case, I’d be able to post that immediately, assuming the county still wanted to come get me….and I’d heard county jails were granting PR bonds to anyone fighting a case. I deconstructed the scenario from every angle, considered the possible thinking behind this decision, and came to the only sensible conclusion: I was actually gonna go home soon, hopefully Monday.

For the first time in years, I let myself imagine being freed in the immediate future. Fuck it, I didn’t even care if everything was shut down. I just wanted to come home. I daydreamed about drinking an actual beer. I fantasized about getting some pussy. I’d come home and immediately reach out to all viable partners…”look, I just got out of the joint and I’m probably going back for another, even longer, sentence. I wanna fuck like savages for my last few months of freedom and make the memories I’ll jerk off to for the next 4-5 years.” Sure it sounded desperate but it was direct, self-assured. Plus, I’d have that fresh-from-prison glow, and a lean, muscular physique, so that explicit appeal could actually attract a handful of girls. I’d hunker down and smash out for the summer. Hopefully I’d manage to sleep with one of those girls I’ve always wanted but never had, before she got too old or married.

I’d lock down some extra support, and make the preparations when you know you’re headed to prison. I’d be able to say goodbye to all my friends and family that I wasn’t able to when I caught this first case. Have a proper sendoff, like a party, a day or two before sentencing. Get so loaded that sentencing would be a blur, and only regain my faculties after a few days in quarantine.

The only thing that could fuck it up is if my court date got moved up and held over a video conference. But that’s a hurdle that could be handled…and then when I got out, my sentencing could be delayed even further. Possibly, I could have one full, wild, intoxicating summer, the last one of my youth. When I leave prison after this new bit , I’ll be middle-aged (30 something), hopefully with my best years still ahead of me.

While lost in these reveries, I’m also watching Xena: Warrior Princess. There’s a marathon on and the show is surprisingly entertaining,(and cheesy) with the loudest, most overdone sound effects. Lucy Lawless is such a fucking babe (with an amazing name). I debate how much she approximates my perfect woman or not. Dark, almost black, hair with blue or green eyes is like heroin for my boner, and her body, that white girl thickness, is the ideal, and, as showcased in that scanty armor, has the same effect as mainlining Viagra would have. I try to think about girls I know that resemble her, and come up with one or two. Okay, I vow, I’m gonna reach out to her in my first days out.

Suddenly, the CO announces over the loudspeaker: “22, Mccaffery, bunk 22, report!” I walk to the officer’s station, wondering why I’m being called. Usually it’s because I’ve books to pick up.

“yeah, McCaffery, sorry man your parole has been suspended for a pending charge.” And, as much as I expected this and tried to stay detached, I’m still devastated. Just the prospect of parole had me giddy, and the remote possibility of hooking up with a female this summer excited me endlessly the past couple days. That pent-up energy now discomfits and discourages. I feel like I’m charlie brown trying to kick a football and the parole board is Lucy, yanking it away at the last second.

Even worse, an hour later I’m called to the desk again, and the counselor hands me my parole paperwork. 15 months, few stipulations, 11 pm curfew. That’s all moot. Usually, people savor the yellow paper of the 30 day notice, signaling an upcoming parole board interview. It means the end is near. And when most guys get their parole paperwork, with the decision and stipulations, the reality of reentering society sets in, and their behavior changes. These are literally the best pieces of mail one can get. Unfortunately, they’ve become meaningless to me, or worse. I’ve a stack of both because of how many times I’ve been granted a parole only to have it suspended, so these have become shitty mementos of how close I was and how far I am from reaching the end of this ordeal.

I feel so let down, confronting the fact I probably won’t make those plans for a few more years. I do what I can to distract myself from more bad news, and gradually ease back into the penitentiary mindset: breathing exercises, push-ups, TV…relaxing bit by bit, content for the present, hoping for a future, still dreaming Xena.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,686382,public,confidence,self,Another blog post from my brother in prison titled... “Great Expectations”,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/ha6e68/another_blog_post_from_my_brother_in_prison/,no_ads,0.0,1592350830.0,Custom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Does anyone know   


1) How dangerous if is to one's liver (or in other ways to the body) to ingest GBH that has been created from Industrial GBL?  The ph stayed too blue as compared to the result made from pharmaceutical GBL.   


\*\*\*OR\*\*\*    


2) Does anyone know a way for non-chemists to clean it more thoroughly/ get the ph more where it should be when made from industrial GBL?  

\-it has been suggested that the ph problem is due to the GBL being poor quality

\- unfeasible to use pharmaceutical now with current situation

\- not connected with chemists , contacts or folks ""in the know"" - that's why we need to ask for help here. Strictly personal, occasional use- 2 x/mo.

 \- process used involves heating on stove top very slowly without contact with metal, and slowly adding baking soda and distilled water.   Added lots of vinegar but it never got the ph where it should have been. Process takes  1/2 hour. This process was always successful with pharmaceutical GBL.

&amp;#x200B;

It has been suggested to simply process longer, like an hour or more, until ph goes down. Haven't tried this yet. Opinions?

Does anyone know a way to remove impurities from and/or lower the ph of the resulting GHB batch that a non-chemist could handle?

I am getting help from a psychiatrist after I admitted my cocaine addiction (recreational abuse, more or less 1g every other evening) and he gave me the Ritalin to help me fight against the craving for the cocaine high that used to make me feel intensely strong, focused, chatty, sexy, confident and HAPPY (well, happy snorting one line every 30 minutes, otherwise horribly apathic/depressed/anxious after the last line when I had to go to sleep and used xanax in order not to feel that bad). 

The problem is: Ritalin isn't, in my opinion, anything like cocaine, nonetheless many say it is! I take 30 mg during the day and YES, like coke it does get me more focused and alert BUT it lacks the effect I have always loved and cherished so much which is the euphoric happiness and confidence boost given from snorting (for instance: on coke as a woman you would and could likely have sex all night, which I def would not with ritalin at this dosage. Coke was in my opinion exceptional as a woman sexual performance drug).

Least but not last I have to say I was used to really top quality coke in matters of how pure it was (90% and plus costing me obviously a fortune but all my friends were astonished with its quality). So can it be that maybe Ritalin is comparable to cheap coke, lacking the marvellous A grade coke including pleasant euphoria, confidence, happiness, total lack of fatigue?
Or maybe probably in order to target those brain areas 30 mg of Ritalin is absolutely too low to expect these feelings?

I could barely stand up... I was afraid to stand up..m music made no sense but was orgasmic ajd gosh the freshness of the raaaain and his voice... But also paranoia... Lots.. of... Before remembering I ahd an umbrella and mustering courage to head home to mymparentss place where I just brushed teeth and fell into the bed at 21h!!! So glad I did not wait 6 more hors like usually bc I woke up at 7 for intense physical labor. It wqs heavy... Like... I couldnt make myself do anythjng but as it faded and as I realized I was rest... Gosh.. i flew!

But the way home from cafe... Every wet tile made a smelly sound penetrating my retina with its sharp and shiny but so audible reflection... It'd pop out and my legs would shoot through the clouds underneath... But also... It felt so real. Too real. Realer tham the actual reality. I was controlling a game character in third person. My thoughts were in third person... Or was it only sharper FOV in a first person game... Colors are so vibrant goooshh

This took place a few months ago before everything got shut down and I figured i would tell this story whenever I got a chance and well im currently procrastinating my work from home internship so why not.

So me and my friends are heavy into Dubstep and we went to go see probably one of my favorite producers, Liquid Stranger. It was a concert during the middle of the week but I sort of have a weird thing were i first saw him when i was tripping at a festival and wanted to continue the streak. I dropped a tab of acid around 7pm and with my roommate who took molly and brought a dmt vape pen waited for our friends that were gonna do just a little K for the concert. So we all get to the venue and this is actually the first time ive ever been to the Roxian near Pittsburgh. I didn’t know at first but the venue is notorious for kicking people out but we’ll get to that in a minute.

The place is built in such a trippy way also. It has 2 floors and a basement and the floor stairs are separated by doors. Of course im tripping so im just exploring the whole place and having epiphanies left and right. There was one point I had gum in my pocket didn’t realize it and when i felt it and pulled it out it blew my mind. Its funny that acid blows your mind with the simplest things but anyway. I was going to school about a 45 minute drive outside of Pittsburgh so I ran into a few friends and even made some new friends w this guy who recognized me from town. But soon thats when things started to turn south.

So the headliner has been on for about idk maybe 30 minutes now. I was on the balcony and my friend that took the molly never went up to see what the balcony looked like at all. All of a sudden i get calls and text messages “dude they just kicked me out fuck fuck i need you to come help me”. I start thinking to myself “what the fuck this can’t be real” and this feeling of dread just washes over me. Meanwhile i get our other friends that we were with to meet down in the lobby to try figuring out what a game plan needed to be. I meet the guy who got kicked out at the smoking spot outside and he says hes gonna hand me his stuff and hes going to try jumping back into the smokers area. I currently have no words for this. But as soon as he started handing me stuff thats when the staff said “no you have to go, leave, 100ft from the property” so after i sent him a text saying “yeah I don’t think I would’ve been able to help there.” By this time my sober friends came down to the lobby and one agreed to go to the car with the one that got kicked out since it was cold and raining outside.

So the concert wraps up and I didn’t enjoy it as much as i wanted to because of what happened. So finally We get to the million dollar question of why did my friend get thrown out? We he was on the main concert venue floor and hit his dmt pen on the stairs and wasn’t getting up. A security guy asked him to get up and he didn’t comply so they just figured he got too fucked up and threw him out. Funny enough he probably could have gotten away with it if he was up in the balcony where there’s seats. Needless to say i was pissed at him for a bit because of having to deal with that while tripping. I had this thought going through my head like “why fucking me why the fuck do i have to pick up everyone elses shit and fix THEIR problems.” But i also realized that for as bad and angry i was at my friend, he was probably feeling even worse at that time. We’ve both made up for it and honestly hes a good guy and actually smart with drugs since he did some dealing. He was just stupid about how he did what he did and could have done it differently. 

But yeah the ride home was great and we talked about how we all felt and he had some extra K so he gave me a lil bump and when we got back to my house he smoked me up w some dabs and i copped some etizolam to help me sleep. All in all it was still a good night. That night showed me how far I’ve come from a psychedelic point from having a challenging first trip with lsd to being able to handle this. I ended up appreciating Liquid strangers music even more after this.

So I asked him exactly when and he said during 6th grade and that starting that young was completely normal for everyone from his neighborhood. He also mentioned that by 8th grade he was drinking near daily and that he couldn't get through a day of high school without booze. 

This just blew my fucking mind even as someone who has experimented with around a dozen different drugs. When I was in 6th grade I had no idea what weed actually was and the only time I heard about it was when some 8th graders got expelled because they were busted with it. Not to mention how tf are you supposed to learn when you are that deep into drugs. High school structure is far more rigid than college where you can have off days and skipping class can be made up if you fucked up and need to miss a day. Due mostly to overbearing parents who drug tested me after my sister got caught with weed I didn't drink until the summer after I graduated high school and my first time getting high was taking and edible in my dorm room. Since then I have certainly experimented a lot, but I think starting later really helped it not be just a normal part of life that I relied on and instead something that was really fun.

I just couldn't stop thinking about how different my life would be in a likely negative way if I had been exposed to drugs at such a young age so I started asking other friends when they started and almost all of them who are reliant on drugs or worse started at age 14 or younger. These are my friends that will go to the dumbest lengths to get high, and don't get me wrong I love getting fucked up. But if its inconvenient I'd rather not and it kinda ruins the high for me, but they just can't go a day without smoking pot. I'm really glad that I waited until college to start experimenting since it hasn't been entirely smooth sailing for me, and I can only imagine the impact this shit would have on an even younger mind especially if i was in middle school. You are in no way ready to deal with drugs at that age and I feel like starting that young usually puts you on a bad path.

Could be kinda long though. TLDR at the bottom

I suffer from Anxiety and Depression for a few years. I go visit my therapist reguarly. When I turned 18, I decided to accept his offer to see a psychiatrist and get medication. At the time the pain I was in often made me go into an uncontrolable state in which I often hurt myself. On a sidenote, Drug use was at a bare minimum at the time. Smoking Pot every few months but that was it

So I went to see this doctor. Was pretty weird. He asked me a few questions but we didn't go into much detail. At the end he gave me a Prescription for Lorazepam 0,5mg for when I feel strong anxiety and Mirtazapin 7,5mg (End dose should be 30mg) before sleep. The very next day I went to the pharmacy before school and got the pills. The lorazepam was bliss and made the pain go away in an instant, I would use it every few days or so, nothing to crazy.

The Mirtazapin on the otherhand was uncomfortable as heck. It was the weekend, the days after I first took these pills, I was an unusable wreck. I was sleepy and couldn't move, felt like I was drunk all the time (I weighed 55Kg at the time, so pretty underweight for a 180cm guy). Put me to sleep everyday without fail though. Called my Psychiatrist and he said that can happen and I should just keep taking it. After 1 1/2 week he said I shoul increase my dose to 15mg. This is where the story gets fucked up.

First of all, my appetite went through the roof. Which was intended. In 1 month i would gain 5kg. But that was the only positive thing. Suddenly my perception became very strange. When I would lie down I would feel like gravity was changing all the time, like my bed would be turning spinning and so on. I also started to hallucinate. The walls started breathing and objects started to move wildly. When I would close my eyes it wouldn't stop. I didn't see darkness when I closed my eyes, but random pictures of things that flickered, which didn't help with sleep. When it got dark, shit hit the fan. I would see my room transform into different locations. I would lie in bed and suddenly I saw Plants and trees, the Walls where covered in Zebra like shadows and the shadows would reach out and form hands that would grab me. All the while I had no sense of gravity, I felt like I was on a ship. 

I told this my psychiatris, and.. he didnt believe me. He kept on insisting I should increase the dosage. The reason why I wanted meds, was because I couldn't go to school. But because of the Mirtazapin I was unable to get up in the morning, let alone concentrate on school. Was hard to anything when the Blackboard keeps running away and letters keep on flying around. This made me more depressed than ever. I felt as if this was it, I tried everything and now I am a lunatic who sees shit and is treated by his psychiatrist like a crazy person. I kept increasing my dosage, because I was helpless and desperate, I kept on telling myself ""this will pass, the doctor will know whats best for me"". But things kept getting worse and worse. Suicidal thoughts occured. I was so depressed that I started abusing the lorazepam, which didn't help. After I realised that I destroy myself I asked if I could go to a mental hospital.

Once I was there I tapered down the lorazepam and the Mirtazapin. I couldnt sleep for a whole week. I think I had 4 hours of sleep in 7 days. There where points in which i had to take 6 different pills a day. The hallucinations didn't stop. Turns out I also show symptoms of schizophrenia. After 6 weeks in the hospital, I was ready to leave. They gave me documents where they wrote down their diagnosis:

Moderate Depression, Anxiety, Signs of Schizophrenia and PSYCHOSIS DUE TO MIRTAZAPIN. I can't make this shit up, this fucking medication and this stupid psychiatrist ruined my life. Half a year later and I am still recovering from this traumatizing experience.

If your tryna buy like 2g’s and expect the plug to pull up then your an idiot. 

But yesterday I was literally trying to buy $100 worth of bars without a car. And, spoiler alert, I still don’t have any fucking bars. I tried like 3 different drug dealers and let them up charge the fuck out of me and they were all just like nah I don’t wanna deliver sorry (they all live less than 20 min away). One girl was like oh yeah I’ll do that I’ll get it tonight and bring it to you tomorrow, $10 a bar.  $10 a bar is a fucking scam, especially considering they’re probably presses, but it was like my only option so I was like ok fine. I woke up this morning and asked what time she’s free to pull up and this bitch just goes “oh sorry I forgot last night I can *try* to get it tonight”. Call me a fucking bar tard or an addict or whatever you want idc. I’m pissed as fuck. 

She literally would have made most likely close to $80 from this deal. To drive maybe 30 minutes total. That’s it. And she just didn’t do it. It’s a simple exchange. You get drugs for addicts and make easy money, and they get to have a good time with the drugs. But it’s like dealers don’t want your fucking money.

Man made- LSD, 2CB, 4-HO-MET, Ganesha

Natural- DMT, Shrooms, Syrian rue, Aya, Mescaline, LSA

I would put this as a draw or down to personal preference with both having man made and natural having very complex and intense substances

Dissociative’s

Man made- Ketamine, MXE, PCP, DXM, Nitrus Oxide

Natural- ???

Man made is superior here with no natural dissos that i can think of, very interesting...

Deliriant’s:

Man made- Benadryl, Procyclidine, Biperidn, Benzydamine

Natural- Datura, Amantia muscaria, salvia 

I think both man made and natural are not worth it but I hear Procylidine is quite euphoric, although I hear Amantia Muscaria can be interesting I’m still going to go with man made

Opioids:

Man made- Heroin, OxyContin, morphine

Natural- Opium, Kratom

It appears that while being stronger man made is a lot more dangerous and addictive, so in my opinion natural is better

Stimulants: 

Man made- Methamphetamine, speed, adderall, MDMA, MDA, cocaine, crack cocaine, caffeine 

Natural- Khat 

I’m sure I’m missing tons of natural but I believe them all to be fairly mild and cannot rival man made

Cannabinoids

Man made- 2k spice, JWH-014, AM2201

Natural- THC, CBD

Although I hear early synthetic cannabinoids weren’t too bad it’s a landslide victory for THC, there’s a strain for everyone...

Overall neither man made or natural is inherently better or safer but I personally prefer natural even if it’s just a placebo that they often give me a “cleaner” high

I first smoked weed alone to see what's its like at 16. Technically I bought it to try with a girl I liked then, but made the executive decision to pre-roll the day before and ""what the heck, might as well try"".

Couple years later I candy flipped alone, BTW I got the idea from psychedsubstance, and it was one of the best experiences in my life.

I have tried 24 drugs to date, and 20 of those I was the sole explorer. I have of course done drugs with people over the years, but for the first time it's almost always alone.

Let me explain the situation. I was a heavy weed user for 8 years, I used a lot of amphetamines (speed, md...) and did coke 4 times a week working as a barkeeper. 

Then, two months ago, I had the chance to test LSD for the first time. The setting was perfect, with friends, a reasonable dose (150um), a few joints and good music. 

The trip was really great, quite introspective, some visuals, a lot of fun. I laughed a lot, thought a lot, enjoyed every bit of it.

The next day I felt extremely calm, good with myself, like I understood things I could never grasp before, it was an incredible feeling. 

Since then, I almost stopped smoking weed, I just don't feel like it anymore. But the best part is, I quit coke and amphetamines, in short I feel really better (realizng I was becoming an addict through that experience)! 

The result of that experience is that I realized, I wasn't interested in those drugs anymore. I realized I was addicted and it did more harm than good to me, and I realized I should concentrate more on other things in life, like writing or playing music.

I wanted to share this feeling, and I hope that in the future the power of LSD will be recognized as a substance to make people aware of feelings and suffering that surround us.

I use it 2 times a week and it’s a really pleasant high. The highlight of my week is me with my lean, watching bojack horseman for the millionth time. I’ll usually take about 200 mg of codeine and any amount of promethazine (never bothered to check). But yesterday I didn’t have any prometh so I decided to only use codeine, thinking it would be less fun. Instead of 200 I took 400 mg ( the maximum amount you should take is 240~360 depending on the site). I’m sure you get where this goes but the experience was sooooo much better. The promethazine usually makes you sleep so it kind of wastes the sedated high you feel on codeine. But without it, it’s like you’re about to fade away or something. Felt so warm and comfortable and awesome. Love it.
Just to say if you do lean, maybe try higher doses of codeine and lose the prometh.

I tried to make pauses and not take it or take less but every time this lead to me sitting like a zombie in my chair, not able to do anything. Absolutely killing in my job.

Hey, Hi and Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

I have a specific question and I was unable to find information on this in /r/Drugs/wiki/drugs .

The question is - whenever I would take amphetamines, cocaine, MDMA or other stimulants/party drugs, I would get an effect that always confused me. 

If and when, I would take these drugs in a social setting, the effect they had on me was always different from that of my peers. It would almost seem that the world around me would speed up (friends became more talkative and energetic) whereas for me they would almost have a sedative effect. Of course, I would get wired and my thoughts would race and become more ''intense''(hope that's the right word to use) but at the same time, I always felt like I could just lie down in bed and fall asleep. And the more of the drug I took the stronger that effect would be (Mr Obviously Obvious)

To put it in other words, my head would go into overdrive, but my hands and legs would become heavy, my heart would beat harder etc. It's pretty counterintuitive in a sense and hard to explain.

Due to this I have not taken those drugs often and given them up altogether eventually. And if I did end up taking them after months of abstinence it would only remind me of why I had stopped taking them in the first place. Another thing probably worth pointing out is that I would always get this weird and intense 'hunger' sensation just underneath my sternum. 

I am asking this as I will be having a psychiatric evaluation in a week, and I've read that people with ADHD (whether you think it's real or not) usually get a sedative effect from stimulants like Adderall whereas other people sometimes abuse them since they're pretty much amphetamines ( correct me if I'm wrong) and I'm asking you guys because I'm a little worried about mentioning this to my doc but think this might be a hint as to what made me get an appointment in the first place.

Is it that I could possibly have ADHD (wouldn't be blown away by it) or maybe my heart doesn't do well on stims?

So the next test was on myself, I dropped 1 point of it and it didn't really hit me like mdma at all, there was no sudden intensity of it kickin in or anything like when I usually drop a cap

I do feel something like a little more aleart and wanting to do stuff but not like the usual feelings i get from mdma 


So basically I got ripped off over 1200 and im not sure what to do, should I throw it away? Should I still sell it as it still has a slight effect?
I really don't want to run at a lose of 1200 and if I could make some money back from the 7 grams I do have I would be happy but im not sure if selling weak mdma is the right thing to do, even tho its what I was sold

Having been homeless and FINALLY HAVING $2000 EVERY MONTH I can say one thing: there’s nothing I love more than my $2000!!!

It allows me to eat real food, not ramen and rice. It gives me a cheap studio apartment, not sleeping in my car. It allows me to go to a dispensary to get high.

And HELL YES I love money more than anything else in life!!! Who/what is there to love? My girlfriend? She doesn’t give me a roof over my head and a full belly every day, money does. My parents? Ever since I moved out they didn’t give me a roof over my head or a full belly every day, money does. Friends? Same thing, they don’t provide a roof over the head and food on the table.

I love money so much I’d be willing to kill both of my parents if I could get $100,000 (which means a cheap house (which means never again homeless)) out of it.

Think about it logically. A lot of money like a hundred grand or a quarter million can provide a permanent roof over my head and freedom from hunger for a long time. My parents do not. So what should I value more?

I had the mindset to get as fucked up as I could with no hesitation. I had a buddy that sold various drugs and was my average plug for a while. I wanted to get some tabs but he had didn't have any, although he had a few grams of coke.

I bought a gram of coke and did my first line in his car with some of his buddies and it didn't do as much as I expected even though I took a bump, and then a pretty fat line right after.

The next day I went through all of my coke except a little .2 rock that I planned to save for later. My buddy from a different town was coming through and had a few ativans and adderal. So I met up with him, I bought 3 adderal pills, and 5 Ativans off of him and headed home.

It came night and my parents headed to bed, so I popped all 5 Ativan and went to the bathroom to take a shower and looked at the ""adderal"" capsules and noticed they looked a bit different then what he normally sold me. On the orange capsule was written ""M. Amphetamine salts"". I'm not sure if this was meth or what not but my dumbass decided it didn't matter anyways

I chopped up 2 pretty big ass lines of the salts in the orange capsules, and immediately railed them. I hopped in the shower and right away I felt like superman. The ativan had kicked in and I felt the dizziness and tiredness, but the adderal countered it with an extreme stimulant effect. For some reason I can handle myself on basically anything with the exception of anything that makes me unable to see physical reality, so I just casually walked past my brothers, and back to my bedroom to smoke a few bowls.

My parents are pretty strict and do not allow me to smoke weed or do any sort of drug (not saying it's a bad thing), so I grabbed my DIY sploof and blew it into that. About 4 minutes after I got done smoking I remembered I had that little .2 rock and I rubbed it around in my mouth. About 5 minutes later I started to feel very weird. Everything turned black and white and my room started to look like a log cabin. I could hear noises that I knew were all in my head but sounded very real. My body was losing it's feeling and I would have to shake myself back into consciousness every once in a while because I would forgot that I existed. After I realized what I had done I just went right to sleep to get out of the bad high.

I was excited to have a gf so I said yes but it was very intense. After 1 week “I love you” was said and she had told me she had a history of meth and heroin use. Pretty sure she was on meth and heroin our first date... I just ended things cause I told her it was moving to fast and it turns out she was still doing heroin and lying. She didn’t take the break up well and cried and begged. Intense. 

Anyways not it’s a year later and we made up and agreed we had a good friendship. There was so FWB but we’ll agreed we didn’t want a relationship. So I had struggled with a benzo addiction and she was very helpful and wanted to help since she is “clean from heroin”


Sometimes she just stresses me out and she’ll get upset over little things and will say something hurtful. 
I’ve told her many times my health is number one and it she can’t respect that then she can’t be in my life. I also just a gut feeling, suspect she is still in heroin. 

She’ll fall asleep at odd times of the day or in the middle of a text. A few times she’s napped here she shakes like she’s having a full seizure. It’s scary :/ then I saw a text from her phone from one of the biggest heroin dealers around town and the once she sent me a location near field around her place with a message saying “I’ll meet you here”. She denied that that was a drug deal even tho she told me that’s where she would get meth all the time. And she claims that she didn’t know that this guy sold black but I swear before she said that she used to buy heroin from him. She denies she said that but I’m pretty sure I remember correctly. She was just soooo defensive and offended that I didn’t trust her that she was angry with me. She smokes it and I swear she can hardly breathe her lungs sound so fucked up :( she weazes every inhale

As far as interdose WD she also get sweats and shakes and just over all opioid sickness a few times like nausea. She’ll get randomly faint and feverish. She never eats ( though she’s a anorexic) and she take tramadol that she’s prescribed.

Here's the gist:

Acid: Had acid whilst camping over the weekend. Never had more than one tab in total over a day, but even with a little I enjoy the energy and how it makes me laugh and generally be more agreeable. 

So my partner and I took 1/8th of a tab and a few hours later another 1/8th. We had a good time, usual giggles etc. Then about four hours after the second dose, I suddenly felt ""weird"", lost my appetite and got jittery. It felt like when you have a lot of MDMA and you get tremors, so I took some  magnesium to try counter it early. About an hour later, went to bed with my partner and had full on head to toe shakes. I had another magnesium but they took about an hour or two to fully subside. No visuals, except the usual somewhat brighter colours and definition, but when I closed my eyes I had weird cartoon like ""dreams"" in a half-awake state. I get similar visuals with some types of weed.

Have never had that experience before with acid and wondering if anyone else has had tremors like that or knows why.

MDMA: Another example. I always would split caps in half or generally go easy on how much I took before taking more. Always enjoyed it, but generally it makes me quite lethargic, more likely to want to sit and chat and listen to music then go party. Everyone else I know wants to party all night, whereas I'm falling asleep on MDMA. 

Another eg with MDMA:  about a year ago at a festival, I took one whole pill, had the greatest high ever. No comedown, went home and slept it off, felt normal the next day. Two days later I was on the way home from work and I suddenly feel really weird, dizzy, like someone has thrown a bucket of ice water over my head.

Woke up yesterday and decided to go paddleboard the river with friends. Start off with a wake n bake, coffee, and pick up a 6 pack on the way to the river. We randomly ran into a group of other people on SUPs and we happened to know a couple, so next thing we know we're in a pretty large group. That's when my friend breaks out the shrooms. I started off with about 1.5 g and had a wonderful float.   


Afterwards we go back to my friends place to grill out and kick it. We eat another 4-5 g of shrooms over the course of a few hours, accompanied by tons of weed, dabs, whisky, and wine. After dinner we decide to eat even more shrooms. I start frying pretty hard and decided to dabble into some liquid L. In our trippy state we struggled to find a way to dose the liquid. We finally just say fuck it and drip some onto a piece of bread. This was just an open vial, no dropper on it. Needless to say I got a bit more than intended. My best guess would be that it was around 500-750ug (on top of \~6-7 g total of mushies).   


I felt it start taking hold within 15 minutes. I keep pounding booze and weed and just started jamming to some tunes. I spent most of the comeup just pacing my friends house and just staring at all of his artwork hanging up super closely and playing with his dogs. No one else partook in the sauce, so they passed out way before me. I don't remember a clear peak, but I know it was impossible that I got any sleep. Overall it was an amazing experience, although mostly unplanned.   


The only other time I've had a comparable trip was on shrooms, L, nitrous, DMT, booze, and THC. I honestly don't know if it's possible to trip any harder than I did last night. I feel like if I took anymore I would just straight up black out. It has been nearly 24 hours since I ate the L, roughly 32 hours since I started the shrooms and I still have some OEV's.

My 19-year-old son drinks and smokes marijuana. I am not really against the alcohol or pot, I drink and smoke too. We often drink and smoke together. The problem is he does it all day every day instead of being productive or looking for a real job. He does work online and earns enough to support his habit but not enough to rent. About $300 per month. I'd be willing to tolerate even that, but he also hates me very much over something that happened during his childhood (I am his dad and this is private, won't talk about it here). He holds a deep grudge and gets belligerent and confrontational all the time. Sometimes he gets violent.

Well recently there was a fight and I said he has to leave the house immediately, within 2 hours. He did pack his stuff and did agree to leave, but right before leaving he grabbed the $2500 cash I keep in my desk drawer. I told him he can have $100 and to put the rest back, and he flipped me off and left.

I might also add that he has a very low income ($300 per month) and almost no savings. I think around $500. So he would have been homeless if he didn't steal the money. And likely will either way, $3000 won't last long.

Also not sure if police can actually do anything, this is cash and he can always claim it is his. On top of that he does have some money himself. There's no record of me keeping it in the drawer.

Posting from a throwaway because, well, drugs.

Please help settle a disagreement and give some perspective and advice.

Someone I know got what he describes as ""liquid shrooms"".  Doing his own research he came to the conclusion that it is 4-aco-dmt, however the person he got it from is ""sure it is not 4-aco-dmt"" and says it's an ""alcohol-based tincture made from raw, not dry or oxidized mushrooms, which contains both psilocin and psilocybin as a result of the extraction process (as oxidized mushrooms contain little psilocin).""  Dealer's quote.

Tested it using Erlich which had a dark purple reaction, which doesn't really give any information either way.  (Unfortunately I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReagentTesting/comments/415is6/here_are_gcms_confirmed_reagent_results_for/) afterwards)  This means we aren't even 100% sure of what the substance is.

The ""liquid shrooms"" came in a small vial which was 3ml, which was supposed to have the same effects of ""1/8 of shrooms"".  It is a clear liquid without a strong taste.  A few weeks ago we both took around 1/3 of the vial each on an empty stomach.  Come up was around 30-40 minutes, peak was about 1.5-2 hours in, and by 4 hours we were completely sober.  I was surprised by the short overall length and how sober and functional we were afterwards.  The effects were mild, slightly psychadelic, not really empathogenic.

We wanted to try again with a slightly larger dose and add MDMA to the mix, and this is where we started to have disagreements.

The guy said that we should take the shrooms first and MDMA 30-40 minutes afterwards, because he ""read about hippyflips"".  He said that it's suggested to wait 1-1.5 hours to take the MDMA after mushrooms, but since we came up fast on the liquid shrooms last time we could cut it in half.

My disagreement was that yes, if we were taking actual mushrooms that timing would be correct, but since we are taking ""liquid shrooms"" we should reconsider the timing.  Knowing that the last trip was completely over after 4 hours, and knowing that the MDMA would last longer overall, I suggested we take them at the same time, or even take the MDMA beforehand.

His argument is that it's **always** recommended to take shrooms first, and that the liquid shrooms are ""the same"" and should be treated as the same as actual mushrooms.  ""It's the same thing after your body processes it, so the timing should be the same""

My argument is that the liquid shrooms are **NOT** the same as actual mushrooms and the timing should be reconsidered.  The effects are similar, yes, but the form and route of administration in the body is completely different.  We are either taking a chemical which has similar effects to mushrooms, or a liquid extract of mushrooms, both which are processed by the body in a completely different way than regular mushrooms and should be considered as such.

Every time I tried to correct him about the fact that ""these aren't the same as real shrooms"" he got upset.  ""If the end result is the same, it's the same thing, and the timing should be the same"" was his response.  In his mind, these ""liquid mushrooms"" and normal shrooms are exactly the same, with no difference in effect or administration.

So what do you think, /r/Drugs?  Does anybody have experience with ""liquid shrooms"" and what would your suggested timing be if trying to match the peaks of these with 100-150mg of MDMA?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,686210,public,confidence,self,"Please help settle an argument about ""liquid shrooms"" and MDMA",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/h9vd31/please_help_settle_an_argument_about_liquid/,no_ads,0.0,1592305893.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m going to try and make this quick and clear to understand. I’m a daily smoker, joints only - occasional cones. I struggle with anxiety and depression. I take t-breaks every now and then. 

Quick back story: Started smoking cones (age 17) stopped smoking cones because I started to wig out/pazz out skitz out. 

Some of my experiences: 

Nangs and bongs - screaming get out of my head, then to go on and wet myself in the middle of the sesh (18age)

Weed (bongs ) and alcohol- playing drinking game with friends, I thought everyone was ganging up on me to win. Playing rock, paper scissors. I could not win a fucking game. I kept losing, there was 4 people around the table. And I lost like 5 times in a row. So that just tipped the boat lmao. Wigged out for the whole wknd thinking everyone hates me, cooked shit. (19age) 

What happened yesterday is why I’m posting this. So yesterday I told myself when I woke up I won’t smoke a bong as I knew I was going to a friends house to study. I got to my mates house and for some reason, went straight for the bong. Literally the opposite of my intentions this morning . To be honest I rarely enjoy a bong, so me going up to it and packing a romper then smashing it down. I felt like I abused the bong, I put bad energy into and that’s what I got back. After the cone I realised, I just smoked when I said I didn’t want to. Throughout that day I was anxious and super self conscious of what I’m saying and doing. Later that day I was sitting on the floor and he was sitting on the couch. My mate says “ I’m having a bong” gets up from his seat (idk why, think he was getting some food or his phone) anyways after he got up I sat in his spot and then realised why the fuck did I sit there. Then my brain started running, and It came to the conclusion that I sat in his seat because he was having a bong. And I didn’t realise he can pick the bong up and I didn’t need to move from where I was sitting. Anyways I told my mate, he’s a sick cunt anyway so he asked if I was good and continued to play cod. Packed me a cone and we were allgoods. 

My fucking problem is. Why and How does this happen?!? If I am comfortable in the atmosphere nothing like this will happen. 

I kind of get this weird as fuck feeling that I know this shits gonna happen, I swear it’s got to do with the mood, energy I put into it. Or what’s currently on my mind and if it’s appropriate to smoke the bong. 

Also my uncle has skitz from abusing drugs mainly marijuana, however he was like 0.000001% off dying from a motorbike accident, survived it, smoked bongs everyday to feel normal.

I was prescribed the SNRI Cymbalta and Targin for a related injury that has persisted for years. The drugs definitely helped me live some sort of normalcy pain free. I also have severe sometimes deliberating fatigue, probably as a result of my body clock/sleep being messed up due to the injury, so have also been prescribed Modafinil. All in all these drugs did work for me and were safely prescribed, and all good to combine. But then a few months ago, I quite literately had what I believe was serotonin syndrome. Was on all three that day, accidentally took two of the SSNRIS without realising. My alcohol intake has gone up since this whole corona virus. i experienced severe head shakes/goosebumps, blood pressure was through the roof, I was so faint and dizzy. 

i freaked the hell out and decided to get off all medications, not in the correct way and my god I suffered the consequences of withdrawals. This was quite honestly horrific and I don’t wish it upon my worst enemy.  After 2 days of “cutting back” meds and then going cold turkey, symptoms began. Excessive night sweats to the point of needing to change my clothes twice, chills and then a fever, continuous head shakes/zaps, headaches so bad to the point that I could not walk or stare at a bright light without wanting to vomit, diaherra, and the worst of all - I experienced vivid auditory and visual hallucinations during REM sleep. i honestly thought I was going insane or developing schizophrenia. Ended up in the ER as a precaution and all tests were clear, so if anyone is experiencing the same withdrawal symptoms particularly from SNRIS and Oxycodone - yes, it is fucked up beyond words and no, you are not dying. You need constant support as it’s near impossible to go through it alone. And don’t do what I did, taper off slowly. 

So fast forward a few weeks later and finally I’m feeling back to normalcy. Some lingering symptoms but no way near as bad as those two weeks I endured. My question is - does this sound like a case of Serotonin Syndrome initially with having too many drugs in my system? If so It’s bizarre that I experienced having too much, to then withdrawing and having nothing. 

At the moment I am not going back on anything for a month or so until everything recovers. Probably just a cleaner SSRI given my anxiety and depression from this experience is horrible. Saying goodbye to pain medication. Obviously, I am not thinking of this at this moment, but I am spooked from all this  and I suppose I’d like to know if down the track drinking alcohol and cocaine use is going to fuck everything up again and I go back to these symptoms. I’m not really sure how the brain works and if I’m permanently altered or not, have read online and seen it usually takes months for things to go back to normal but of course, I want to be aware of any risks - I am quite a social butterfly who likes to party.

The last week has been a really a strange one because of the people I randomly hung out with. 

I discovered I actually vibed with this particular group, and hung out with them for four straight days.

In this time, I tried snorting, and smoking Meth. 

Now I’m at home, and I’m so depressed. Not because of the drug itself, but the fact that I thought it was an ok thing to do. 

It has completely changed the way I see the world, and I have been a shell of the person I was before I put that garbage into my body. 

I can’t be happy alone. All I do is feel hopeless, anxious, depressed, and cry. I lost all passion for anything. I can’t sleep properly, and have been taking Promethazine, alcohol, and weed to hopefully make me drowsy enough to pass out. I also miss my ex more now than I did right after we broke up. I feel so lonely. 

I tried to tell my best friend, but he said he would cut off our friendship if I was telling the truth, so I lied and said it was speed. 

I know this might sound dramatic to a lot of harder, veteren users, but I will never touch that disgusting substance again. 

I understand that it is heavily stigmatised, and that’s why the world sees it so grossly, but where do people think the stigma comes from? Why doesn’t MDMA, or LSD have the same stigma? Because neither of those substances have made me feel so desperate to have never tried them. 

I had easily the worst night of my life on shrooms when I was 17, and haven’t been able to do them since, and this trumps that a million to one. 

This was not me. At. All. I am not the kind of person that people would ever expect to have done that. It was on my list of 3 drugs that I would never try, and now that list has only 2 drugs on it. 

I’m terrified of myself, and what else I might do to myself. 

I have never regretted trying a drug before, and this feeling is awful. 

I think I need therapy or something. Luckily, my mum forced me to make an appointment for the GP a couple weeks ago, and I’m going to somebody who use to see my siblings and I when we where young, but I haven’t seen since, as he became increasingly popular. 

My drug use has come to a head now, and I think this is the beginning of the end of my drugs phase. 

I haven’t even really been bothered to hide my use from my parents anymore, and I’m 100% sure they know something is up, and are worried about me. Which is why mum made me book the appointment. 

I don’t really know why I feel the need to not only post here, but make a throw away account just to do so. Maybe it’s because I’m so ashamed of myself, but I also need to get this off my chest. 

If I had one piece of advice, it would be to take a step back and really take an honest look at what you are doing. Is it Meth? Probably don’t. 

I guess one positive things that this has brought up is it sort of forced me to take a step back and look at the bigger picture, which is something I hadn’t done before, because I never thought I had a problem. Yet, I couldn’t go 24 hours without a substance. (Not that I have since trying it.)

It’s like this experience, and the the last week have just suddenly turned the opaque glass clear, and I’m now seeing the reality of the path I might have been heading down.

This has made me fully re-evaluate my life choices, and the people I choose to hang around. You become the people you are with.

Sorry if this is just a jumble of nonsense, but I just wrote as my brain thought. I probably have more I want to write, but I don’t have the energy. I’m just going to go back to feeling hopelessly lost.

Most places are being completely unresponsive, or they reply and then ghost again.  I've PAID for these things, $1k plus at this point.  Packages either aren't being shipped, are getting held in the shipping country, or are held by customs here in the U.S.  This is ridiculous.  You'd think that customs here would at least be slightly more lenient or lazy since they are likely understaffed/overworked.  I've only once before had trouble actually receiving a package.  I was withdrawing from Tramadol  and thank god found Kratom which helped ease the symptoms and kind of forgot about Tram for now.

It started off with 1 50 count box, that worked so well I went back for 3 more boxes. I had some epiphanies about life but found I couldn’t remember them long. I then started using voice memos on my phone to record my epiphanies. I felt legit like a cyborg when I’d listen to myself on the recording, it felt like I was talking to myself and I liked it a lot. 

Day 2.
4 50 count boxes I ordered online arrived. At this point I’m experimenting with breath holding and ‘stacking’ nitrous into my lungs. I’m ‘fishing out’ as a result of this. I find that when I ‘fish out’ the rush is more intense, the wild part is as long as I fish on the couch its a fairly safe way to go into the void. I got to see what it looks like when I ‘fish’  by watching my security camera and it legit just looked like the life got sucked out of me. I buckle over at the waist like I’m on a hardcore nod and just bob there. Sometimes groaning, sometimes laughing. 

Day 3.
I’m all in at this point, I’m going to chase this as far as I can. I go to the shop and they just so happen to have a fresh case (12x50) of the fellas just sitting there. I feign to the guy at the counter like I’m feeling guilty for buying it, but I’m hella stoked. He puts the box on the counter and is like ‘oh shit’ when he picks it up, indicating that it’s heavy, it was. It was really fucking heavy. 600 whippers is a lot of metal lol. This is where I binged  for 10 hours and ran through 9 boxes. I was maintaining a real nice vibe, I’m convinced that while on nitrous I’m being shown that nothing is a coincidence. Like I’m seeing life’s true plan. Pretty sure Joe Rogan and Bill Burr are Illuminati. 

Day 4.
I’m not feeling all that ‘with it’ at this point. Kinda like a dulling of everything. I have some heavy duty bruises I have no idea how I got. I’ve ‘come to’ on the floor multiple times. It’s fairly apparent I’ve ‘seen’ everything nitrous has to offer, maybe I’ll experiment with mixing it with other stuff more regularly. I dabbed a lot of rosin during but it didn’t seem to enhance it at all, I was just doing nitrous while high. I have 4 more boxes that I quickly eat and when I finally crack the last little fella I’m relieved. It’s a chore inhaling pounds of gas. 

TL/DR:

There is no such thing as a coincidence.

Joe Rogan and Bill Burr are Illuminati.

17.5 lbs of gas is a lot to inhale.

Don’t do nitrous while standing or try to stand immediately after.

Basically I snorted the lines, was expecting the heart pounding euphora but it wasn't really there...which surprised me since it usually hits me right after the drip. And then I just felt....tired? Like maybe it was the xan from earlier suppressing the high but it was almost like I could fall asleep at any instant.

This was all in the span of a half hour and I ended up passing out directly after...which is great cause I regretted it as soon as I snorted thinking ""fuck...i'm commited for these next 12 hours and I've already exhausted my dopamine"".

Basically, my best friend has a Focalin XR prescription, and he has since he was about 5-6, after having troubles during preschool and kindergarten, he got diagnosed with ADD. 

Well, fast forward 10 years, and here we are abusing it together. It started off with him hooking me up with a 30mg XR whenever I had an important test or just generally a big day ahead of me in school. It was a once every month at the most thing.

I got the idea one day to try and use it recreationally, so I did some research and here’s the method I use when using Focalin recreationally:

1.) open the XR capsule(s), and pour the beads into a shot glass, then use a screwdriver to crush it, basically a ghetto mortar and pestle.

2.) Pour the “powder”(it’s usually half powder and half beads) onto a clipboard. Then I take my old school I’d, and put it on top of the powder/beads, and rub the top of it with the base of my pocket knife, to crush the remaining beads. I’ve found it’s much more enjoyable the more fine you can get it.

3.) then I usually parachute roughly 30%-40% of the total focalin, and snort the rest throughout the night, typically I do 5mg lines every 30 mins - 1hr.

It’s a very fun drug and I just love being on it. It gives me that same type of joy as being in elementary school, watching the clock tick down as it’s at 2:58 on a Friday afternoon. I feel so content yet motivated and exited for what’s coming next, which is a rare, and (at least for me) enjoyable emotion I don’t feel often.

I wanted to do my Guide that i follow about Safe Drug use and would like to see some of your own guidelines that you follow to do a bit of a comparison between different people on this sub.
Included Drugs used
Marijuana, Amphetamin, Cocain, Lsd, Mushrooms, 2CB, Ketamin, MDMA, Nitrous, Alcohol, how regular, dosage, mixing substances. 

First of all what i assume is the drug mostly used: 

Marijuana

I use it most of the time 2-3 weeks daily until my batch rans out and then wait 3-4 weeks before i get more again to have like a cooldown time. Dosage 0.4-0.7 per joint and one or two joints a day. 
Mixes well with and is chemicaly as physically safe to mix with alcohol, nitrous (which i stopped a few months ago because it started to give me anxiety), lsd (be cautious of the strongly enhanced psychedelic effect, mushrooms (see lsd), 

Amphetamin 

I have ADHD and Amphetamins make me and my brain very chill and calm for days and up to weeks afterwards. I feel more controled and in a much stronger physical space as i.e. after lsd or mushroom trips which also has days and weeks of more opposite aftereffects.
Makes u feel great but the higher you fly the lower you fall and it can be hard to stop like with most Stimulants.
Im using speed every 1-2 month on one night binges were i go through 0.3-0.5g. On increasing lines from 30-100mg. Im fine with the dosage i would just try to decrease it to every 3-4 months at best. 
I do not mix speed with anything as the risk for the heart can be very high when used with other stimulants or depressivs like alcohol which it is used with alot of times.
The increased energy, talkactivity and overall socialness(?) is very nice.

Cocain

Short and simple every 3-6 months set amount of lines but never more than 0.3g alltogether.
I can not deny having a slight craving for coke up to 2 weeks so imo less is more when it comes to cocain usage. Also not a substance i would mix as its really nice on its own and  brings unnecessary risk for heart, blood pressure or decreases the cocain effect which no one would want to happen :). Most people are unaware of the strong longterm effects cocain has on your circulatory system and it can led to problems long after you stopped.

LSD 

Physicaly so safe (be sure it is lsd tho) that i had times were i took it weekly in all doses but will be very exhausting for your mental. Psychotic effects like anxiety and panic attacks can happen. Hasnt happened so far but there were scary moments. Seeing things u dont wanna see that fuck your mind too hard.
Funny shapes and colors is nice but i love it for the psychedelic effect and it has taught me a lot of things about myself, opened up my soul and i feel overall better days and weeks afterwards. My experience ranges from 100 too 1000qg doses. Some stronger and weaker trips on same dosages and my favourite: LSD on a airplane while traveling. Amazing. Important note: Do not take psychedelics when in  a bad mental state as it acts strongly as a mood enhancer not a mood maker like coke,mdma etc.
Can be mixed with Weed (be aware of strongly enhanced psychedelic effects), nitrious (ditto), or 2CB with greatly enhances the visual effects and gives you little mdma high.
Or mix it with mdma itself for a nice Candyflip. When taking with 2cb or mdma take care of sufficient water intake as these substances dry you out quicker.

Mushrooms

They feel more natural than lsd. I take shrooms when i feel like it usually leaving 2-5 months inbetween each use. Doses i took range from 1g to 4g. Better dose lower on your first times as a friend suffered from anxiety whenever he got high on anything after a first 1g shroom experience. Same as LSD 
Mood enhancer not mood maker. It might go very bad and turn into a horrotrip for the next few hours.
Mix with weed for stronger effects and/or nitrous for EVEN STRONGER effects.

2CB

Its a nice party substance but it has a long and quite awful comedown that gave me a terrible headache for 2 days everytime so far. Idk why i still take it.
Dosages i took 18mg-25mg (one pill)
I leave here aswell 2-4 months inbetween aiming for 3-4.
Cool colors you see and sounds are great aswell gets you in a good mood but can wear off unexpectedly quick.
Mixing goes with LSD and nitrous. Effects of that above.

Ketamin

I fucked up the dose for the first time and it lead to long bathroom time and very unpleasent effects overall. If you want to be able to walk dont take more than 30mg when having Racemat Ketamin or 5-15 when taking (S)-Ketamin as its Anestathic effects are quite stronger. I had 100mg of (S)-Ketamin and there was nothing enjoyable about the state i got myself into with that.
I wouldnt mix it as its very potent on its own and can led to a big variety of shortterm risks when taken with with other depressants or stimulants allthough its medicaly used together with benzodiazephines. Same as most drugs leave 3-4 months inbetween each use.

MDMA 

Usage every 3-6 months for good festivals or concerts. I dont want to waste the greatness of MDMA in my room.
You are best off using the 1.5g/kg bodymass for males (with my 80kg i take 120-140) and 1.3mg/kg bodymass for females and maybe add 10-20% for stronger but still relativly safe rolling. These Guidelines exist for a reason as we dont want anyone odeing on Emma. It can lead up death with doses as low as 300mg.
Dont mix with depressivs as your body gets very confused chemically or stimulants which lets your heartrate increase even more. Dont get to hot and drink enough. 250ml/h is recommended.
Can be mixed with lsd or nitrous as mentioned before. Weed is ok but rather bad than good for your enjoyment as it lets you come down quicker.

Nitrous

I used it 2-3 times a week with up to 6 capsules each night. Brings you in a psychedelic headspace with a warm/paralyzed body feeling. At some point it started to give me anxiety lasting a few days and i stopped using it. I mentioned most things about Nitrous already. Its a great enhancer for various drugs and is quick fun on its own but can have unwanted psychological effects. Stay safe.

Alcohol

The for me most uninteresting drug that i only use when its not time for other things or i dont feel like anything. Just dont drink too much and youre good.

After getting hit I went to my friends house to ask what to do, I know I should of gone hospital but I was very out of it. He lets me in an says “Jesus you looked fucked, are you trippping ?” I told him no and tried to explain that I’d been hit in the head but he thought I was just having a bad trip and was little disoriented. He tried to show me trippy YT videos to calm me down while badgering me about what’d I had taken, I even said LSD a few times because of I thought I had

While concussed I actually had an intense ego death which really freaked me out and I felt incredibly disoriented, it would of been fun if I had been a little more comfortable and not worrying about my head injury, although I began to forget I had a head injury and my friend kept telling me I was tripping so I just thought I was very high . My friend starts to realise somethings wrong as I’m rambling and very confused, thought he was my brother at one point, he keeps trying to ask me what I took and I keep saying nothing I need a hospital. He assumed I was just panicking on drugs and didn’t think a hospital would help would be able to help.

He phoned more friends to come round and at this point I’m in out of conscious and I kept thinking I was in my lounge until I would realise I’m surrounded by my friends in another friends house. Everything became so bright and I began to feel like I was honestly dying, like a step further than ego death and I saw my an old man who told me I had to stay awake. I also kept seeing a man with long hair watching me even though he apparently wasn’t their. At this point my friends mum is looking at me and asks what I’m on and I manage to tell her I was hit in the head and she realised that I had a cut on my head, even though it hadn’t been bleeding much. Apparently they were driving me to hospital at this point but I didn’t realise. 

I was diagnosed with no permanent damage and apparently blood loss had caused a lot of the confusion but I didn’t remember bleeding though I don’t remember bleeding at all. This despite just getting hit in the head this trip changed my life more than any psychedelic , yes I do call it a trip. After all this apparently my personality changed slightly and I am more serious and also take more risks. It’s changed my perspective on life completely not that I would recommend concussing yourself for an intense trip

If their is doctor reading this please give me some insight, could I off died and why has my personality changed slightly ?

I have an awesome backyard. It's not MASSIVE, but it's pretty big. It's got a nice patio with lots of swing chairs, windchimes and tiki torches. It also has a lot of trees and a couple hammocks. Plus, my backyard is right on top of a lake. There's a little dock down there, and it's such a great place to go sit and take in the lake and all the trees/vegetation around it. And though I'm not as far out in the country as I could be, there are still plenty of stars visible at night.

And inside, my room is great for trips too.  Lots of cool lights and decorations, a very cozy bed with lots of comfy blankets, and a fantastic entertainment system (computer, tv, consoles, bluetooth speaker, and a record player). I like to spend my peak outside running around the yard and listening to music by the lake, but afterwards it's just awesome to come back to my room and relax and listen to music or watch something trippy.

Roughly a month ago my wife and I decided to dose on shrooms. I've been out of work and it's been a fair amount of time since the last trip. Why not, right? I bought us each 4.2 grams and we went from there. We used two different methods, she ate hers all at once and I are mine consistently throughout the first hour or so.
I've used shrooms a handful of times and have even gone as far as doing a quad to myself just because. My wife has used them twice before this trip. (Important info for later.) 

Anyway, the first 4 hours of the trip were amazing! Like the first time again. Heavy visuals, moderate body high and minimal nausea. During our trips we usually decide on a television show we both like and go with it. This particular time we chose ""Workaholics."" One of my favorites. 

For those of you familiar with the show we got to the episode where the guys end up doing acid in a motel room with their boss. The episode itself is hysterical! However, at some point this particular episode flipped my trip on it's head. I spent the next 3-4 hours (by my wife's account) sweating profusely and holding onto my sanity for dear life. Never before have I ever felt as close to losing touch with reality as I was then. The Best way to explain how I felt was that scene in Disney's Hercules when the witches are trying to cut Hercules's lifeline, only the ""lifeline"" was my connection to reality and everything around me. I ended up laying in her lap with my sweat soaked t-shirt draped over my head and attempted explaining my mindset to her without much luck. Luckily I didn't ruin her trip and really didn't ruin mine either, I guess shit just got way too real for a second there.

my hallucinations were growing stronger as we walked and i was starting to see images of myself flashing before my eyes. i have always been a very insecure person and i have quietly struggled with my mental health for a very long time, and a lot of my problems stem from family trauma. in the back of my mind i worried how this could affect my trip. i started to see myself in a really negative light and i was constantly being reminded by my hallucinations of how ugly i feel deep down. i was also starting to see images of my parents in an almost demonic way. but i remained calm and tried to ride it out. by the time we got to her car, my friend was tripping a lot but she wasn’t seeing hallucinations like i was. she started to feel nauseous and decided she need to throw up (likely from eating before) and this definitely scared me even more. my sober friend was definitely no help and made us feel like we were acting crazy. after she threw up, my friend felt much better, but i was definitely in shock a little. we sat in the car and listened to frank ocean, and i decided to close my eyes and let the drug do what it was meant for. i started to see intense visions of symbols that looked like the sort of thing you’d find in an ancient cave. however, my subconscious was still pestering me, and i couldn’t shake the bad feeling from the images i was seeing. we walked my sober friend home and i was still tripping pretty hard. but once we got back home, everything took a turn for the better.
we sat in my room and turned on adventure time, and i was still hallucinating. my friend was a good distraction though, and did her best to keep me grounded by talking to me. the colors and patterns looked vibrant and beautiful, but it was hard to pay attention when the rest of room was moving and i was experiencing an intense body high. as i slowly started to come down, my friend and i talked for what felt like hours about anything and everything. as the weed wore off, i started to feel immensely better and we realized how hard we were tripping just a few hours ago. as we were talking i started to make realizations about my trip and i began to start thinking in ways i never had before. i began to realize how little i value myself, and how much i worry about how other people view me. i came to terms with the fact that my mental health was not at its best, and there is a lot of trauma that i keep to myself.
i started to feel more at peace and though i was felt such a deep love and soul connection for my friend. the rest of the night my mind was full of questions and realizations and i couldn’t seem to fall asleep.
though the experience was scary, i feel like it was necessary. i feel as though i have a different way of thinking and i want to actively try to better myself. next time i try a psychedelic i will definitely be a lot more wary of how hard the drug can hit you.

I was throwing up. I couldn’t distract myself because games, videos, etc tripped me out even more. I was basically walking in circles around my room, banging my head on the wall. Even texted my buddy to bring me a benzo but he was sleeping. It was hell for 2 hours. I then started having existential thoughts that completely changed my perspective on life. My whole room looked like a swirly cartoon, stuff I would have expected from 4g or some shit. A lot of stuff and realizations I had during the trip I can’t really put into words. My ego was heavily dissolved. 

By the end of the trip I was crying my eyes out with a feeling of love and appreciation that was more euphoric then any drug I’ve ever tried.

Def a bad trip turned good.

2g however was very intense. During the trip I was so glad I didn’t take more.

It’s since been 2 weeks however and the trip showed me these substances can actually teach you a lot. I feel like even from that trip I came out a better person.

I however don’t know how much to dose my next trip as I’m clearly sensitive.

I think my next dose however I’m gonna lemon tek a higher dose like 3.5. So it’ll be a shorter but more intense trip.

Does anyone here do these ""short"" stints of sobriety?

My only experience with drugs are Haze strain weed and a horrendous hellish trip on what I think but could never verify was PCP laced weed. Had ego death and Enlightenment where I saw reality was just me in this void reading this book that was the whole universe (not literally but it was a visual metaphor I'm also still dissociated from that trip which was 8 years ago). I constantly fluctuated between that voidly awareness and my cooked out mind in the ""real"" world. The loneliness in the Absolute was fucking awfull. Fuck. Really traumatizing.

I'm thinking of doing this alone tho since I'm a recluse and get really anxious around people which is why I stopped smoking weed with other people, weed is fun alone but when I'm with others I get so fucking tense and extremely aware of everything that it just ruins it.

I'm also thinking of doing it in a hotel room or some shit just listening to music since I live right next to a busy street that makes A LOT of sudden LOUD noises. Forests are a no-go since my country is waay too densely populated and too many people roam there.

Body Stats:

————————————————————

Gender: Male

Age: 15.5

Weight (LBS): 125

Height: 5’5”

Activity: Very Frequent, High Intensity


——————————————————————


Timeline:

——————————————————————

1mg Alprazolam (~6:30AM)

600mg ibuprofen (~6:30)

30mg Vyvanse (~7:00AM)

Workout starts (8:00AM)

Workout ends (10:00AM)

Vaped a little bit, 5% nicotine (~10:00AM)

Drank lots of water before, during, and after working out.


——————————————————————

First off, let me say I know I’m way too young to be doing drugs, and I’m already slowing down on them (completely quitting when school starts). I’m a straight grade A student at a fairly prestigious private school, and I have never let drugs get in the way of my life, family, or school.

I always do in-depth research before trying something new, and take a small dose (around people) days before to make sure I don’t have a bad reaction. 

I’m not interested in PEDs, though I was considering it, but realized they can badly affect development at my age, and can really fuck up my hormones. Hard pass.

I make sure my friends know what I’m on and what dosage, so they can inform paramedics in case of a really bad reaction, this has never happened, but it’s better to be safe than sorry! 

I also have a trusted family member who I can talk to (with a background in medicine), and friends who know what I’m on and when.

——————————————————————

My Vyvanse is prescription, although I almost never take it (about once or twice a month, though I’m prescribed to take it daily), so I always get a stronger reaction.

The Xanax is directly from a local pharmacy (I actually know the guy who manages that one, super nice guy), so I know it’s not pressed with anything crazy. I have only taken even 1mg, and don’t plan to ever take more, as I know benzos can be dangerous, especially at my age.

I usually take 600mg ibuprofen before a workout due to shin and calf pain, but it has little effect.

I only vape RIGHT after workouts (Mon-Thurs) to chill out, and for the effects it has on acetylcholine. Other than that I only do it socially and with friends on weekends, I don’t even own a vape. I was addicted around New Years when I had one, then quit.


——————————————————————


Workout Experience:

——————————————————————

Weights-

Today seemed a little easier for me. In the gym, I benched 115 (new personal best), and front squatted 95. I’m new to weights and bodybuilding, so I’m still trying to find my sweet spot. Also did a few more weight workouts, but I can’t remember what (coaches give us a printed out routine).


Running-

This is where I noticed an extreme difference. For some context, I have exercise induced asthma. During sprints, I normally have to stop and throw up, or take a break while everyone else runs, because I’m wheezing and coughing too much. Today was very different. My recovery time was cut in half, and I felt like my breathing was much smoother. I also have shin splints and  running usually murders my calf’s. Today I felt VERY little pain (maybe even none) in my calfs and shins. During a few sets of sprints, I was the fastest guy there, while I’m normally in the middle to last.


After-

Normally I just wait in my ride, don’t really talk to people much (recovering from anti-social tendencies). This time, I was just relaxing and shooting the shit with the rest of the guys, then got breakfast with them. Made a few new friends. Xanax probably took away most of my anxiety, and the Vyvanse tends to make me more social.


——————————————————————

TLDR: Overall, this was probably the best workout I’ve had in my life. Focused, relaxed, but still sober.

I am in recovery now without any outside help.

5Htp supplements are not available in my country. Can you guys guide me with any fruit or veggies that had 5htp contents

This took place a few months ago before everything got shut down and I figured i would tell this story whenever I got a chance and well im currently procrastinating my work from home internship so why not.

So me and my friends are heavy into Dubstep and we went to go see probably one of my favorite producers, Liquid Stranger. It was a concert during the middle of the week but I sort of have a weird thing were i first saw him when i was tripping at a festival and wanted to continue the streak. I dropped a tab of acid around 7pm and with my roommate who took molly and brought a dmt vape pen waited for our friends that were gonna do just a little K for the concert. The ride up was chill, i put on this great aussie band called Sticky Fingers that I recommend to anybody they’re that great. So we all get to the venue and this is actually the first time ive ever been to the Roxian near Pittsburgh. I didn’t know at first but the venue is notorious for kicking people out but we’ll get to that in a minute.

The place is built in such a trippy way also. It has 2 floors and a basement and the floor stairs are separated by doors. Of course im tripping so im just exploring the whole place and having epiphanies left and right. There was one point I had gum in my pocket didn’t realize it and when i felt it and pulled it out it blew my mind. Its funny that acid blows your mind with the simplest things but anyway. I was going to school about a 45 minute drive outside of Pittsburgh so I ran into a few friends and even made some new friends w this guy who recognized me from town. But soon thats when things started to turn south.

So the headliner has been on for about idk maybe 30 minutes now. I was on the balcony and my friend that took the molly never went up to see what the balcony looked like at all. All of a sudden i get calls and text messages “dude they just kicked me out fuck fuck i need you to come help me”. I start thinking to myself “what the fuck this can’t be real” and this feeling of dread just washes over me. Meanwhile i get our other friends that we were with to meet down in the lobby to try figuring out what a game plan needed to be. I meet the guy who got kicked out at the smoking spot outside and he says hes gonna hand me his stuff and hes going to try jumping back into the smokers area. I currently have no words for this. But as soon as he started handing me stuff thats when the staff said “no you have to go, leave, 100ft from the property” so after i sent him a text saying “yeah I don’t think I would’ve been able to help there.” By this time my sober friends came down to the lobby and one agreed to go to the car with the one that got kicked out since it was cold and raining outside.

So the concert wraps up and I didn’t enjoy it as much as i wanted to because of what happened. So finally We get to the million dollar question of why did my friend get thrown out? We he was on the main concert venue floor and hit his dmt pen on the stairs and wasn’t getting up. A security guy asked him to get up and he didn’t comply so they just figured he got too fucked up and threw him out. Funny enough he probably could have gotten away with it if he was up in the balcony where there’s seats. Needless to say i was pissed at him for a pretty long time and him talking about how the guards were assholes made me honestly more pissed about how I felt about the situation. I had this thought going through my head like “why fucking me why the fuck do i have to pick up everyone elses shit and fix THEIR problems.” But i also realized that for as bad and angry i was at my friend, he was probably feeling even worse at that time. We’ve both made up for it and honestly hes a good guy and actually smart with drugs since he did some dealing. He was just stupid about how he did what he did and could have done it differently. 

But yeah the ride home was great and we talked about how we all felt and he had some extra K so he gave me a lil bump and when we got back to my house he smoked me up w some dabs and i copped some etizolam to help me sleep. All in all it was still a good night. That night showed me how far I’ve come from a psychedelic point from having a challenging first trip with lsd to being able to handle this. I ended up appreciating Liquid strangers music even more after this.

I think that in moderation and responsible, harm-reductive consumption of these substances can be beneficial for my livelihood.

I admitted that I have plans to try psychedelics later in life (as they do not know ab my prior LSD trips) and they were extremely disappointed. Granted they have no other knowledge of them outside of the negative stigma they carry, I don't blame them for their reaction, but I am curious as to what some of you may think about this topic.

I feel like I am perfectly in control of my use of substances and practice harm-reduction in all cases. So, are there those of you who have had/have this mindset in regards to using and were able to maintain that level of control as it progressed? Or haven't been able to?

To preface this we've been close for about 6 years since the 8th grade. He (I'll call him George for the sake of privacy) told me he's tripped on shrooms or acid close to 30 times, a couple times candy flipping, and a couple times &lt;600 ug. He has told me he's a pathological liar so I take everything he says with a grain of salt but I've been around him tripping about 10 times so I don't doubt his trip numbers. He previously had a super bad trip on shrooms like 2 months ago. Sorry for the wall of text but I just want to rant about the shit I had to go through to save George. The story consists of my closest friends, I'll call them George, Jake and Jason (None of these are their real names ofc)

Ok, so the night started with Jake, he was hanging with George, us three planned to smoke weed that night since he had the house to himself. They both popped tabs at around 9 so I knew just about I was in for hanging with them, usually a chill vibe. USUALLY. Jake facetimes Jason and I, saying he needs helps with George, turns out he had taken off his jeans and underwear and is attempting to fight with Jake. Jake said he’s barely talking and is unable to be reasoned with, I lived about 1 mile away and Jason was 40 minutes away. I put some xanax that I’m prescribed, duct tape, and rope in a backpack and got on my bike. In about 10 minutes I got there, Jake opens the door and I see George sitting on the couch, thankfully with underwear on, just staring at the empty wall. I said hey to him and he just looked at me with empty eyes. Jake said he had been silent for about an hour before he started stripping+fighting which is similar to what he did on shrooms a while ago (the quietness). He stands up, stumbles towards me and attempts to punch me, but I dodge just in time and get him back on the couch. Then this dude spit on me. White, bubbly spit. That pushed me over the edge, Jake and I forced him down and held him on the couch. He’s easily 50 pounds heavier than either of us so it was easier said than done. He’s shaking his head from side to side with such force I was scared he’d get brain damage. We tried to give him some water and a xanax to calm him down but he pushes it out with his tongue. I try 2 more times to get him to take that damn pill but he’s adamant about not taking it. He’s shaking at this point and frankly we were both scared for him and us. We managed to get his hands tied in front of him so he can’t punch us, he try’s kicking but we duct tape his legs before he can land a kick. All three of us are on the floor now, he’s on his back but we roll him on his stomach so he doesn’t drown in his own spit. He’s talking now, proclaiming “I am God.” and “I am Tupac.” By that time Jason finally got to the house. George attempted to get up so I grabbed his arms from behind and brought him to a sitting position. He’s scratching me and spitting the whole time. While I have him restrained, we try to come up with a plan. We can’t just drop him off at a hospital basically hogtied, and we can’t call the cops because we have enough drugs to sedate a small country between the 4 of us. We decide the best course of action is to call his mom, but none of us have her number. We asked George what his phone passcode was but all he said was “Dinosaur.” The best move was to take him back to his house. We struggle to carry him to the back of Jake’s pickup. He’s safe in the bed of the truck on his side. All four of us drive on the highway doing 35 in a 60, George screaming at the top of his lungs most of the ride there. Thank whatever is up there no police were in the area or I’d be typing this from a jail cell. We park outside his house to find he’s gotten out of the restraints and is standing in the bed. Jason rings the doorbell and his mom walks out, George has hopped out on to the street at this point and is just staring at Jake like a tiger would look at a lamb. His mom screams “What the fuck George?” Prompting him to turn to her, walk straight past her into the darkness of his house. We walk in with his mom to see George lying on his bed, eyes open just a blank stare. His mom is balling her eyes out talking to us about how bad the situation is. After talking a bit more we checked on him again and he was breathing so we all drove back to Jake’s house, I biked home, covered in scratches, George’s spit and sweat I just took a shower and hit the sack. He texted me the next day asking if I was there that night, I explained to him what happened and he just laughed like he usually does. I’m scared for him. It’s like he lives in his own la-la land even sober. Always talking about the future where he’s successful but fails to realize that if he continues his fuckery, there will be no future for him. He had just crashed his car while high on weed the week prior. Sorry for venting but I just wanted to get this off my chest. Does this sound like a normal bad acid trip? He said that he just took lsd but I doubt it. Could it be a RC or something? Our friend group plans to have an intervention with him about his substance abuse soon.

Here's  a brief version. Tried MDMA in the summer of 2017, then couple months  after started to abuse it, during the worst months I would roll every  weekend 2 - 3 pills, one time popped 5 over the night, and couldn't pee  for 12 hours. Abuse lasted for 2 years straight.

Stuff  that I ingested was 100% not pure, though I didn't care at the time,  because I was and I am stupid and irresponsible. It was probably laced  with amphetamines, or god knows what.

I  am now 10 months sober (last roll was at august of 2019). Because my of  abuse, I don't find sex interesting anymore. To fix this, I went to  urologist and he prescribed me natural testosterone boosters, which  helped a little. My testosterone is at normal levels now, but I still  don't find sex interesting.

I work out 4 days a week for a month, I drink HTP-5, I think it helps a little, but not much.

Could  my loss interest of sex be related to messed up dopamine / serotonin  production? Anyone had similar experiences? Has anyone recovered? What  supplements should I consider getting?

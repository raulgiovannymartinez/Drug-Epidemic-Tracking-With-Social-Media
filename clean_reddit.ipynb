      "1291 selftext I have stopped use of edibles for more than 2 months due to corona. However the shop was open yesterday so I bought a edible. I swallowed the big black ugly tasting shitting fucking shit. I couldnt eat it alone as it has worst taste ever. However I ate it with chywanprash. I didn't feel much upto slight less than  two hours so I thought it was of bad quality. I went to eat dinner and my appetite was slightly increased. Then suddenly when I completed my eating OH GOD. It hit me, as I was watching, I first smiled and smiled. Soon my smile changed into uncontrollable laughter and oh got. For sometime I was laughing and laughing. When the effect was in peak, I chewed about 2 betel nuts. It was so stimulating that I was feeling sleepy and at the same time quite energized. This was max peak time so I drank 30ml of Bacopa Monnieri to increase its effect. Then I started to dance. I kept on dancing and dancing weirdly moving my head here and there. My parents saw me and I told them I was exercising. Oh god they didn't knew. Later, I chewed more nuts and music was AWESOME. This was the best feeling of my life. As it was first time I tried cannabis after so long I was feeling extremely awesome. Bacopa is great drug enhancer and so is betel nut\n",

I’m still recovering from today as I write this. Backstory: I took ~6 grams of mushrooms today. Took it with lemon juice (increases bioavailability?)

I wanted to get through the Tao te Ching, so I started listening to that. I thought maybe it would be a good way to settle in. Yea I’m THAT kind of person okay so anyways. Maybe 10 to 15 minutes had passed and I was in that phase where I didn’t know if anything was happing to me. I’m not an inexperienced user so I kind of know what to expect. 

The first thing I noticed was my body started to get really heavy. And then other things started to happen, most of it was terrifying, and had never happened to me during a trip: 

- I took off all my clothes because it felt like my skin was on fire, or freezing cold, I’m not sure
- at one point, I looked in the mirror and I was drenched in sweat 
- it felt centipedes crawling beneath my skin, I tried really hard not to focus on it but holy I think that made it worse. I can’t describe how odd that felt
- i threw up somewhere around the middle, and before I started feeling better, there was this period of time where I wasn’t sure if it was scarier opening my eyes or closing them with the things I was hallucinating. 
-  my thoughts felt like physical extensions of my body. Now that’s really freaking weird when one of my ideas in my head feels like it’s actually a part of my toe? 
- at the end of it all, I had torn all the sheets off my bed, and I drank more fuckin water than I ever have in my life. 
- no matter what I just couldn’t get comfortable for what felt like hours. At this point I really regretted taking them. 

Time distortion is particularly messed up when going through a bad trip, so trying to bear all that that felt like forever. I can totally see why people might kill themselves trying to escape a temporary bad trip. I was worried of dying quite a few times.... so yeah. Enlightening. Those were scary thoughts. Overall quite a bad experience, I think I’ll be more responsible in the future. Please do share similar experiences, I wonder if anyone has had similar symptoms.

I think it's important to notice that I didn't take them everyday, I'd usually skip two and at least one day in between doses.

These doses have been ranging from 2mg to 6mg. Today, I took my last 5mg before deciding to give it a break. Can I quit cold turkey right now or should I taper? Also important to notice that I just took them yesterday and today, and my last dose before that was on tuesday.

We were going to see the band Homeshake perform at the Union Transfer. This band is fairly psychedelic so we figured that we would probably do some drugs for the show. A few hours before the concert my friend had told me that he had acquired three capsules of 4-AcO-DMT. I do not know nor remember the dose of each capsule. Both of us were fairly experienced with psychedelics having had plenty of acid, shroom, and dmt trips before. I had had one experience prior with 4-AcO-DMT, but my friend had never tried it himself. I personally have never had a negative reaction to psychedelics, but my friend has had a few less than ideal trips in the past here and there. Anyways, he decides that he wants to take some of it before the show. My friend messages the guy that he got them from and asks what the recommended dosage is. Unforunately this person never responded and thus my friend decided to take all three capsules before the show. I figured we'd be alright with myself as the tripsitter. My friend having been a dealer at the time brought us along two well rolled blunts for us to smoke at some point before, during, or after the show.

We took the subway from our apartment over to the venue and scoped out a nice spot to watch the show from a side riser.  The opener who's name escapes me because it was the worst opener for any concert I have ever seen. It was some acoustic guitar player guy with wind noises playing in the back. A less than ideal opening act for a band I was planning on dancing to plenty. During the opening act my friend takes out a blunt for us and we begin smoking it. Obviously smoking of any kind is not permitted in this 1,200 person capacity, indoor venue. We figured we would be fine doing it as we had done it before. Philadelphia is a fairly liberal city with weed being decrminalized so most people won't make any fuss. Its also hard for security people to get through the large crowd during the show. We passed the blunt back and forth to each other alternating hits. I was careful to always exhale down and away from the direction of the stage so that my smoke would not be revealed  by the concert lights. My friend made no such efforts and happily blew large plumes of smoke directly overhead audience members with no concern of being reprimanded.  The opening performance finally ended after dragging on for what seemed like forever. It was honestly the worst opening act I've seen and I've seen my fair share of concerts.

We wait the 30 or so minutes in between sets and Homeshake finally comes out on stage. We were both fairly eccentric early 20's college students, but my friend was the type to get really hyped up over something and just start yelling. He started yelling out ""shake shake shake it up!"" in reference to the band's name. As they began playing their first song my friend pulls out the second blunt and lights it up. We're both dancing around and singing and loving the performance, my friend especially as he was a longer time and bigger fan of the band than I was. Again I continue to exhale down and away from the lights in order to not reveal myself. Again my friend was just exhaling directly out into the audience and ignoring any sign of authority as he tends to do. He quickly spots another audience member about a foot or two away but slightly below us because we were on a riser behind a railing, smoking a blunt same as us. My friend entranced by the drugs and the concert makes a gesture to the other audience member to swap blunts. At the time I was like why are you doing this it seems unncecessary, but my friend just seemed to be enjoying himself and enjoying finding a fellow concert member partaking in cannibis. A moment after the two swap blunts a bright light flashes at us multiple times. I immediately realize that this is not a light from the stage but a light coming from behind us from likely a security guard signaling us to stop. Knowing that the security guard probably wouldn't actually come over to us we both sort of just ignored it. At this point I was no longer smoking the blunt concious that I didn't want to push my luck, but my friend took his last few puffs of the strangers blunt and swapped back with him. Again a light blares at us this time for a few seconds longer and noticeable to a decent amount of the audience. Someone had obviously spotted us. Both blunts were sort of just put away and the concert continued. We only had two blunts so that was the end of that and I didn't expect anything else to happen with security flashing lights at us. The show continues and the band has played through about six songs. In my mind everything is going great. A moment later my friend leans over to me and whispers that he's leaving the concert. I was immediately alarmed at why he would want to be leaving when on the outside everything was perfectly fine and we were enjoying a concert together. He says I don't have to come with him, but being as were are very close friends/roomates and me being aware that he's likely tripping super hard, I didn't want to leave him alone. We shuffle out of the venue as the show continues. The security guards at the gate were surprised to see anyone leaving the show so early, but we quckly got out of there.

As  soon as we are away from the venue he beings to tell me about how the police are on to him. I assumed that he was just spooked about the security guard flashing the light at us while tripping. I continue to inquire about why he thinks the police are onto us and reassuring him that we were in absolutely no danger. He begins to tell me all kinds of crazy things. At the time of this going on both of us were students at Temple Univeristy. At this time in 2019, Temple had a fairly large mumps outbreak. My friend starts to tell me things about how he is the one infecting everyone else with mumps. Neither of us have ever had the mumps. During these times my friend was also a drug dealer who moved a pretty significant amount of weight of various substances. He tells me how each person coming to purchase from him has been infected with mumps by him and that they are spreading it around the school. About halfway back from the venue to the subway station, I realize that my friend is missing both his glasses and his jacket that he brought with him to the show. He is also wearing a beanie now and wasn't wearing one on the way to the show. I ask him where these things are. He tells me that he purposefully left his glasses and jacket at the venue and put the beanie on in an attempt to disguise himself from the police. Knowing that he's gonna be pissed later when he stops tripping and is missing his glasses and jacket, I urge for us to go back and retrieve these items. He reassures me that he'll get them at a later time and that its not safe right now. I decided that it was whatever and that it'd probably just be better to get back to the apartment and chill in a more stable environment.

We board the subway without too much trouble the whole time my friend seems to trip harder and harder and deluding himself into worse and worse paranoia. I was perfectly calm in this situation confident that I'd be able to control the situation. I continue to reassure him with good thoughts about hanging at the apartment. It was very apparent to me that this was a much more severe reaction to psychedelics than I've ever seen my friend have. He really seemed to believe all of the crazy and rediculous things he was telling me. He was very much not like himself as we both can usually handle larger doses of psychedelics. He tells me that he's having some excellent vivid psychedelic visuals. I'm glad that he's at least enjoying some part of his trip. We get off at our subway stop and begin the walk back to our apartment. A few blocks from being home my roomate suddently grabs the lighter from his pocket that I had lent him earlier that night and throws it forcefully out into someone's backyard. I immediately ask him why he did this, also slightly disapointed about losing my lighter. His response: sorry, evidence. Still convinced the police are after him we make it back to the apartment.

When we get back to the apartment he immediately thinks that we've been raided by the police. He begins to freak out thinking that one of his friends gave him up to the police and that he was going to be arrested. We get inside and he realizes that this is not the case but he still believes that the police are on their way and he's in a panic. He asks to be alone. Although still spouting some craziness my friend seems relatively alright so I oblige and leave him in his room. I was a bit worried though that he would call the police and give himself up. After about 15 minutes I come to check on him. He asks me to bring him some water. I go to bring him some water and he asks for me to leave it at the door. Apparently he still believed that he had contagious mumps and wanted to spare me of them.  After another 20 minutes or so I return to check on him again. This time he has a slightly sadder tone to his voice. He begins to tell me that he wants to kill himself. Obviously this could be very serious, but very out of character for my him so I made to continue to reassure my friend that everything was going to be fine. I even began to tell him about some of my experiences dealing with suicidal thoughts and depression myself, things that I'd not told to nearly any of my other friends. My speaking casually about these things seemed to calm him down. He tells me that he wants to delete all of his social media and then all of his contacts in order to rid his phone of potential evidence against him. I suggest that he doesn't do these things while tripping and to wait to be clear headed to make this choice that he would likely regret later.  After a little while of talking he asks if I can call his girlfriend for him. I call her up and before handing the phone over to him quickly explained the fragile and bizarre state that he is in to his girlfriend. He tells her that he needs to get rid of all of his product and to move it to her place because our place was bugged by the cops. After a short conversation she comes over to comfort him as she lived a few houses down. Within about 45 minutes since we got back to the apartment and maybe 10 minutes since his girlfriend arrived he is almost completely sober again and we are joking about the complete insanity that he was spewing minutes before. The next day I decide to inquire about the overall impression of the experience as it seemd like a particularly wild trip and ask my friend how he thought his trip went. To my great surprise his response was that he actually enjoyed the trip a lot. This is a really long story thanks for reading.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My friend takes psychedelics. We go to a concert and a security guard flashes a light at us for smoking weed. My friend absolutely trips out and believes that the cops are after us and that he's infecting people with mumps. We leave the concert and he sort of loses his mind for a bit and gets rediculously paranoid.

I have also just looked in the mirror and told myself that I have a cocaine problem.

I am lying here on my sofa with a duvet it’s 5:35, daylight is coming through the curtains, birds are singing. I have not slept or eaten since  Saturday. I lost the ability to breathe through my nose at some point on Sunday.

I have spent £400 on cocaine since Saturday when I went out to the newly reopened pubs for “1 pint” I have only stopped early this morning because I do not have any more money or any more cocaine. I thought I did have more cocaine,  so it was unpleasant discovering I had run out.

My current shameful situation has been building for some time now. As is standard in the UK, the majority of my friends take cocaine. We meet up and drink and take cocaine together and we laugh. Then they go home to bed and sleep. I used to do the same.  Used to. Something has creeped up on me over the past few months. I am not going home to bed anymore. I am going home and getting more cocaine, and when that runs out I’ll get some more, all the way through the next day until I have no money left. Delivery of cocaine is (dangerously) a very efficient 24 hour service where I live.

My partner admitted to me that he had a cocaine problem some time ago, and that he has calmed down his drug use considerably since we began our relationship. I foolishly believed that doing some cocaine together recreationally with friends at the weekend was fairly harmless and ‘not the same thing’. Well, here I am today, lying at rock bottom. My partner told me at several points during the bender that we ‘didn’t need another bag’ and that I should call it a day. I wasn’t up for hearing any of that.

So here I am! Today I feel like death on a stick, my mind is racing, I can’t sleep, anxiety is through the roof. I dont want to look at my bank account. I don’t know how I’m going to survive for the rest of the month on whatever is left in there (I assume less than £100). Panic attacks are threatening to surface every few minutes. I’m dehydrated. I’m nauseaous. I’m covered in marks and open sores because for some reason when I’m off my head I like to pop ‘spots’ that dont actually exist all over my body. I have a crippling feeling of shame, guilt and doom. And I have decided this is the time to be honest about my cocaine use, which has clearly become (a very expensive) problem. The question is what do I do from here? And where do I look for some help with this if i need it? I’m not an everyday user, sometimes I go a fortnight without cocaine so I don’t think a rehab stint would be the right call.

I would love to hear some similar experiences from people, the high times, the low times, how people have managed to regain control after abusing a drug. 

I would love to hear from anybody really, this comedown is going to be absolutely brutal, I could do with some company!

A friend in the medical community, though not my doctor, advised the beta blocker propranolol (trade name Inderal) to help take the edge off. I managed to get a script off my doc after some persuading.

Well yesterday I took two pills after coming doing from my Adderall (this was around 10 pm) and then  proceeded to have horrible insomnia followed by the most intense, vivid,  horrible dreams I've ever had. I've had bouts of sleep paralysis in the  past (which can get very intense), but those compared nothing to what I  experienced last night.

 I was experiencing extremely vivid (almost  lucid-like) nightmares, and then I would wake up temporarily and  hallucinate (in my actual room) people and things around me. Once when i  woke up I thought aliens were abducting me (it felt VERY real), another  time people were surrounding me (including the inner feeling of someone  being near as well, I didn't just *see*  them I also felt their presence which was very very scary) and another  time I literally FELT someone holding me down in bed very forcibly.  

These were all extremely intense and unpleasant and exponentially worse  than any sleep paralysis episodes I have ever experienced. I *never* experience sleep paralysis at night either; it only occurs during the day for me during naps when I didn't sleep well the night before. But  this felt like a sleep paralysis bout on mega-steroids. 

The night was  absolutely terrifying. My friend also said this drug had limited  side-effects. I understand that I took it too late at night, but even then, with side-effects like that being possible I will NEVER take Propranolol again. Very traumatizing experience.

I just wanted to share this crazy story. It's very  ridiculous how strange some people's side-effects can be from commonly  prescribed medication...

it's been a few years now and i stopped taking drugs, life is better. i seem to always get what i want, i got a job, a flat, can sleep with any girl i want and i stopped getting mentally harassed by demons. i don't actually remember signing the contract but it feels like i sold my soul.

So theoretically could microdosing shrooms post MDMA trip help with the severity of the “come down”?

For me, this one time stands out in my mind. 15 years old, hanging around the local gas station because that's what we always did. Some guy drove up and asked if we wanted to buy some weed. Of course we did! I had $20 that I had saved up from doing chores. Being a kid with little experience, I gave the money up front. Dude said to hang on, and went into the gas station. I was confused as hell, wondering where the drugs are. I kept asking the people he was with ""where's the weed?!"". They just shrugged. Eventually the guy came out and I asked him, ""Where's my stuff?!"". He just kind of smiled and told me ""There might be cops, so I put it in the napkin dispenser inside."" I was like ""Awesome!"", grinning in anticipation of getting some sweet drugs.

Guy drove off. I went in to the store to find the weed. My dumb ass turned every single napkin dispenser inside out searching for this weed until the clerk got suspicious and asked me what the hell I was doing. Needless to say I never found the weed.

I did 5.5 grams. My now ex-boyfriend had the best intentions and was trying to cure my crippling depression with a high dose.

 The relationship was mentally abusive for reasons kind of out of his control. His life had gone in such an unfortunate way that he has borderline personality disorder and has not come to terms with how to help himself or deal with it. This relationship really brought me down in my already existing depression. I dont know if this explains it enough but yeah. It's all I really wanna say about it. 

We had been messing around with shrooms for a while by then. Taking them countless times at different doses each time. 
Obviously I wasnt cured instantly, or even at all. I'm still on SSRI's which I had stopped taking at that point. The shrooms I was consistently doing had convinced me that an all natural approach would be better, I was working out, seeing a naturopath, started following the paleo diet to the best of my ability. And I should probably mention I was smoking dabs all day every day. I was 21 and 80 ibs. I never left the house, I had anxiety attacks often, some days never made it out of bed, other days made it up to workout but that's pretty much it. I couldnt eat. Anytime I would get an appetite, something small would happen and it would instantly disappear. I knew my relationship wasnt healthy but I didnt see leaving as an option. I dont really know where this story is going so I'm sorry for it being scattered all over the place. 

This 5 gram dose was the most insane experience I've ever had. I've had really bad eyesight pretty much my whole life and wear thick glasses or contacts from the moment I wake up until bed time because I cant see more than 6inches past my face. So during this trip, that fact became more of a reality. I became completely blind, everything was black even though I had my eyes open and all I could see was tiny neon shapes in the distance. So I kept my eyes closed the whole time because the blackness was overwhelming and terrifying. 

I had this ritual of anytime I was tripping to fill a baggie full of air and this little bubble would be ""my problems"" so it was like I was holding all my problems in my hands and had control over them, then at the end of the trip I would pop the bag/ bubble, seemingly ""getting rid of my problems"". 
So for this trip I did the same but at one point this little bubble I was holding became big bubbles completely surrounding me,  I was even reaching up and trying to push the bubbles away from me a little because it was feeling claustrophobic. I was completely surrounded by my problems. It was horrible. 

Months after this trip, I still struggle to come to terms with what I experienced. Hence me writing this, trying to get it all out for good? And hopefully helping someone to put their experience into words because reading other people's stories have helped me to put my thoughts into cohesive sentences 😆 even though most people's stories make no sense to me, it's clear that everyones experience is completely different. 

Okay back to this particular trip.. where was I going....
At one point closer to the end, I was surrounded by darkness again and this time I was looking for ""light at the end of the tunnel"" and I remember having this thought ""I'm either going to commit suicide or I'm going to do the thing"" 
I need to mention that I was raised a Jehovahs Witness and was completely non active, I didnt want anything to do with it and pushed any of those ideas away. 
""The thing"" was what was bothering my conscience subconsciously. I was disobeying everything I had been taught. Why? Because I have depression. I finally understood. Depression made me feel like I wasnt good enough. I wasnt good enough so I might as well be ""bad"". 

Side note, kindof.  I started to try to ""unravel"" my depression like it was a tangled up piece of string.. and this started to make me believe that something had happened to me. I was convinced that somebody in my family had done something to me and that I had blocked out the memory and that's why I have depression. A couple days later it was clear to me that this was all a lie but this lie stuck with me for a little while and really bothered me that my brain even went to that extreme and it scared me to think about what my life wouldve turned out to be if I had believed this lie. My own brain had come up with this lie though to try to explain my depression. So I guess it helped me come to terms that nothing had happened to me to make me this way. It's just the way I am, I didnt need to explain it to myself or anybody else. I just accepted that I would need meds for the rest of life and that was okay. It didnt make me weak, or crazy or that I needed a ""cure"" or anything else that I had been told. I didnt have a start to my depression because I grew up with it from day one. 

Another realization was that I hopped from relationship to relationship in order to feel something. Literally have had boyfriends consistently since 5th grade. (Dont give your kids phones guys!!!) I was 21 and I had lived with 3 men. With little as 2-3 months between relationships. I didnt care what I felt, as long as it wasnt emptiness. I thought being in a relationship was the only way I was going to be happy, keeping that as my main focus, and kept getting disappointed of course. It was my coping mechanism. But I was always comparing my relationships to my very first love and clung to any part of the particular person I was with that resembled my first love. My first love always came back around into my life for a little bit until I found a new ""muse"". Then he'd get pissed and say horrible things to me and we'd block each other until the next time. An awful cycle, I know. 

Realization #3 I was addicted to dabs in order to ignore reality. My reality sucked. I was not who I wanted to be and my life was not where I wanted it to be, but it seemed good to the viewpoint of other people so I stuck with it and smoked to ignore my own feelings. I was so addicted that they stopped affecting me. I'd smoke a half gram dab, and be totally comprehensive? Idk if that's the right word. I was a fry-brain to put it that way 🤪 
I was a party show! Anytime we'd have friends over itd be like ""watch this! She can smoke all of you under the table!"" 
It was rediculous really.
But it makes sense. Before dabs it was alcohol. I was an alcoholic starting in highschool. But then this particular boyfriend would always take advantage of my drunken state so I quit drinking out of fear and immediately turned to smoking. Anything to ignore reality. 


I realized that the relationship I was in and the lifestyle choices I was making was making my depression 1000x worse. I accepted that I wanted to be a Jehovahs Witness, I accepted that even though I would mess up it would be okay and I would be forgiven and all I had to was just try. Try my best and that would be good enough. My best was good enough. Even if my best didnt compare to somebody else. Woah. That was a life changer right there. 

So I guess the goal of ""curing me"" with a high dose worked, in a way that he did not expect. In the words of Ariana Grande.. thank you.. next. 

I left the relationship, and it was the hardest thing I'd ever done. I had to trust in my God for the first time to take care of me, and he did because I was finally doing the right thing. I had no money. Literally zero dollars. I hadn't worked in over a year. But everything worked out. I stopped smoking dabs almost instantly, I started working in my career again, successfully this time. Found a new place to live, a new place to work, new friends, new family, a new support system. Truly living my best life. 
I'm happily single for the longest I have ever been 😆 and I'm looking forward to being single for however long, I dont care, I only care about working on myself and being the kind of person that would be deserving of an amazing person doing the same thing. Eventually, not now. If I want a strong, healthy relationship, I need to be what I expect of the other person, if that makes sense. 

All of this was already inside me but it probably wouldve taken years to figure out instead of a day because of the shrooms. The best way I can explain it, is your thoughts are made reality so that you can really focus on them and figure them out faster than if you werent on shrooms. 
But doing shrooms made me realize I never want to do shrooms again 🤣 

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk

We ate them and we smoke some joints, I was so nervous waiting to feel all the things that I read about the mushrooms. When I started to feel the efects it was awesome, I felt very comfortable with all my friends and the environment was simply magic.

I ask this question because I have panic disorder involving daily, sometimes multiple times daily panic attacks and severe insomnia due to the panic attacks. 

I am prescribed to klonopin twice daily to treat my panic attacks. But I have never been told, “You can’t drive anymore if you take klonopin daily,” by my psychiatrist and I don’t believe that I am intended to never drive because I take this drug daily. The prescription bottle simply says, “use caution when operating heavy machinery,” NOT, “do not operate heavy machinery.” If I were to be pulled over, I wouldn’t be arrested for DWI having taken my prescribed klonopin dose. Klonopin, in my opinion, has far stronger psychoactive and physical affects than marijuana. 

Now I also have a medical marijuana prescription to treat my anxiety and insomnia. In the spirit of full disclosure, I also smoke during the day recreationally here and there. When I pick up weed from the dispensary, the prescription label doesn’t have directions, rather just the amounts of the different types of cannabinoids. If I were to be pulled over after having smoked, would that be considered driving under the influence, subjecting me to getting arrested, if I am under the influence of a substance like klonopin that I am prescribed to?

Everytime I got high I had a great time with no problems.

When quarantine started and I realized I was gonna be stuck home for a few months so I decided I'm gonna buy a dab pen to have some fun. So I got high off it every other night with no problems then it ran out so I threw it away. 

After quarantine ended and I started going out again, everytime I smoke my mouth gets unbelievably dry to the point where I can't feel my mouth or tongue. It just feels pure static, the most fucked up feeling ever. I have to keep drink water to get a quick feeling of my mouth again but only for a few secs then it goes back to me not being able to feel anything. That goes on for about 40 mins. Was outside the 1st time after quarantine when it happened too without water so had to frickin sprint and drink from a pond. Yesterday was my 4th time smoking and it still happens. Tried different weed, different people, different dab pens. Tried eating/drinking before, during, after. 

Idk what to do now I'm fine sober but I really wanna smoke again but that feeling is beyond fucked up and it doesn't seem like it's going away. Idk what caused it or how to treat it.

Anyone else relate to this?

I have blackout memory although apparently I still function when this happens, I easy spend $500 on a night out, I've had the cops refer me to a drug and alcohol clinic multiple times, I actively avoid going out to dinner near my favourite clubs cause I cant seem to trust myself not to drink and once I've started its like I'm possessed constantly back at the bar double shot bourbon and coke 20+ drinks. I hate who I am when I drink and I hate that once I taste it I cant seem to stop myself, and dont get me wrong I have self control over things like food. Even drugs I'll admit I have abused a lot and often but I can have them in the house and forget theyre there or wait until I want to use them if I want to, and I can really pace myself and know when Ive reached my limit (occasionally push the limits but thats more experimental) compared to alcohol where it feel like once I start drinking I'm not satisfied until I'm unconscious waking up in hospital with an IV drip terrified of how I got there, how I've treated people, and terrified of having 0 memory. I only recently realised that not everyone has this uncontrollable relationship with alcohol when my friend said that she remembers every night out we've had and I was genuinely shocked because I remember none.

\+4: Reduction in euphoria, but anxiolysis and relaxed state still persists. I have anxiety, so talking to people is WAY easier. Now listening to The Offspring.

And to put it simply I couldn't finish it, like I was not CAPABLE of finishing it. At maybe 1/3 of the mix I just threw my headset, shut everything down and went in my bed (knowing perfectly sleeping wouldn't be possible at all).

While I was laying on my bed, I felt the most powerful feelings possible: I felt like a juggernaut going over lightspeed across the multiverse, destroying everything in my path, with the deep sensation existence itself was collapsing and I would never BE again.

During this time I met my friends and family, and like me they knew damn well all this was real and they kept asking what the hell was going on. What I figured during my trip was that these interactions were being done in a MUCH higher state of consciousness, and that only I would be able to feel and remember it, because the others weren't on shrooms.

All my senses were in complete synesthesia with each other while I was tripping, all of them. I also tried to take notes during my trip, here's what I wrote:

""It's like I have it right in front of me, surrounding me, this endless maze. I managed to escape it like every shrooms user have.

The fact that I have two friends where one is an alcoholic that drinks from morning until night and the other who is on his way to becoming like the rest of the group that I was telling you guys about is what always prevented me from drinking.

**For the past year, I have been curious to see how it is and couldn’t stand it anymore**, so I got a 400 mL bottle of Tsipouro that I believe was 40% ABV. I went to work and killed time until I could go home to drink it. Leaving work – I usually work four hours but I hit eight hours on the weekends – I said to myself, “What the heck, a little sip couldn’t hurt” and drank some – the award for idiocy and utter nonsense belongs to the me - . I like it immediately and start to drink at the rate that only a quarter of the bottle is remaining. I go towards the square, there six girls have come across an injured cat and are waiting for animal control to pick it up. The scene seems interesting to me and I start to watch them.

Meanwhile, half an hour has passed, and the Tsipouro has hit me and I am smashed. I am seeing everything as a huge party now. Suddenly the night is wonderful, everyone is friendly, the lights are blinking like I’m at some club and I am sociable for the first time in my life. An acquaintance passes by and I try to explain to him that, while I’m not an alcoholic, I drink a little Tsipouro from time to time – I don’t know why I said this I was totally drunk – but I start to want a cigarette. I see a discarded cigarette on the ground and I go up to a huge bald guy that is chilling with his motorbike in the square – spoiler: he didn’t beat me up – and I ask him for a light.

The guy lights my cigarette and gives me another one as he strikes up a conversation with me. He starts telling me something about databases and how he managed to teach himself and then he was telling me about how I can work out at home and “don’t make the mistake of getting a personal trainer.” Then I start spilling my guts to this guy – you don’t have the best ideas while drunk, but thankfully I didn’t tell him anything super personal, just things like “I’m afraid I’ll die a virgin” and stuff – and he was telling me about “the [Marble King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_XI_Palaiologos), that we are living at the end of the age of sin, and he will rise up and save Greece” and about “the prophecies of the wise old men on Mount Athos” and how **“women are asking for it, that’s why they are raped, men aren’t to blame.”** **This guy is a brainiac**, but I was listening to him like I listen to a **conspiracy theorist.** He leaves after asking me if I want to go to a brothel with him – thank God I didn’t say yes – and I go straight home. By the way, **the guy was telling me that the kids I had issues with in the village are his friends and asked me if I know them, but thankfully he cut me off and said no.**

On the street, everything seemed gorgeous. The bars along Venizelos street seemed like they were in some exotic corner of New Orleans, and the cars like they were paper and my body felt fucking amazing. I went home – I think I ran into my father but right now I don’t remember exactly – and promptly laid down… suddenly I had the amazing idea of “let’s get some pills!”- five 50 miligrams lyrica pills if someone knows what this thing could do to me please tell me -  and I put my idea in motion.

My mom came to my room – she came up to see about something else but saw that I was hammered and sat down to chat – and I started to tell her what I hadn’t told her for so long, that I didn’t want children or to get married, that I hate my job and my life and how I want to to travel all over  Europe on foot. Then I went and threw up everything, **and even this seemed fun to me at that moment, thankfully it cleansed me.**

Right now I feel terrible – play shitty games, win shitty prizes – with an intense hangover but at least I have lost the desire to see how it feels to be drunk.

TLDR: I was drunk for the first time in my life, talked about my love life with a degenerate who knew the guys who used to bully me, ran into some girls who were trying to save a cat, and told my mom things that I’ve wanted to tell her for a long time.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,691751,public,confidence,self,Hey !

I could become good at this game just being sober, but I really think that it would take a lot longer, and I would not realize/see things the way I do now.  


I've been tripping on a 100ug tab of LSD everyday for the last several weeks. I discovered last year that LSD has opened the door for me to become very good at a certain game.  When that happened, I started off by just tripping once a week, then eventually I started tripping twice a week. i.e 100ug on Tuesday, 400ug on Saturday  


**Fast forward to like 3 weeks ago:** I'm now at a point where I take 100ug a day, play my game for 8 hours, grind, do my routines, and I can feel my abilities getting stronger by the day. My game IQ has skyrocketed, and for this reason I continue to take 100ug..I feel like I'm gaining new abilities at a crazy rate, from constantly being under the influence of this drug.  


It might be the LSD making me delusional (I don't think so though), but I really think that I'll make it as a pro likely by the end of the year.  


You know how there have been problem solving experiments done using LSD? I really look at this as the same. From being a guy who was not good at the game at all, to eventually cracking the code and going straight to the top.

  
Don't most people who play action games like counter-strike and so forth, deep down would love it if they were pro at the game? But they know they won't be, and they accept that - and play on a casual level. But now, you start taking LSD and to your amazement, you are getting insanely good at this game. You never even thought you could be good at this. I notice that even when I don't take it, I'm still good / fast at the game. So I feel like my **reflexes** and **reaction time** are becoming insane.  


**Here are my questions:**

1. Has anyone taken this much LSD per day, if so what can you tell me about that experience?
2. If you have not, but know a lot about what would happen to a person taking 100ug daily, have any thoughts?
3. Has anyone used LSD to learn or go on some learning expedition?
4. I have wondered what would happen by taking this much lsd daily? I mean its been one hell of a ride. I get to enjoy music on another level, play my fav game, and steadily get better and better at it.. Pretty insane stuff.
5. Would I achieve the same thing by microdosing, and is perhaps the 100ug not necessary?  


**Side Effects**

Along the way, I have become pretty passionate about my journey in this game. It's made me pretty emotional at times, or neurotic. It's made me very steadily focused on this one goal. It's almost like my life mission. I notice I've become uninterested in many things - to some extent. I still work and all that of course.  


I have not experienced hppd or anything. The most has been some auto immune related flare ups, but it hasn't been too bad. Dunno if my body just got used to this or what?  


I understand that it's a bit risky doing this everyday. As foolish as it sounds, you could say that's how badly I want to make it pro, how much this journey means to me.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,691719,public,confidence,self,Taking LSD daily to accelerate learning - Honest advice/feedback.,0,[],0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hlratl/taking_lsd_daily_to_accelerate_learning_honest/,no_ads,0.0,1594001863.0,,,,,,1593973563.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Worst one is meth, it made me really awake, and legit made my brain freeze, i couldn’t even think of anything, the comedown is the WORST, i was panicking for a week after using, even though i did very little (i had to take it because we spent over 36 hours awake and raving, then we had to catch our flight on the same day)

The ones i wouldn’t do are coke after hearing what it does to your nose and ofc heroin, meth was on this list but alas, i already tried it.

Phenethylamines can be fun but the visuals are all very similar and they tend not to have as much headspace, that being said I still rate 2cb, bromo dragonfly, mescaline, MDMA, MDA and others. If it wasn’t for MDMA I would prefer dissos 

Tryptamine’s are the best imo with psilocybin, LSD, DMT an all the other elites. They provide the the most intense psychedelic experience and are best for self reflection and finding new perspectives, I almost see them non recreationally as I find them to intense for recreational environments

Dissos are unique but there’s not very many of them available, nos is an all round insane especially when combined with other stuff and Ket is pretty fun. I think dissos are best combined with other substances though, not to say that on their own their lack lustre but that their full potential is when combined

Deliriant’s are kinda shit (accept ambien that’s kind off fun but more of a Benzo) although they still provide insane experiences but have too many negatives comedowns, dry mouth, bodyload, confusion, dysphoria, etc. Although I’m sure some people some people enjoy them (mostly people who can’t get real psychs tho)

Also what does Slavia fit into ? And is there a fifth sub category  of hallucinogens ? as I consider cannabinoids to be hallucinogens

I’m 18m and I’m about to leave for college in a few weeks

So here’s the situation. I indulge in a couple drugs. Nicotine, weed, and gabapentin. I smoke and vape all the time and I came across gabapentin a couple years ago when I was still experimenting with shit. I kinda fucked with it and I like things that are relatively low risk. Since then, I do it every few months if I’m dankrupt or something. Most of the time I forget about they’re existence and go about my day.

  A week ago my dad had gotten home early from a trip while I was away visiting some family. He decided to clean up in my room and he found my stash of gaba. Now he thinks I pop pills all the time and that I’m addicted to gaba and he wants to send me to rehab for it. He told me he’s not helping me with college unless I go so I guess I have no choice. I just wanted some advice/tips on going to rehab (for someone who isn’t abusing the substance they’re there for)

After a year long forced break due to probation, I cannot smoke any more than the smallest hit without getting incredibly anxious, and experiencing horrible physical sensations. 

A little while back, my fiancé’s cousin offered me a dab. We were staying at their place, and I thought “this is such a relaxed environment, I have no pressures, I’ll be able to hit a dab and just chill out.” I was very wrong. Shortly after blowing out a cloud (dude gave me a pea-sized chunk) I became incredibly nervous, and a frightened, panicky, animal fear came over me. I was consumed with thoughts of conspiracy, government plots, and my own self-destructive tendencies. 
I had to excuse myself to go lay down, and as I lay down my entire body began to shake uncontrollably. The vibrations came from my chest, and worked their way out through my arms and legs. I tried unsuccessfully for about 2 hours to relax my muscles, but was completely incapable. The only thing I was capable of doing was lying there and convulsing. At some point a thought occurred to me that it felt like the chemical was taking me apart and putting me back together one cell at a time. I have never had an experience like this. The intensity of the experience was comparable to some sort of psychedelic drug. At some point I fell asleep, I know this only because roughly 6 hours after initially smoking the dab, I woke up. I felt more or less myself again, no convulsions, no delusions. I felt like a new man, and I felt a sense of accomplishment in having gotten through the experience (much like how I feel the day after a heavy trip). I feel I gained a new understanding of my mental processes, and 100% got a good look at my internal fear mechanism, and how I ramp myself up as soon as I get a little nervous.

anyway so we got this bag of tan crystals amongst a white-ish powder and started snorting. it was around 8 pm. honestly thank god it wasnt molly bc the amount we were ingesting probably wouldve killed us bc we had no idea about dosing. it was the worst drip ive ever experienced, it was so bad it made me vomit - purely from the taste, not bc the effects of the drug. 

we kept waiting for the come up... but it just never happened. an hour went by and we decided well maybe we just need more. more time passed, and we all felt very UP and speedy, but there was no euphoria or giddiness that you experience with molly. we were all also talking uncontrollably fast. sometimes i wouldnt even realize i was talking, i legit thought to myself once ""whats that noise i keep hearing..."" then realized it was words coming out of my mouth!!! 

my friends kept doing it, but i decided to stop since i had no idea what it was and knew at this point it certainly wasnt mdma. idk how much i had exactly, but if i had to guess probably somewhere around 800mgs, maybe more. about an hour and a half after i quit dosing i started to come down. i felt tired and depressed. we were at a club and i just was not into at all. i felt ill and clammy and EXTREMELY thirsty. 

as time went on these symptoms increased. i was coming down but my friends were still going. they seemed irrational and out of it. i felt so horrible and awful, i cant even explain it. i have never been so thirsty in my entire life. i drank so much water that i felt sick. like my stomach was on 120% capacity of straight water and i was still PARCHED. every little thing was affecting me deeply and seemed so awful (sorta reminiscent of a bad acid trip). as the hours passed it just got worse. i started to feel extremely weak, like i could barely move and i lost my voice. my heart felt weak and shaky, but i could feel it beating through my whole body. when i spoke, it was very slow and in between breaths, and my voice was barely audible. while i was going through this, my two friends were fucking for a couple hours in the other room. idk how they managed such an act on this shit tho.

i felt like i was dying. even though i felt weak and tired, sleeping was not on the horizon. i started watching shameless to help pass the time and it felt so impactful, like the way it feels to watch a show or movie while youre tripping. i started to feel a little better as the sun started to come up. with each passing hour i felt slightly better. i got my voice back, but i still felt awful. i felt like i needed to shit, but i couldnt. i kept trying but nothing. finally i was able to get a little something out... and once that happened i felt significantly improved. still shitty, but better. my friends woke up. one of them felt the same as me, she felt like she was dying and had no voice. our other friend felt fine. he said he felt a little tired but that was it. i finally was able to nap around 4 pm the next day. i felt shitty for a week+ after. 

ive tried googling what it is but i always just get a list of various uppers. i know it was clearly an upper... but what exactly i dont know. i used to think it was meth, but from all my readings it seems that meth causes intense euphoria, and none of us felt euphoric on that shit. we just felt very up and tweaky. 

anybody have any solid ideas on what this drug couldve been? i know it was a while ago, but i still just wonder. id appreciate it. 

tl;dr did a mystery drug that i thought was molly. no euphoria, just felt speedy for a couple hours. had the worst come down of my life that lasted 18+ hours. extremely parched, weak and shaky, lost my voice, felt like i was dying, couldnt sleep. i still felt slight effects in the following weeks. any idea what it couldve been?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,691595,public,confidence,self,can anybody help me identify which hard drug i did?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hlntia/can_anybody_help_me_identify_which_hard_drug_i_did/,no_ads,0.0,1593989384.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since I've taken it, my:

Psoriasis has calmed down, my anxiety is lower whilst on kratom, my depression has minimized while on kratom, my suicide thoughts are smaller while on kratom and my back pain has gotten easier to deal with and I shower with a kratom soap which has helped me with acne, overproductive sweat and has smoothen out my skin. It has helped me with my ADHD. I'm able to focus on things, hence why I'm even able to write this.

Negative effects: None. I've noticed no negative effect at all. I'm someone that easily gets addicted to things and I don't feel any addicted to kratom at all, might be because I take it so few times and because I only take 2.5g per dose, but still.

Why isn't Kratom used more widely in healthcare? It's literally a miracle drug. I wanted to take my life, held a knife to my throat, and was ready, but I took one last minute to give Kratom a shot, and now I don't even think about it but feel much calmer and productive. It doesn't make me sloppy or anything like THC can. What I mentioned above about the knife has happened so many times, and every time I take Kratom it saves me.

**(BTW I'm working on my struggles, so let's not focus on them, let's focus on why the hell our healthcare gives out dangerous drugs like oxy or fentanyl and not Kratom)**

It's used widely in Asia. When I was in Thailand last year, I visited some step-family I have there that is Thai and we went to ""Thai"" markets, where foreigners don't go and wow. It's not legal there but it's sold everywhere because everyone uses it. Their government can't regulate it because literally every second vendor is selling Kratom behind the counter.

I was researching this about a week ago and as always, I searched this subreddit for posts about it to see if it had any recreational potential. For those who don't know this substance, It's an NRI (norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) that's less effective than stimulants for ADHD yet less addictive.

Thing is, On almost every thread people commented saying it sucks and has 0 recreational value and is all in all a useless drug.

Now while I'm all for using drugs recreationally, This one I wasn't planning to, I legitimately wanted to mute down the brain fog preventing me from focusing on anything (and I live somewhere where I can buy such meds without scripts). I took 20 mgs daily (therapeutic dose) and I didn't expect to feel anything, Just hoped for some cognitive enhancement a couple of weeks later.

And unexpectedly, From the first time I took it I felt quite good. I'd describe it as dopamine-like euphoria that's strangely not stimulating. Good stuff; Sociability, Enhanced music appreciation, Enhanced sex drive, Cognitive euphoria, Motivation, None of the stimmy jitters. Those effects even increased day after another.

IDK if my brain chemistry is too different, And no it's not as recreational as amphetamine, And I'm not sure if it's worth the hassle of trying to get a script or to get it other hard ways, But for an easily available drug it's pretty good, Good functional drug for poli addicts. IDK why many people say it's shitty.

And I understand it. I really do. When I was a teenager, I had all sorts of negative emotions. I was abused, I hated myself, and I didn’t know how to do deal with these problems. 

So I turned to drugs like marijuana and alcohol at first to help cope with the feelings. And honestly it did make me feel good. That was only at first though. 

Eventually I became a shell of a person. I started drinking heavily and when that wasn’t enough to numb my feelings, I switched to harder substances. I wanted to be a better person but I didn’t know how to start. 

And you wanna know what I did? Heroin. That was the solution that I felt comfortable with to fix my problems. And I wish I could say things are different now, but I’m deep into this shit and I don’t see a way out. 

Use drugs to enhance life, not to make it the sole reason why it’s good. You can’t live just to get high and escape. You’ll end up like me, a shell of a person that just wakes up to get high and live in a fantasy world that doesn’t exact exist. 

Do things you love. There’s a lot of stuff in this world and you can take steps to find what’s meaningful to you. Work on that and work on building yourself, don’t end up like me.

Since she was moving in to the apartment right next to me she was asking me about where the gas pipes were in the walls - well I certainly knew where my gas pipe was, but I had no idea where were the ones she was talking about. So I started examining my apartment, doing exactly what she asked me to do and by the end of it I felt like a champ - helped 2/2 my neighbours which gave me an opportunity to blast my stereo without getting police called on me(again), got high and drunk, had a great time with my friends and slept like a baby that night - 10/10.

I had used salvia once (think it was x10 extract) and broke through. Was pretty terrifying and amazing at the same time , at least looking back at it. I have plenty of experience with 2CB, LSD, Shrooms, MDMA, Weed - only psychedelic i didnt try is dmt and those rc stuffs.

So now im thinking would it enhance or be worth trying a low dose of salvia on one of those substances? I dont wanna break through, i just wanna take a lower dose of a extract to see what it does on a psychedelic , was thinking of 2cb since its more euphoric and gentle than lsd or shrooms. Or maybe mdma? The salvia would last just for maximum half - 1 hour in total, not speaking of the peak effects, so maybe on the comeup?

Would appreciate any advice or even better if someone could tell from their own experience.

but you do realize there are some people out there who really, really need things to slow down for a bit, right ? like actually needing it, just to not be zoned out or freak out.( without any prior substance abuse btw. just naturally having a burst of intrusive thougths about your own/your close ones' well beings.)

there are thousands of people out there who are inherently(probably not inherently but thats not the point, you get the point) anxious about something they are not even aware of who also like to indulge in drugs.but their fight ot flight response just get triggered for god knows what; and these people are prescribed benzos because benzos, when used properly, are some life-saving shit for them; because whenever they feel like some life threatening shit is about to happen, they know they can pop 0.5-1 mg of xanax and be semi-okay. even having this notion that they can be safe after popping 0.5 mg prevents them from actually using it. not talking about recreational regular usage here, just on an as-needed basis.


knowing that you have a solution to your anxiety will make you not need that solution, because it's always there. you always know there is a legal get out of jail free card; which will ironically make you not use them, you get what i'm trying to say; just having something in your disposal that will scientifically calm your dumbass down means you can hold on to it without using it because it's mere existence gives you this sense of security.

so, what the fuck is is with you antagonizing benzos like once you touch em youre fucked and gonna die of seizures? 

when you talk like that, do you mean people who recreationally pop 2mg bars just for the fuck of it, or do you mean people who use benzos because it actually enables them to function when they are having one of those absolutely fucked up episodes? 

if you believe in the latter, do you have any other healthier replacements that will actually help those people,  and are also available to your average drug user with some connections?

and IF NOT, what do you suggest people with severe panic/anxiety disorder do ? apart from alcohol for fun and xanax to survive the day ?

since these gaba agonists are believed to be diabolical around here, what do you suggest people with severe anxiety do?

PS. Been using xanax for around 5 years. not daily, but on an as-needed basis. .5-1mg once every two days depending on the situation. i'm open to all kinds of suggestions.  it just has to be some safe-well known shit since xanax is the mother of all sins here. as long as i can replace xans with something less harmful. i can find it. 

so, how do I get rid of random - seemingly life-threatining- bursts of anxiety without xanax since they seem to be a highway to absolute hell.

I got put on mood stabilizers (lamictal and seroquel) but still had occasional manic episodes and long periods of depression. A while ago I went off of mood stabilizers and quit all drugs other than alcohol and Xanax. 

Even tho I’ve been off mood stabilizers i haven’t had a manic episode in I’d say like 9 months and have just been depressed, now I’m wondering if my mania was all drug induced and I’m not really bipolar.

They’re coming from an “all drugs are bad perspective” and it just goes to show the ignorance that’s spread mainly by government funded programs, in which capitalism is a big motivator.

So here’s my argument: where do you draw the line? Tylenol is a drug, and surely Tylenol isn’t bad. What makes Tylenol different than heroin? Obviously a lot. But what’s the factor that makes Tylenol fine and heroin bad? I mean, they’re both mind-altering painkillers. Well one argument would be that Tylenol is not addictive while heroin is very addictive. So how about codeine cough syrup vs. morphine, a drug very similar to heroin? They’re both prescription opioids. Are they both bad? Surely not because they’re prescribed by a doctor, right? We’ll just ignore the fact that prescription opioids, while incredibly effective, are a major catalyst for heroin addiction. My point is, every drug has its pros and cons.

Drug abstinence programs is school taught us that mushrooms would make you see purple giraffes and if you touched them you’d become an addict. They never taught us about the dangers of prescription drugs, nor the therapeutic benefits of psychedelics. Or that mushrooms are statistically the safest recreational drug out there.

Another one is that everyone sees alcohol as completely normal. I mean, it’s legal right? How bad could alcohol be? How about we talk about the fact that alcohol is the fourth most addictive drugs just after crack cocaine? But no, mushrooms are the bad guys. Mushrooms are illegal.

After preaching all that abstinence, addicts are treated with no dignity. Addicts have a hard time getting the help they need. Because they “shouldn’t have done drugs in the first place.” Which leads me to circle back to an earlier point I made, that prescription opioids have quite the risk of addiction. So what’s this contradiction? All drugs are bad unless they’re prescribed even if the prescribed drug leads to addiction?

Just some food for thought. I figured I’d let it out to a group of people that might understand more.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,691537,public,confidence,self,Drugs are bad,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hlhzxe/drugs_are_bad/,no_ads,0.0,1593959156.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I probably have done too many drugs for my age but i love them and use them responsibly 

Weed: (First time) 10/10 Nonstop laughing and a clean euphoria, Everything is interesting and food is godlike and sleep even better. 
Weed: (tolerance) 4/10 Small buzz that lasts for 30 minutes and can be relaxing or anxiety inducing, ruins sleep, food is better but nothing like the first time, can make you lazy. Also adds onto most drugs like LSD, MDMA, Alcohol, Baclofen, DXM, Shrooms, Opiates, Benzodiazepines and Stimulants.

LSD: 10/10 Best hallucinogen ive tried, Never had a bad trip on this stuff, Amazing visuals and a amazing headspace where everything is full of wonder and euphoria, Lasts for 12 hours  peaks for 4 and some combos with this drug are godlike. Music is great and lsd is very profound. And is easier to control than mushrooms.

MDMA: 10/10 The most amazing feeling ive ever felt in my life. Pure euphoria and bliss and energy. Music on it is incomparable to other drugs. Only thing is cant sleep after and comedown isnt that fun but not terrible but way worth it for the high

DPH: 0/10 possibly the worst drug ive consumed. True hallucinations are nothing to fuck with impossible to tell from reality, like in a dream where everything is nonsensical but you believe everything thats delirium on dph but instead it being as vivid as a dream its as vivid as reality. The audio hallucinations are the same thing it might as well be a schizophrenia simulator. And when you go above 700mg you get all encompassing hallucinations that are also as vivid as reality and they are some of the most nightmarish things ive ever seen.

Salvia: ?/10 I have no clue what to rank this i had a sub breakthrough on it that terrified the shit out of me and made me think i was dying but gave me some of the most beautiful visuals ive ever seen. This stuff is not to be fucked with.

DMT 8/10 Even though it made me nauseated as hell it gave me some of the best tryptamine visuals ive had. A Breakthrough on this stuff would definitely be extremely profound and possibly life changing. But can give you ptsd if a bad trip.

Shrooms: 9/10 Lasts half the length of lsd but is very peaceful and amazing visuals. Amazing headspace along with it but harder to control than lsd. Also amazing afterglow and is also profound.

Oxycodone: 8/10 Very relaxing, euphoric, blissful, warm, simple. Just eat a pill and you’re chilling for a few hours and sleep feels amazing and no comedown. But it is very addictive because of this aspect.

Hydrocodone: 7/10 Basically oxycodone but less intense.

Oxymorphone: 9/10 Basically oxycodone but much better and more addictive from this aspect.

Xanax: 4/10 Great relaxation and no anxiety but blackouts are fucking terrible.

Klonopin: 8/10 Longer anxiety relief, more muscle relaxation, great sleep, and lasts 3x as long as xanax.

Temazepam: 9/10 Anxiety destroyer, muscle relaxation to the max, and amazing sleep.

Alcohol: 6/10 Good combo drug and if no other drugs available comes in clutch. Good relaxation, decent anxiety reducer and sleep is good. But the downsides are if you drink too much you get the spins and throw up constantly or if you dont spin then you can drink to blackouts and or overdose. And is terrible for your body as it destroys your liver. And you become very irritable.

Nitrous oxide: 4/10 Good high peacefulness, bliss, euphoria and no pain but lasts a solid 30 seconds to a minute and if you do it often b12 deficiency is horrible.

DXM: 9/10 Amazing high and hallucinations and music is second to mdma, Great afterglow but for me it gives me panic attacks half the time and hot flashes and it tastes fucking horrible if cough meds and much nausea.

Ketamine: 8/10 Great peacefulness and hallucinations and a good comedown and afterglow but if used often your kidneys or bladder will just quit on you.

Valium: 7/10 Lots of muscle relaxation but half the anxiety reduction from xanax, But lasts longer than xanax.

Nicotine: 6/10 Good with other drugs and helps stress and anxiety but once used a lot the buzz disappears and you’re just killing yourself if you continue. 

Adderall: 6/10 addictive as fuck but good high and social but lacks the warmth and emotion of mdma. Very very energetic too.

Baclofen: 7/10 Decent euphoria and muscle relaxation and good sleep with no comedown.

Ambien: 3/10 made me anxious and hallucinate slightly good for sleep though.

400ug LSD and 150mg MDMA and Nos: 100/10 this combo gave me the most profound and amazing visuals and feelings ive ever had. Shifting through dimensions and ego death was so crazy and i love it. Easily my favorite combo so far. Pure love, euphoria, empathy and bliss. Hard as hell to sleep after though.

50mg Benadryl and Alcohol and Opiates and Weed: 10/10 Amazing euphoria relaxation and bliss like oxycodone but enhanced a lot. This is the same with hydrocodone and oxymorphone so i dont have to type it out. Plus 0 comedown and even a afterglow.

Alcohol and Weed: 8/10 Great combo if dosed enough to not spin. Just relaxation and euphoria and no anxiety. Nicotine goes great with it too

Baclofen and Weed: 9/10 Cant spin  and adds to baclofen euphoria and makes it much better. Relaxation, euphoria, sleep all of it is great. Nicotine is also good on this combo.

Adderall and Weed: 8/10 Makes the weed high very clearheaded and makes everything more euphoric.

Nos and LSD: 10/10 Great combo too just flings you into another dimension with amazing euphoria and sometimes ego death.

In conclusion i really like drugs and combos and will keep doing them with all harm reduction practices.

I had improve my friendships and relationships with people and have this weird sense of power I can pick up people emotions and see things in different perspective.

This sounds crazy but I was chronic asthmatic before my bad lsd trip, after that I haven’t had to use my inhaler at all but mostly cause anxiety was trigger for my asthma.

My career has definitely improved aswell by securing a promotion which was very unexpected.

LSD has honestly saved my life. I feel this great energy and never been so happy with life and I stopped being so negative and I didn’t even noticed how negative I used to be.

I’m so thankful for psychedelics and I enjoy the roller coaster ride. I hope you can see the good and positive from all your trips.

Also it killed my appetite, which is a positive for me. Had about 4-5 hours of clean mental clarity and motivation and drive, followed by another 4-5 hours of residual stimulation.

It's different that caffeine in the way that it doesn't feel jittery and instead comes with this calm, focus mental clarity with a sprinkle of drive and motivation. Exceeded my expectations.

I've been using Oxy for about a year. Basically came across about 3500 10mg capsules (yes, the ones with lovely powder inside, yum) and started slow until I got to about 100 - 140mg a day. Can't really say what kind of experience it was, but definitely blurry. 

Recently ran out but I came across some fentanyl patches 50mcg per hour. They stick to your skin and give you 3 days of a somewhat normal life per patch. I don't feel euphoria but I'm not having withdrawals from oxy either. I know the patches are stronger and stopping them is harder than stopping oxy but I came to an end of the oxys quite suddenly and I hesitated. I thought I might die of withdrawals. 

Now I've decreased the patch dosages to 37.5mcg per hour in attempt to stop the patches completely. The first day is going ok. Still no withdrawals....

.....HOWEVER, when I first started the patches I started getting these horrible aches and pains of what might be early onset arthritis, disk in my back and a damaged nerve causing numbness in one leg. The pain is now limiting my daily activities and I'm in bed most of the day but not getting any sleep whatsoever. The pain is so bad and I have severe insomnia.

My worry is, did I develop this while on the oxy and therefore the pain has been controlled/hidden all this time? 

Now that I've stopped the oxys, if i go to the doctors about these current problems and pains will he give me oxy 10s straight away if I tell him the whole truth? Will he take into account that I have high tolerance? How long will I have to live with this pain?

Not sure what to feel right now, but it's almost daybreak where I am now and I haven't slept in 2 days. I feel like getting so high but I have nothing but Fentanyl patches which I don't dare to abuse. Way to many fatalities from fent abuse.

I dosed for the first time like 24h ago and I feel like I have to write down a trip report and all the conclusions I extracted from my roll, because I feel really rejuvenated and with many things clearer than before (maybe hangover fucks this up tomorrow haha)

First of all: excuse my broken english, it's been a long time since I wrote something this long and I've never been really confident about my writing skills, so tell me if I'm doing this right, I'll try to use google translator as little as possible.

Context: I'm in a rave with some friends, everyone of them have rolled before and were rolling with me at the moment. My gf, who I'm with for six months, wasn't having a good night (she was at home, and we're in a long-distance relationship, but we get to see each other like once or twice a month). I just got my IT degree, in which I've put a lot of efforts to get it, so I was lowkey proud of myself but not too much. 

T-0:00: I dosed around 1:00 am, a quarter of a pill a friend of us sold me (it was 360 mg so I took ~80mg). My friends also took a quarter of the same pill, so everyone dosed around the same. I drank a little bit before that, so I expected not to have a strong roll.

T-0:15: I started to feel energized. I started to walk around, as it's impossible for me to sit down. The entactogenic effect is not really present at this point tho.

T-0:30: I felt really energized, but at this point I could sit down, though I felt a bit dizzy whenever I stopped from moving. I started feeling the entactogenic effects, and it was so easy for me to speak with people I didn't know (i'm really shy). I felt really confident talking with a friend (I'm calling her M) I wasn't really confident with, and we were talking like if we were long-lasting friends!

T-0:45: I sat down next to a friend (I'll call him D), and I told him I was really thirsty and dizzy, so I asked him if we could go for some water, and to just walk around for a while. I was really missing my girlfriend at this point, so I hugged another friend (I'll call him C) who was staying at the rave while I looked for water. I thought I could text her at some point, but I was afraid she wasn't awake at that time. 

T-1:30: I am walking around with my friends and I wasn't really having a good time, so I thought it would be better to text my gf at this point. Fortunately, she was still awake. As I was walking around with my friends, I wanted to call her once I was alone in a chill place. The rave was next to some fields, so I could call her there. Going back to the place, I told M the story of how I met my gf, and how my relationship was going on at the moment, and she told me I was really fortunate to have such a relationship with someone. This felt like a charm at the moment, and I started thinking about my relationship and how comfortable I was with it.

T-2:00: I got to this place, and told my friends I was going to call my gf. When I called her, she was really sad, and crying. I stayed with her on the phone around 45 minutes until I felt she was better. I was really soft, I couldn't stop telling her how much I love her and how happy, confident, and inspired she makes me feel. I was almost crying at this point, as I realized she was the most precious thing I have in my life (obviously this is not the first time I thought it, but you know how rolling is). 

T-2:45: So I ended the call with my gf, and a friend of mine came to take me to the rave. I told him how the call made me feel so liberated, as I was able to tell her things I would not have told her sober because I was repressing it. All of us were peaking at this time, so we thought we could smoke a joint and go dancing. I don't really like dancing but I was really enjoying being around of people (with my mask on, stay safe folks). 

T-3:00: I was really thirsty, so I told M and other friend called Y to go for some water. We didn't really knew each other, but we were so high we didn't care at all. Y told me he was in a job pool (as he was unenployed for a long time) and I felt really happy for him! We went back to the soundsystem after this.

T-3:30: C wanted to go on a walk, so we went to drink some water and walking around for a while. I felt really connected to my friends at this point, and I could not stop hugging them and telling how much I loved them. We were tired, so we went to the fields to smoke some joints and chill with some music on. 

T-4:30: Although I was still rolling at this point, I did not feel the stimulant effects as much as the entactogenics, so I started to tell everyone in the place how much I loved them and how little I say that. My friend M was walking around a ditch, telling she loved the feeling of the cold wind of the night in her legs. 

T-5:00: As the sun was coming up, we realized it was time to go home. The rave was still up, so we looked for Y, but he wanted to stay a bit more. We walked around 7km listening to classical music and jazz, which I really like. 

T-6:30: We got to M's place. We rolled a joint and started to listen to some music, until everyone fell asleep. Although i wasn't really rolling at this time, I loved the feeling of my friend D next to me. When I realized everyone was asleep, I packed my things and went home.

Conclusions: This night was nuts. I really liked the feeling of the drug, and how connected to everyone I was.

 I also realized how fortunate I am with my girlfriend, and how much I have to look after her, she's a really incredible person. 

I also thought about how much weed I was smoking at the time (like 3-4 joints a day with friends), and realized I didn't really need it on a daily basis. Furthermore, I remembered how nice it was to be at home, just chatting with friends and doing my stuff, because since lockdown ended here (around a month ago) I was going out nearly everyday.

I realized how much I needed a job.

I've been taking mexazolam which has a half life of 16h, but tbh after 6h I don't feel anymore effects, just like xanax. 


Say I take 1mg at night to sleep, the next day after 15h if I drink am I at risk of amplifying the booze too much because there's still supposely the effect of 0.5mg? which tbh is kinda odd because I don't feel it at all after those long hours (I think?) and 0.5mg is noticeable on my anxiety 1h after taking, personally.

&amp;#x200B;

Pre-Trip Headspace:

I had near-debilitating stomach pain, constant diarrhea that made me shit my pants on the daily, and overwhelming nausea (in part from chemo, but this was out of the ordinary). There were a few days where I'd rush to the bathroom to relieve myself, but end up in the fetal position on the floor in overwhelming pain while dry heaving and shitting myself for at least 15 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Acquiring the Drug:

Enter metronidazole. I sent in a stool sample and tested positive for C. diff, so I was given this blessed antibiotic to treat it.

&amp;#x200B;

Trip report:

Day 1: No impact on my symptoms.

Day 2: Noticeable, but incomplete relief. No longer puking, diarrhea and pain are still a problem.

Day 5: Almost complete relief, symptoms are no longer a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts:

The relief I felt from C. diff was absolutely euphoric; I'd put it on par with a nice alcohol buzz. I don't think you'd get euphoria from it if you aren't sick, but maybe you would. I'm not a doctor!

I had to take it for weeks, but I never developed a dependence on it; stopping was a very smooth process. I don't think the risk of addiction is particularly high.

My doc prescribed me baclofen 10mg 3x daily for severe TMJ (that I think is being worsened by the taper), and a bit of research has suggested to me that it is also a gaba drug similar to phenibut.. and also addictive. This really worries me.

  


I asked both my doc and pharmacist if this would fuck up my xanax taper and both said no... I'm not 100% convinced of that. I've tried it twice and it has really calmed me down and helped the TMJ both times. Anyone have experience with this drug? How often can I take it without developing a dependence? Anyone use this to help ease bad days during benzo tapers?

I have been smoking weed alot over the past year. At one point during the summer holidays i was smoking 24/7 for days at a time. Now, im trying to stop. I had used it to cope with a super harsh breakup and the death of a close friend, but now im quitting.

Quitting isnt the problem for me, the damage is the problem. My memory is fucked. I used to have the memory of an elephant and now i struggle to believe what i did yesterday, because i dont remember well enough. My question is, will my memory ever heal?

We had a good time and was drinking beer. 
Sometime around 1 am the Swedish police showed up and said that the air smelled sweet. I immediately got kind of scared because I knew how marijuana smelled like because I had smoked it once 2 years prior, and yes I was a kid and didn’t know better. 

They said that everyone needed to take a drug test but I could not pee so I had to go to the station and do a blood test. 
I have not got the result yet and I’m still waiting nervously. I don’t really remember the night but I NOW KNOW, thanks to one of my friends at the party, that there was a cake that had marijuana in it but I don’t remember eating any of it. I also smoked some cigarettes but they seemed normal to me. 

Anyway, as a cause of this I haven’t been out driving because I’m scared i’ll lose my licence if I get stopped.

I can not find any answers on the internet about this but I believe that someone here has to know. 

How long can marijuana that you have eaten be seen on a drug test or how long does it stay in the system if you have not been in contact with marijuana in 2 years?

Would love to get some answers because I hate that this happened. As I said I willingly smoked marijuana once 2 years ago and got caught. The stress that came from that was hard hitting and I was scared that I would not be able to take my drivers licence. 
I told the truth but the test showed up as negative so they didn’t have any evidence for it.

Now I’m in this situation again that I swore I would never be in ever again. And the worst part is that I don’t remember eating of the cake that was there or that the cigarettes looked home rolled. 
Even though I might not have gotten the stuff in me I want to know if there is a difference in how long it stays in your system if you have been eating it or smoking it.

I will come back with an update when I get the test back.

I could get like 2 tabs for 30$. I kinda want to try oxy but opiod addiction runs in my family so im not so sure about that.

They nurse kept asking if it still hurt and I would lie so she would keep injecting me. It was like the best feeling ever I felt so at peace and didn't have to worry about anything and just felt like i was in heaven.

I honestly think im just addicted to not being sober. Like I dont think im addicted to weed itself but I just love being under the influence of something.

I’ve done molly around 5 times in my life, and I’ve never gotten the infamous “molly hangover.” The comedown is always really comfortable to me; there’s a number of things involved in this. Number one, I drink all the water I can. Staying hydrated is extremely important. There was a point last night, after taking the third point, that I became profusely sweaty although my body didn’t feel overheated. Secondly, I try to wait at least a month between doses and if I can, half a year to a year is even better. This way I avoid any health problems associated with repeated abuse. Thirdly, when I begin to come down on molly, I have a beer or two and a bowl and I fall asleep. Many people can’t believe this, and I’m not saying it’s always very deep sleep, but something about the molly high is very sedative to me. So even if I can’t fall asleep for a while, laying in bed while trying to do so is very comfortable and satisfying. 

If you guys have any questions about what else I did, feel free to ask! I mostly wanted to make this post to give an example of how harm reduction practices make for not only much safer, but also much more pleasant and enjoyable drug experiences.

We have cyphed and we always have good talks and adventures walking around smacked at night. However, this trip ended up being really awkward and just bad because of an unfortunate circumstance. Me and him are going to another smoke spot after hitting like 3, and this is our last one before we dip to our apartments. All of a sudden, this crackhead homeless dude coughs in front of us, like 5 feet away and we are not wearing our masks just because we were smoking. We quickly pull up our shirts to our noses, and he then goes up to the side of my face and says something about 4 dollars, he was right by a fruit stand so he might’ve been on meth and pretending to sell fruit or some shit. 

Once we pass the street we immediately wear our masks and then my buddy asks me if I have hand sanitizer. I am totally fucked because I forgot to bring my handy bag with me, which has hand sanitizer, wipes, and gum. I tell him if he wants to go to 7/11 since he wanted to drink something anyways and I’ll get the sanitizer. We do that and sanitize our hands and faces, then he tells me “Hey bro, I think we should call it a night.” I am pretty bummed because deep down I knew the guy coughing really fucked the vibe up but I agree with him and we both walk towards our apartments. We have a weird fist bump/dap and when I go home I text him asking if he’s alright and he says “Yah, wats up?” I told him “just checking if you got home and ur parents didn’t tell you anything.” He hasn’t responded since and I can tell he might be a bit pissed because his mom is a nurse and he travels a lot from my city to his hometown. 

I got tested next morning and I told the doctor my whole situation then he tells me. “Hey, I know at your age you do lots of wild things, just know that overthinking this won’t help you out.” “I can tell you are stressed out about this, but if it makes you feel better, the humidity of the outdoors makes contamination harder, aside from the fact you only encountered this guy for a few seconds.” He gave me a little nudge and told me “Enjoy yourself and stay safe.” I guess I’m just gonna sit and wait until my results come out. It’s gonna suck it I actually do test positive and I have to tell my buddy but at the same time, it might air things up if I test negative.

I was thinking about having a couple of drinks tomorrow (will be having sex and fun time). What are the risks of being on this medication and drinking alcohol?
 The effects of it seem to last like around 5h, and seems to be a bit less potent than xanax (0.5mg being maybe like 0.25mg of xanax)

I heard a lot of bad things about people mixing xanax with beer/liquor.


Question 1 - I take 0.5mg of mexazolam before drinking and fooling around because I'm feeling particularly anxious that day, would it be ok to drink like 2 beers or would I get way too drunk for too long or blackout? 
 

Question 2- say I drink 2 beers, would I be OK to take the mexazolam like 3h after drinking or is it still risky since there is still alcohol in the system?


Question 3- It's effects are like 4-5h max afaik, but it says it has a half life of 16h, does it mean I can't really drink alcohol for the next 16h after taking it? Like can't take it the night before drinking (to help me sleep)? 

I think the 2 beers will make me feel chill and I won't need the mexazolam that morning, but I am in doubt of how many hours after that it is safe to take the mexazolam again in case I get anxious after the effects of alcohol.

Weed: almost perfect. Weed is great for everything everyday and this is no exception. Not much to say here.

LSD: has the potential to be amazing but also has the potential to be terrifying. Know your set and setting and be comfortable with wherever you are. And be safe.

We would like to plan our sessions so that we feel good everyday with the least amount of harm to our brains and bodies. The main illegal substances that we have access to are: MDMA, ketamine, speed, LSD and shrooms. Unfortunately no 2c-b, and we don't like weed. Additionally, I personally haven't tried LSD nor speed, and I heard that a festival may not be the best place to do LSD for the first time (but correct me if I'm wrong). I think it's safest to roll only once and since the lineup on the last day is not the strongest, I would do it on day one or two. What would you suggest given this information?

Here's what my first idea was after browsing replies to similar questions of the sub:

Day 1 - speed orally (+ some alcohol maybe)

Day 2 - MDMA

Day 3 - shrooms (+ alcohol or ket maybe)

I am concerned whether taking speed on Day 1 would allow us to get any sleep and whether it would diminish the effects of the much beloved MDMA roll the next day. I also don't know if the shrooms can produce any euphoria having rolled the day before. Perhaps it would be better to switch the order up, or to replace Day 1 or Day 3 with the ket+coke combo (which I also haven't tried and I am not sure how safe it is) ? What do you think? Feel free to suggest different schedules too.

I know there are quite a few similar questions in this sub, but they are all a bit different and I still would like to ask for your your opinion.

Mentally addicted? Sure, how can you net get addicted to a group of substances if:

1. They have a broad range of effects - from mental support while adding some energy, through life appreciation, loosing bad habits, lifting mood trips, up to ego-loss life changing experiences.
2. There is a -1 urge to abuse them. I never felt the need to abuse them. Not a single time.The stronger the trip, the more time off before I even start to think about the next one.Redosing and binging is useless and pointless, I just had to learn for myself, which happened quickly.
3. They are mostly harmless long term.

I am so happy I ""met "" psychs :)

I am sure some of you feel the same :)Sending great vibes to everyone!

She wants me to go over to her friends house while she's at work to set up our tent for a back yard sleep over. I apologized to her friend this morning cause I briefly called her to ask her why my girl isn't picking up the phone. (I was heated/blacked out and constantly arguing with my gf)

I realized I need to slow down on alcohol. There's just this need to constantly be fucked up on something. That's my personal ordeal. 

What can I do in regards to alcohol and treating my loved ones bad? Was is a bad idea to get fucked on *yay* this morning?

Additional:My life is spiraling down(in my opinion) but fuck a shrink, I've been addicted to a lot of stuff and had a lot of problems(self harm, many drug addictions,etc...) through the years and overcame most of them myself without paying someone.

I have social anxiety and mild depression. After hearing about the therapeutic benefits of shrooms I have decided to take the plunge.

Golden teacher is all the rage, is it as good as they say? How often can you take shrooms without negating all the positive benefits. I understand that liquid shrooms are really just 4-aco- met, but does it provide the same clarity and insightfulness that many shroom users experience during their trips and which would you say better?

So last night, someone came through for me with a couple of benzos, 1mg each. In order to assess the drug itself, as well as it's potential to be used as a ""landing"" gear after a stimulant binge.

ONSET:

Although resources like the Psychonaut Wiki inform a curious mind that the onset time is 20 to 40 mins, the pill, ingested with a little water on an empty stomach, followed by some food, has started working in about 10 mins. Shortly after finishing my scarce dinner, I decided to walk over to the nearby shop to get some snacks before it hits, and to my astonishment, the dissosiation and drowsiness have already started to show. That made me smile and giggle at the thought of what is about to come.

10-20 mins after getting home, I was already quite sedated. Walking in a straight line proved to be difficult with my body unexpectedly swinging to the side a little bit, much like when I am under the influence of a high amount of a strong liquor, that is to say 5-7 shots. All i could effectively do is lie on my bed, watch youtube videos and stuff my face on the crisps.

DURATION:

I was able to resist the sleepiness for about two or three hours no problem. Although my eyelids were heavy, and my thought process was slow, I still could easily focus on what i was watching. The series actually seemed even funnier, but that change was not as perceptible as when you've smoked a couple of j's. The feeling of ""fogginess"" in my mind was at its peak, but given what I was doing, it did not prevent me from forming thoughts and even replying to texts without losing the train of thought. However, I can totally see how absolutely fucked I would have been if, instead of taking the pill after getting home, I would have chosen to pop it on the train. Furthermore, attempting to complete tasks like composing emails, studying, or god forbid, cycling or driving, would be completely impossible, let alone in some cases dangerous or detrimental. On the plus side, when I turned off my phone and decided to nod off, for a while before falling asleep I could see various ""dream like"" images akin to the ones people that take MDMA in high doses may see before passing out after a night out.

AFTEREFFECTS

This morning, my alarm woke me up several times. However, waking up was not the main difficulty. The central issue was in my lack of desire to get up and start the day, and every time after turning the alarm off and closing my eyes, I would fall into a deep sleep. It took a cup of coffee, 75mg of modafinil and rougly 10mg of adderall to motivate me getting out of bed, having slept in total for about 10-11 hours. I still feel pretty dased, uncomfortably so even and am hoping that more coffee would be able to fix it somehow. Furthermore, if one is a stimulant user, the benzo ""haze"" the next mornign/day may potentiate the circle of abuse of both substances to counter each other's negative effects.

CONCLUSION

Daily use of this substance may and will lead to a state of permanent dissociation, cognitive difficulties and memory loops. The effects are intense, but not so intense as to prevent the user to give in to the urge of combining benzos with alcohol, weed or stimulants. The use of benzos as a sleeping aid with minimal aftereffects the next morning is unclear, perhaps the dosage of 0.25-0.5 is required.

share your stories of getting xan'd out and combining it with other drugs, esp stimulants! Has anybody ever had a xan after, say, a meth binge? Also, I'm interested in hearing about your blackout stories and why do you think you blacked out. Never had that happened to me, so I'm curious haha,

I would like to share with you my problem with drugs.

So I have been smoking weed almost daily roughly for a year now (20m). When I am alone or have nothing particular to do in the evening, I like to get stoned and just relax. I am starting to get scared that I wont be able to take a break from weed as I am entering my freshman year this september, and will not have that much time for getting high as in my last year of high school. I just cannot say NO to myself to do it over and over again.

My motivation to do as much sport as I used to when I was younger is gone, and I go out with friends because of drugs and not because of them. It is not that I would not know or feel what is right, but even being full of remorse all the time does not make me study or work on my projects.

He is pretty chill, we go to college together and we live right by each other. He usually bounces a lot from his hometown to our city but we usually have a free day every month to smoke.

We see lots of cool shit, talk about life, the usual indica induced small talk that has us both questioning... We were having a pretty lit night smoking at a bunch of different smoke spots.

We get ready to go to our last spot when all of a sudden some dude coughs with his head tilted down a bit 7 feet in front of us! Me and my buddy do the rudest shit ever and cover our noses and mouths quickly with our tshirts because we kept our masks in our back pockets so we could smoke. The guy might’ve gotten mad and said something about “4 dollars” or something. He was definitely a homeless person/crackhead out in the city. He was by a fruit booth so I am not sure if he was trying to sell us fruit or if he was just crazy.

My friend looks at me and says “Hey, bro, you got your hand sanitizer on you?” I am fucked because I forgot my bag which I always carry hand sanitizer and gum in handy. I am like “bruh I completely forgot it, can we go and buy hand sanitizer?” We head to the nearest 7/11 so he can cop a drink and I get some weird lotion hand sanitizer thing. We both don’t say a lot for awhile which could be us elevated out of our minds or because we just can’t comprehend how fucked we are. He is obviously uncomfortable and I said “What about the smoke spot?” He shrugs and says “Yeah bro I think I gotta get back home, it’s like pretty late.” My apartment is after his and he offers to walk me home but it’s really damn awkward. We are listening to an artist’s new album on my phone and I say, muffled by my mask “Are you nervous because of what happened back there?” He looks and says he doesn’t hear me. We do that 3 times and I just tell him “nevermind.” We say our goodbyes and I text him “hey bro, are you okay?” He says “yea whats up?” and I just said “making sure you’re good and you got no smoke from your parents for being out.” He hasn’t responded and I feel like we ended up on a fucking disastrous trip. His mom is a nurse and my dad is like 70. I am going out to get tested today and I’ll update this if it gets enough traction if I actually got COVID. My buddy might tell me to fuck off if he finds out we got covid from that encounter. I also work so I would definitely have to quit for 2 weeks so I can recover if I do have it.

My first time and every other time after that (about 5 trips) was with my ex-boyfriend. About 3 days ago we broke up, stayed friends; it wasn’t really mutual though.

I am currently very sad and looking for a way to shift my mindset. I know LSD doesn’t necessarily change your perspective but I want an escape from my current life. 

I was thinking of doing 5 trips back to back. My ex would probably help me figure out the dosage for 5 trips that’s appropriate for me but I don’t want to really tell him it’s going to be trips with no real break. 

Basically I’d take LSD and once it worn off I’d sleep and after I’d take it again. 

Would this be safe? It probably wouldn’t take high dosages to get me high.

He had adhd and he handed me a couple of adhd meds. They were somewhat stronger than the average adhd meds. I took 2 (my friend took fucking 10)

We were both tired asf and it was like 01.30 so i headed home 30 mins after i took the pills. I walk straight into my room and go to sleep.
Suddently i felt my heart rate pumping fast asf. And then, well.. i got horny asf.

Now i want to mention that people react differently on masturbating with amphetamines. Some people love to have an orgasm on it, and others just cant get an orgasm. Let me tell you how it went.

So i turned on my pc to masturbate. And after the first 20 minutes i got really tired. But you guys know me? Im not a quitter. 
So i countinued wanking and i shit you not i did this for FIVE FUCKING HOURS STRAIGHT and the amount of SWEAT that was dripping from my face while doing it was unbelievable. 

And let me just tell you that my right arm was fucked up for days, i litterally thought it was permanently demaged and that i had to go to the doctor to tell the “whole story”

And also, some people experience side effects with adhd medication like licking their lips or clinching my teeth. I licked my lips so often so hard that i got blisters in my mouth. And it hurt like a motherfucker for days.

Not to mention that my orgasm was acting funny. When i finally came after 5 hours, i first came, and THEN AFTER the cum i felt the orgasm. (Cant say that the orgasm was pleasurable)

So what would i rate this adhd meds experience?

1. Masturbated 5 hours straight. Only to experience a none pleasure weird asf orgasm

2. I sweated more the when the fat bitch has gym

3. My mouth hurt and was full of blisters 

4. My arm got fucked up for days

5. Didnt get any sleep that day (obviously) and the lack of appetite didnt make me eat so i felt wack all day.

Sometimes teens who are down and sad do drugs to act like everyone else, “happy” but that’s just a illusion, not a lot of people are truly happy, so teens (like myself, who is 16 and many others) start doing drugs to fill a void in there soul and thus, these drugs make the person happy for a short amount of time, until eventually it takes over and if they don’t have that drug they feel even more sad than before. Then, there’s the other second part which doesn’t make a lot of sense, “they do drugs to fit in and fit in? What do you mean?” Someone might ask. Well a teenager will also do drugs to fit in if they feel pressured and scared that if they don’t do the drug that everyone else is doing they won’t fit in and they’ll lose there friendships with those people, even though there not really your friends, they’re just asshole druggies. That’s not to say every teen does drugs, it’s just my perspective and my experiences with teens who do, do drugs (haha, dodo) sorry my five year old senses kicked in. So to conclude this very short paragraph, I think that there’s only two reasons teens start doing drugs, to fit in or to fit in.


This is also not to say drugs can’t be beneficial, weed, lsd, shrooms, and other such drugs have been shown to be beneficial to many different types of people, all I’m saying is that there’s really no need for a teenager to start smoking weed until your of legal age to do so.

But now I notice, additionally to the withdrawal symptoms, I feel slightly stoned. It's like a constant pressure against my cheeks. Like how your head feels physicaly when you smoke weed. 
The last time I used drugs was 3 days ago. 2,5g shrooms with 20 Nitrous cartridges. This feeling was also present on other days in the last weeks, but I thought, that it might be weed aftereffects, but now it has been to long that that seems plausible.
Can I still experience effects of these drugs or is it the antidepressants. Is it maybe that I sleep to little? I have trouble sleeping now without trazadone. I'm writing this as I wake up so maybe it's that

About 6 years ago is when I started thinking that he was doing it. Today, I know he's been doing it. 

We would frequently get into arguments about his drug use getting in my way. Such as him stealing my entire sound system of my car and trying to play it off like I sold it to him. I used to have trouble with benzos and he would knowingly abuse the blackouts and tell me bullshit like this. I know for a fact, because I didn't black out this one night. When I went to bed, I expected to wake up and go install my sound system. In the morning, he tries to play it off and he kept saying random stuff. He tried to say, ""I owed my friend money."" Which clearly means, he sold my things to get meth. I broke down the house and got a restraining order from that (Well deserved restraining order IMO; BUT he should have got one too). 

I would call him out frequently for being a meth addict and he would always have these insane responses like, ""You are too"", ""I want you to be high like me"". Stupid addict things. I have been bumming cigarettes off of him for a long time now. I thought those nights I was hallucinating shadow people, super paranoid, were a part of my mental health. But I put a bunch of these incidents together and have realized that my dad has been lacing me. A few times I have received weed from him and there would be crystal shards inside the bud (Between stem and branch). I thought for a while, this is an accident he would never do that. BUT, word for word what he has said to me, ""I WANT YOU TO BE HIGH LIKE ME,"" was making me very afraid that he was doing it on purpose. I talked to some family members and they said it's probably an accident and I believed that too for a while. But TODAY, after calling him out for constantly smoking meth in the house with the windows closed, AFTER his mom JUST went to the EMERGENCY ROOM FOR HEART PROBLEMS, BLOOD PRESSURE, AND NOT EATING.... He offered me weed so I accepted it. He looked shady and his intentions didn't look friendly so I scoped out the weed. 

Sure enough, I break it open and a bunch of crystal shards shining that I clearly saw. Many pieces fell out, but I still have a big enough piece to test and see what it is. The nights of paranoia, hallucinations, my mental stability, my appetite suppression, just ALL of the fucking side effects meth does to you I have been having problems with for about a decade now. My health is rapidly declining, I have a meth smoker's cough and I have NEVER smoked meth. I have times where I can not eat or sleep after using the bathroom after he smokes in it. I thought this whole time it was just me losing my sanity without any purpose or reasoning behind it but it's sad to say the worst thing possible is the truth. I can't believe it but it is what it is. I am glad to be taking the appropriate steps for myself to get the fuck out of here but feel very bad for his parents. I have a strong feeling my dad and his girlfriend are trying to kill my grandma (his mom) to try and collect money or whatever he can from her. They are both very shady, they are known in the jail systems and belong there to be honest. I could be ok living with murderers, violent people if the cause of the situation makes sense to me. But for someone to be drugging their own child? To make their lives rot with theirs? WHO the F*CK does that?? I can't believe this. At least I know the truth now.

(throwaway account)

&amp;#x200B;

Almost every night whenever I get a script for Concerta (36mg) I'll abuse it, start from 10pm to 12am and getting high on it by mostly cutting it in half and taking it to make it IR, then keep taking smaller pieces throughout the night, until the sun rises and I start coming down. I'm not physically addicted to them or to that point like I am to Xanax for example but even if I know there will be side effects (worse ones are the uncomfortable physical sensations I get mostly in the comedown and the negative thoughts) 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also afraid of having any kind of health complication like heart attack, stroke etc. yet I can't stop when I have them, I only stop when the sun starts rising, just to start again with a low dosage whenever I go out and binge at night.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll usually take it with some kind of downer to take the edge off. Always Xanax, Alcohol, Pregabalin or all of them combined and then take more in the comedown. If I'm out of Xanax or lots of hard liquor, I literally feel like I'm dying, all the negative side effects stay and high fades (mostly physical) and to make it worse I am unable to sleep and all the depressed thoughts come to my mind, thoughts that I mostly cover and forget with drugs (except stims) throughout the day and night. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck it it's 5:46am right now my last glass of wine is almost over, I can take 1mg Xanax from my uncle if shit gets worse which it does, or take more pregabalin that I already have taken 900mg (although got crazy tolerance to it to the point I need more 1g to feel it anymore)

&amp;#x200B;

I just needed somewhere to vent, I always find this subreddit so useful and it's the only place where people won't judge me for what I am and for my drug use.

1st: LSD

2nd: Weed

3rd: MDMA

4th: Alcohol

5th: Nicotine

&amp;#x200B;

**Acid** is at the top of the list because it's just so crazy. The visuals, although not so beautiful in my opinion, are very interesting and cool. The time dilation is just so fucking trippy and LSD just lets me experience things so unusual and different from every day life.

There are a few things that pull LSD down, like the fact that there's a fair bit of anxiety that comes along with the experience. I get pretty huge pupils on it, and I can get really paranoid and uncomfortable around strangers, not because of a lack of sociability, but rather a fear they'll notice I'm high and then call the police or some shit. I also lose a lot of my communicative abilities, something I really value as well as being something I employ everyday. I like discussing complex subjects, and although I might have tons of ideas and opinions on LSD, maybe more than usual, I am woefully lacking in capability to communicate those ideas in that state. I also don't like the body high that much on LSD, especially as I come down, because then I can notice it more. It feels like I'm sweating on the inside of my body, and that all the cavities inside my body are filled with vapor. My voice changes as well.

**Weed** comes in at a close second. It's just so fun and nice. Everything is better on weed: music, comedy, food, socializing, nature, intellectual stimulation, my bed, cuddling, etc. I've also had a psychedelic experience on some sour diesel and that shit is one of my best memories with any drug. One thing that pulls down weed is a personal fear, perhaps irrational, that it makes me dumber. Not just in the period that I smoke, which is simply a fact and a downside, but that it makes my intelligence go down permanently. There is a great lack of research of weed. Although we know a lot about it, there's a lot left to learn, both on the subjects of effects and functions. We don't even know fully what the cannabinoid system's purpose is.

**MDMA** is kinda boring to me. I haven't taken it that many times, but from what I've experienced, I'm not the kind of guy that would go out and party on MDMA. I would definitely go out and party on weed, but I'd rather stay home and chill on MDMA. I wouldn't want to chill alone though, as I definitely am sociable on it. I'm just lacking in energy and vigor. It kinda sucks because that's the opposite of who I am sober. MDMA for me is only fun at such high doses where I'm so high I can sense the happiness as a physical sensation lol.

At low doses, taking MDMA comes with the anxiety of being caught, because of my huge ass pupils. At high doses, taking MDMA comes with the anxiety of getting addicted. Once, I was riding high, and had been for a while, before someone asked: ""do you feel like you're coming down right about now?"" The second they asked, I dropped like three notches. The extreme contrast made me feel VERY bummed out. That feeling was immediately followed by an anxiety that I had become addicted, because I had never felt such a bereavement. Luckily, I forgot about it a little while later, got a bit more high again, and then slowly descended into sobriety again. Something that pulls down MDMA on the list is the fact that it gives me intolerable insomnia. Sometimes it also makes me clench my jaw way to much.

**Alcohol** is super fun. It feels like MDMA at low to moderate doses for me. I get super sociable, super happy and just loving. I know a lot of people get violent on alcohol, and I also used to get that too, when I was younger (ninth to tenth grade). I guess I had more underlying aggression back then. At high doses of alcohol though, I get pretty sick. If I just transitioned from a moderate dose to a high dose, I will feel this sickness pretty hard, and it will suck. But if I went balls deep and got completely wasted, I will be too drunk to even feel that I'm sick, at which point I'll be a zombie that occasionally pukes here and there. People say I look like I'm on heroin when I'm that drunk. What pulls alcohol down is really just all the puking, mainly the puking that happens the next day. And if I'm not puking the next day, I'll be feeling hella queasy. I don't get head aches though.

**Nicotine** can be a lot of fun, and it can also suck. How much I like nicotine really comes down to how I take it. If I vape it, it's the best, because it hits me like a brick and feels as strong as weed, only for a much shorter amount of time. If I smoke it, I can get pretty buzzy and the whole process of smoking a cigarette is quite fun, with the smoke and smoldering tip. Oftentimes the feeling of the smoke being pulled down my throat and into my lungs is kinda nice too, but that depends on how much I've been smoking around that time. As of late, smoking hasn't been that nice and kinda disgusting, so I've actually quit it. Haven't had a smoke in quite a while. In my country, you can buy *snus*, which are basically packets of tobacco that you put under your lip. That shit is the worst. Because I cannot moderate how much nicotine I ingest as easily, I always end up getting hella nauseous and sick. Once I spent an entire bus ride cold sweating, trying to avoid puking, just from one *snus*, a fairly strong one at that. Mixing nicotine and alcohol is pretty fun, as it kinda knocks me the fuck out lol. I can be pretty breezy and then I'll have a smoke and I'll feel like I'm wasted. Mixing nicotine and LSD is also very fun. It makes me feel like I'm melting away. In addition to that, the whole experience of observing the cigarette get smaller and smaller as I smoke is very trippy. It kind of represents linear time, which is kind of alien to me on LSD.

Something that pulls nicotine down for me is the knowledge that it is destroying my health. Not only is the thought of increasing the risk of cancer not fun, but worsening my physical condition is also a bummer. I care a great deal about my ability to communicate, my intelligence and my physical condition, and I feel that all of those aspects are threatened when I take LSD, weed and nicotine respectively.

I have also tried 2-CB, nutmeg, caffeine and space jam, but I didn't notice any effects from those substances, so I couldn't really place them on the list. I did notice a slight increase in sociability from 2-CB though, but the effects were so minor I can't really say I have experienced 2-CB for what it really is.

So I have been taking Mirtazapine (Remeron) since \~November of 2019 for depression related to Borderline Personality Disorder. I have been on roughly 15-30mg per day. I juggle the doses based on my food intake. If I'm eating too much, I increase to 30mg, if I eat too much, I decrease to 15mg. Doing this causes absolutely no issues and I experience no withdrawal symptoms, but keeps my appetite right. 

Sometimes I would just drop to 15mg, again, with no problems. However, on either Monday or Tuesday of this week (more confident about the date being Monday) I completely ran out. I was on 15mg for around a week and a half after doing a fast taper down from 30mg. I was fine for the first 24-36 hours. I had no withdrawal symptoms. However, during the latter part of the evening on Wednesday, I started to finally feel what I could only assume to be withdrawal symptoms. 

The first symptom I had was paresthesia. It was a mild-moderate burning and tingling pain that started in my intestinal area. This eventually translated into me having tingling and occasional burning sensations all over my body. I used kratom and phenibut to help with the psychological effects of the withdrawal and they were fairly effective. My anxiety, however, wasn't quelled so easily. The pain became so great that they only way I was able to dampen it was to take a shower. I was not able to get any until Friday -- when I had my prescription refilled. 

Those two days, however, are still lingering after my withdrawal is over. I am having some minor dissociation that I associate with traumatic events. It's the minor dissociation I get when I feel like the event is happening again or, in this case, that I'm exhibiting symptoms of the withdrawal even when I'm not. For whatever reason, that withdrawal was the only withdrawal I have ever felt traumatized by and it was only for 2 1/2 days. I am very confused and disheartened that this happened and I still haven't figured out why it happened when I've had objectively worse withdrawals before. Is there a reason for this? Is it because it's antidepressant withdrawal?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,691309,public,confidence,self,Potential isolated PTSD from antidepressant withdrawal?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hkt0bp/potential_isolated_ptsd_from_antidepressant/,no_ads,0.0,1593846688.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is just a little observation I've recently had, nothing serious.

My wife and I have had a long and for the most part, a fairly good relationship with drugs. We still smoke cannabis regularly and bosh mushrooms every now-and-then, but haven't done anything 'major' for quite a while. I drink a bit and partake in relatively  low doses of the very occasional opiate (morphine, codeine, methadone, dipipanone) because I like to be functional and glowing, not nodding or gouging out.

We both had a quite serious relationship with amphetamines from about the same time, before we met. After we met our habits went into high-gear with us sometimes getting through an ounce of euro-paste in 4 days, or an eighth of Meth in a 24 hour period via IV, or staying up for 9 nights and seeing people walk through walls. However, once our first child came along, that was all knocked on the head, other than one rave when we had babysitters for the weekend.

That rave was 14 years ago and our oldest is 17, so that gives you an idea of the time scale.

Right, so...

We procured a small amount of Molly and Whizz thinking, ""Excellent, once the kids are out of the way we can relive old times"".

That is not how it went. The speed was good, really good, right up there with the gear we used to get but it wasn't like it used to be and we didn't even get to start the Molly. Our real-world responsibilities seemed to dull the fun and took the euphoria down to imperceptible levels.

That's when we realised that we're not the pill-boshing, speed-banging-up legends that we once were. It was a sad and joyous moment all rolled into one, a real end of an era but the beginning of another.

So, it looks like the moral of this story is never go back to old relationships as they won't be anywhere as good as you remember them.

Thank you for listening, stay safe and always test.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,691283,public,confidence,self,"Fuck, I'm old",0,[],0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hkqbws/fuck_im_old/,no_ads,0.0,1593836885.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All in the bin the morning it got emptied by the Garbo man.

I did it for myself as I was starting to rely on the weed and coming home after work to have that cone as soon as I could... It was affecting me (and the weed was doing almost nothing for me), and my other half knew it. She didn't like it, she's never done anything like that, she doesn't even drink alcohol (she's allergic) so she's never really known what it's like be drunk or have an altered level of consciousness.

I've always been very introverted and found that drugs helped me loosen up and take away a lot of my stress and anxiety. 

I got some MDMA the other day from a coworker as it has actually been almost 3 years since I rolled. I took 400mg tonight while playing video games on my PC, my old past time when I was younger and not as grown up with responsibilities.

Growing up sucks, I miss the days of going out with the guys, rolling, laughing, playing LoL on mephedrone with all of us in a house together.

Now it's all work, partners, bills, houses, kids...

Sometimes I feel the need to just dive right in take some of the tenseness away. I hope tonight was worth it, I'll find out in the morning. I've been so mentally drained and stressed this year as I've been working directly with the covid as an emergency responder. My partner doesn't really understand, she's been working from home since March....

At least that's when I started recognizing it and when it fucked me up because I noticed it. I always was socially phobic I'd and my social circle would say. With 15 it just got conscious for me what created the problem for me, the patient.

Right now I'm withdrawing from cigarettes (quit 5 days ago), Cymbalta-SSNRI (7 days ago) and phenibut (1 day ago) and I'm like fuuuck my personality and my life how I wanted it to be, my true self I enjoyed for the two months I was on phen &amp; cym is leaving me again and I just see it slipping away from me and I'm sitting here with painful physical withdrawals from it and can't do anything against transforming to the old me with my old life I hated so much. That including the physical withdrawal symptoms is very depressive and psychol./physic. hurting.

Just some short plus info: cymbalta alone never worked for me, phenibut alone was a good help but together it's making me how I want myself to be. Why I quit then? I only slept 0-3 hrs daily on it, didn't eat much and I couldn't ejaculate, but the hell without phen &amp; cym my sleep is shit too, I don't eat and I don't find any girls to fuck. Plus all the other shit that social anxiety and depressions brings with it.

I don't know how I ever could do it without drugs in life. I like phenibut, it alone is a good help but phenibut plus an antidepressant like serotonine (or noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitor makes me the person I want to be, the life I want to live. It makes me have a life I'm positive about. See a future I'm positive about. I do things I like, I produced so much music with so many people. I read so much and put so much effort in my favourite topic neuroscience as I study psychology. I connected to so many new people. If i wanted to do something I did it. If not, I was okay with it. I was confident and happy, I had a personality and people finally saw me, I finally saw me. Finally there was something, in the past, in the present, in the future and I liked every piece of it. I was able to use my brain, develop myself, my life, be intelligent, funny and creative and so much more. I finally worked and my head finally worked too. It was like switching from off to on. I just lived.

Now I'm sitting here again, no drug in my system expect for some weak ass kratom just go get a bit against the withdrawals and making me sleepy. I just played xbox for some mins and my batteries turned empty. I could go to the store 5 min walk and buy some. That wouldn't be a problem for normal persons or my phenibut me but now I get all that of my old me and life to see again. Oh damn I'm shaky, afraid of the people and noises if I'd go outside in a market now. Future anxiety hitting me, I recognize my brain, head, thoughts, my whole body is becoming cognitively very restricted again and I know I can be different but that's just the fucking natural me with it's social anxiety and depression that reduces me and my life to 5%. Right now it's starting to get to that old life again, with these negative and irrational thoughts coming up, myself not working at all and the anxiety of just getting out and buying 2 batteries, fuck. :(

I tried therapy, many meds, every SS(N)RI there is without any effect but side effects (as I said these meds added with phenibut make the magic for me). Tomorrow I'm starting a new type of antidepressants called moclobemide (it's an MAOI), let's see. Where's even the difference taking ss(n)ri, adderall, moclobemide or phenibut? Withdrawing from the meds I had from my doc were the same hell or mostly even much more terrific than getting off phenibut.

But in the end... I don't know how I ever could do it sober in life. That's just like hell on earth for me. I would rather take some medicaments for the rest of my life, maybe losing some years because of physiological issues but when I'm sober I don't live, I just can't and it's just a huge pain for me and throwing my life away.

What would be your suggestions? Anybody here who thinks the same like me and can't live sober? Anybody here who takes meds or drugs regularly to self-medicate this sober life problem. Sober I just suffer from depression and social anxiety and nothing works, might it be my cognition or my body. Sober it's not living, it's being in hell.

Im trynna figure out if they cant tell the difference from the amphetamines in MDMA or my shit was cut with meth, I only ever did M off the darknet and got from a very high rated seller and it was always the same vendor shit caused a lot of problems physically, and relationships wise id do and say things on it and wake up the next day and regret it, i drink quite often and get drunk and have never done or said anything like that ever... It wasn't very hard to quit besides I felt like so shit and empty and achy for over a month after. I completely villified mdma and condemmed it as a poison but was I maybe just taking meth? I mean I know mdma has methamphetamine in the name and its a amphetamine regardless. But damn  it seemed so safe and helpful at first but after a while i felt like shit whenever i came down and Id just want to take more to feel better but id just come up and right before I felt like i was gonna peak and it be awesome like it used to id just crash and feel like shit til i took more... And then instant repeat. Id always orally take the crystals right under my tongue never more than a .2, shit even fucked only the back of my teeth closest to under my tongue,the only part of the only teeth it touched messed them up bad but the rest of my mouth is perfect  and it was not like that b4 my molly habit😭 I never tested but the seller had such good ratings one of the top if not the top seller on dream. And ik u supposed to only take it once a month but I feel like under the influence of it, it convinced me that was bullshit and it was safe to do like acid and shrooms.

So I had a pretty awful experience last night, one in which I would instantly undo if I could, but alas I’m alive this morning so thank god for that. I do not know for sure, but I believe I induced some degree of serotonin toxicity given the symptoms I had. 

So I am not a typical drug user in that I only indulge in heavier drug use beyond weed and alcohol 2-3 times per year max. Reasons for this are because I have terrible impulse control and an incredibly addictive personality, but I find total sobriety very boring personally and after weed or alcohol only for this entire year, I thought I would indulge in a quite dangerous one but a drug I absolutely love: opioids. 

Had 22.5 mg of hydrocodone (three 7.5/325 pills) and roughly 45 minutes after ingestion I had a nice medium sized bowl of weed to kick it up a notch. I came outside to sit with my mom and realized immediately something was off. I used my watch to check my heart rate and discovered that it wasn’t too low like I had anticipated it to be after taking an opioid, but rather the opposite. My heart rate stayed consistently above 120bpm for nearly 4 hours after my initial check, and my normal resting heart rate is 53bpm. I immediately began to internally panic and so I excused myself from sitting with my mom and told her I was off to bed. I went to my room and lit my favorite candle and turned on a relaxing lava lamp to try and weather this storm I had now found myself in. I know that studies have indicated that peak opioid concentrations do not occur until roughly 1.3 hours after initial ingestion, and at the point of my shear panic of my condition it had only been just after I had the weed, so around 45 mins in, so I knew it was only going to get worse until after that 1.3 hour mark. I just had to get through there and I would be okay if I was not dead at that point. 

Well, I forgot to mention what else I had consumed only 2 hours or so before the hydro ingestion: a serving of EAAs containing tryptophan, which facilitates increased serotonin production. Once I realized that an interaction could be occurring between the opioids and the tryptophan, i came incredibly close to calling an ambulance for myself which in retrospect I probably should’ve done. I kept alternating between hot and cold, I had to fight to control my nods, my heart rate and probably blood pressure too were soaring, extreme hyperreflexia in my feet, extreme restlessness, nausea, extreme dizziness and lack of coordination while walking (discovered this after going upstairs to get some cookies and almonds thinking my blood sugar could’ve been low too), and ringing in my ears whenever I attempted to stay laid down, all symptoms persisted before reaching the 4 hour mark after ingestion of the hydro. 

Given all those horrible effects, I was obviously also experiencing an incredible amount of dysphoria and paranoia from my apparent potentially deadly physical state. No matter what I did, I could not distract myself and would always find myself refocusing on my physical condition, thinking and wondering “people make mistakes all the time and overdoses occur in those who had no intention of death so often, am I about to make that list?” I couldn’t bare to think how pissed off I would be at myself if I died last night. I’ve lost two friends to suicide and I’m not even of legal drinking age yet, and I damn sure do not want to make the list of kids from my high school who are no longer in the world after going off to college. 

So, I did what anyone would do when they’re concerned they might not be alive the following day and can’t decide whether or not to call an ambulance or not, I put on a nice 3 hour joe rogan podcast to possibly perish to. Funny enough, that worked as far as distracting myself from my physical state goes! In fact, by the 2 hour mark of the podcast, it had finally reached the 4 hour mark since hydro ingestion. Once I realized that at this point the effects had begun to subside, that I had finally also calmed down, that I was more certain now that I was going to stay alive, I decompressed all of that emotion and had a nice moment of vulnerability to myself. All I can say now after reaching a point where I could finally fall asleep and not be afraid of not waking up is “thank god”. Also I’m not religious either, but to whatever higher power there is and my unseen destiny in life is, thank you for keeping me alive. 

Don’t be like me please. I always have thought myself as a responsible drug user and I’ve never had a scare in my life, and certainly not one as incredibly harrowing as this one was. What’s funny is that after all the research I did last night trying to find any anecdotes or instances of interactions between the compounds I had yesterday, I never could find one that made me totally sure I was either fine or fucked. So, be careful please people. Feel free to roast me for this one too, I can take the criticism and learn from it now that I’m sober this morning lol. Needless to say i will never make a mistake like this again and as much as I love the way opioids/opiates feel, this may make me never touch them again. 

TLDR: fucked myself up on opioids, weed, and tryptophan. Avoid the combo of opioids and tryptophan as it may have induced a degree of serotonin toxicity in me. Thank god I’m still alive this morning.

I[27M]'m a bit confused right now and might need the opinion of experienced people in this subject if that's ok.

So I usually smoke weed about 3 times a week, I've tried truffles and LSD before, so I don't know if I'm a heavy drug user but I'm definitely open to it.

Three weeks ago, a friend suggested we take MDMA (from what he told me, it was pure, not laced with amphetamines), which I was very curious about, and I had a great time! I have been feeling pretty depressed for years and it felt good to have that feeling of happiness and general motivation for a few hours. I then felt a bit sad from the comedown, which I absolutely expected, so I didn't worry about that. (I think I took 50mg twice, with an hour in between.)

Thing is, since the comedown settled, I feel allaround just better in my life. My situation hasn't changed really, but I feel slightly happier, more open towards people, more motivated and confident about my future, and while I totally welcome these general good feelings, I can't help but associate it with the fact that I took MDMA and that maybe it kinda stayed with me?

What do you think about that? Is it common to feel good for a long time after the first time? Can you be ""stuck"" on MDMA? Is this why people talk about it as a possible ""cure"" for depression? When I look for long lasting effects on Google, I only find the negative ones, which is why I'm kinda confused about my current state.

It's a complex recipe but there's solid science behind it, essentially you take a low dose of nutmeg mixed with a bunch of terpenes and enzyme inhibitors from other spices, and it makes the trip a lot more pleasant and powerful than just nutmeg at a similar dose. The basic recipe should be followed but I find you can omit the nuts and the tarragon, and add ginger, cloves, almond extract, and allspice. Cloves are a good source of eugenol which potentates the nutmeg, ginger contains inhibitors which allow eugenol among other things to work better, almond terpenes act to potentate the other spices, and allspice contains inhibitors as well as elemincin if I remember right, all I know is that this formula works really well for me, I've tried it a few times and I havent had a bad time with it. I also wanna say that a lot of people dismiss nutmeg as a deleriant with little recreational value, which is somewhat true because nutmeg can act as a deleriant, but I've found that jts all about the dosing, always start with really low doses, as in 2 nutmeg nuts, or about 3 tablespoons of freshly ground nutmeg, and just ride through it, it can be relaxing and enjoyable if you let it sweep over you, just like lsd, its the people who fight the feeling that usually end up having the worst trips.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,691112,public,confidence,self,Talkin bout spacepaste (potentiated nutmeg trip),0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hkgln2/talkin_bout_spacepaste_potentiated_nutmeg_trip/,no_ads,0.0,1593800340.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would get high every day after school and as soon as the weekend rolled around we would get on to the harder stuff, coke, mandy , pills, ket, you name it I tried it. We had practically made it our mission to try as many drugs as we possibly could. As I was wandering through life in a dazy drug induced haze, the rest of my life was crumbling around me. 

Until, one day me and 2 friends of mine decided to drop a few tabs. We took around 150ug each. The trip started off really intense, we were in my friends bedroom while coming up. I had started to see the walls and ceilings ripple into a psychedelic sea of this rainbow haze. It was crazy, but it was really starting to stress me out. 

So we decided to go on a walk and obviously  us being the druggies we were decided to buy some weed. Things started to go downhill after smoking the weed. From then on me and my friends had entered a maze of confusion, we would constantly be repeating ourselves and  perpetuating eachothers crazy ideas. We were going a bit loopy, our trip sitter was confused as hell too, she had no clue how she could help. I am still glad she was there though as just her presence and knowing she was sober made me feel better.

Later on that night once things started to die down, I was laying in bed trying to get to sleep and all I could think about was my current situation. How I used drugs to mask what was really wrong, how I had been treating people so badly, especially the ones I loved. I really layed there and had a mental breakdown about how I had been  shitty person. It was one of the most painful experiences I’ve ever had. 

However, I woke up the next morning a changed person. I had a completely different mindset, I wanted to do better and be a better person. I started to treat people the way I would like to be treated. I saw a huge improvement in my grades, I started going to the gym and most importantly, I stopped doing drugs! I realised that there’s more to life than fleeting highs. 

The moral of the story really is that people often see psychedelics as something that just makes you see trippy shit but that’s not the case.

This  lsd story happened nearly 2 years back or so

i was at my friends house , with a few others where i took all the lsd tabs in my possession because no one wanted to do it , i had like 5-6 tabs of anything from 150ug to 220 ug tabs , it was a very split second thing where i didnt even think of it and i just shoved them in my mouth which was a extremely bad idea but i had drank abit and i was very like what the fuck why not type attitude

Within 10 minutes i was completely sober from the alcohol and my memory started to literally fail i was doing things and not realising how i got there and how i did them. , i then remember opening my eyes from a black out type trance where i had my eyes closed and i was seeing space where i didnt exist , it was like a very strong dmt trip where u close your eyes and your reality is no more and you can only remember doing and being the thing you are currently doing ( very hard to explain) but when i snapped out of that i was absolutely panicking because i knew i fucked up completely.

I kept having these weird sensations i had wet myself which i hadnt by the way, i then went to the toilet where I literally got lost in nothingness and i was just standing their with my dick out forgetting who i was and what i was doing , my friend had to snap me out of it and i kept hearing a childish type of music thing similar to the link below , the song lasted in the background for the entire trip , i didn’t question it in my head because i was so fucked up , nearly exact actually the same actually .https://youtu.be/GUQUD3IMbb4

The events are very muddled up and not in chronological order , but i next thing I remember is sitting on my friends couch shaking asking with a tremor to my voice “ when are we going outside, i was absolutely fucking shirting because within the first 40 mins of the trip the entire room was expanding and shrinking and changing colours and my friends voices kept morphing and going into reverse.

We finally went out after they had their pizza , i was walking through a field with them and we got to a park which was like a nature reserve and i kept forgetting how to walk and i would just stand their not moving zoning out trying to commute from my brain to my body to get it to move , it was like my brain signals were getting disrupted by a signal jammer , anyway after this happened for about 2 hrs i needed a wee again so i just stood their with my dick out in the middle of the night again at like 12 for like a literal 20 minutes doing nothing but getting stuck in a thought loop of unzipping my trousers and weeing , I convinced myself i was imaging this and i was actually still walking with my friends and multiple different scenarios were playing out and each one of them could of been real but i couldn’t tell which one was the real scenario.

I was walking with like 4 of my friends through a clearing and I thought it was becoming light outside because i say the sky turn purplely orange and it looked like it was dawn but it was only like 1am ish so i was completely hallucinating this while also hearing the song type creepy noises in my head , i heard them as if they were getting played in the background.

My friends started talking about Vietnam and shit because they were very big into politics and at this point they gave up communicating with me because i was just fucking out of it not knowing where i was or what i was doing , they actually asked me earlier in the evening if i even knew where i was as a joke and i didnt , i had no clue of what i was or who i was .

Anyway back to walk , they started to talk about Vietnam so when the wind would blow the bushes and leaves and grass would make a noise which i would interpret as Vietnam soliders hiding in the bushes and once again i felt like i was in a army partrol situation in the middle of a vietnam jungle , i was rolling around in the grass for like 15 minutes doing geeked out random things thinking i was fucking dodging bullets and i ended up realising the next day i lost a £10 note while rolling around in the grass .

I think my friends were fucking with me and they said something like “My name ,your the biggest one of the group make sure theirs no random hobos or whatnot in the forest area “ as we were exploring a dark wooded bit where ive been before when we were all drunk one night , so i grabbed a massive stick with adrenaline pumping through me expecting to be ambushed by Vietnam soliders , i was not scared i felt like i was going to die for my country and a good cause so i was very enthusiastic and ready for it .

The walk gets very hazy after that bit because I kept thinking i saw people hiding from me but i was so fucked up i couldnt really react to it or run away like i did before because i was having trouble walking for most of it .

I can briefly remember us sitting down on a bench or something but that was what i can remember from the walk which was a few hours.

Anyway we got back and i was starting to come down a little from the trip i was actually able to communicate without coming out in backward phrases and noises which didnt make any sense because i was trying to say something like lets say for example “ can we go over their soon “ i would say it as : “ we can over their go soon “  like most of what i said didnt make sense at all , anyway they kept trying to get me to read a book to see if i had a ego death or something and i couldn’t actually read it was actually impossible, non of the words made any sense and i didnt know what they even meant .

I kept shouting i think im having a ego death and shit like that and then i grabbed a beer because i was still completely out of it after 6 hrs because i took it around 7-8pm and by 3am i was still completely hyper as fuck and a total nutcase screaming random things ,

They were trying to go to sleep and i just started randomly talking to myself and having conversations with myself about random shit and they eventually said for me to go in the gazebo which i did and the weird thing is as i stood up i had a overwhelming sense i was adolf hitler about to do a speech to his country but time sort of stopped and slowed down completely and i was starting to do a mock voice of adolf hitler and nazi salutes and they eventually locked me in the gazebo because i was screaming to myself.

Because it was nearly pitch black because they eventually turned the tv off i was hallucinating so much more , i saw a guy appear in front of me having a conversation with me and their was this orb of sorts which i could peer into to go into a new reality and i was hallucinating being at a coffee shop talking to a nice guy , i then hallucinated selling drugs to people in a park and the couch i was sitting on turned into a bench and i kept seeing people come past and ask for drugs so i would quickly look around for police then discreetly raise my hand to give them a hand shake and pass them a bag of weed or something and i would say , “ its all their mate have a good one “ and stuff like that and eventually i came out of that and one of my friends came to check on me and to them i was just doing random arm movements and talking to nothingness and kept reaching into my pockets . I

actually came back to reality and the first thing i saw was my friend staring at me through the glass and watching me with disgust and he seemed scared actually, “he said are you alright “ and during this i was still having a very heated conversation with someone or myself i cant really remember but i just kept saying stuff like “ shut up thats not true and i was getting really angry because i would hear in my head someone violently oppose my opinion or whatever i said “ so i snapped out of that and i said yes im fine am just having a conversation with someone and to me that seemed completely logical and a fair normal thing to do .

He explained their was no one there and him saying that sort of snapped me out of it again, i was definitely starting to come down but by 5pm i was still seeing crazy visuals but my sanity had returned and the last visuals went away at around 8am and i got like 30 mins of sleep before i left his house and i was completely shaken by the entire experience because it honestly didnt feel like a normal acid trip , the high doses feel completely different as if i had a different drug all together.

I had a cigarette to carm me because i was scared and felt mentally exhausted and confused about what even happened during the night .

Also a thing i forgot to mention was when i went to the toilet and my friend went to get me he addressed me as adolf hitler and i was completely fucked so I immediately thought i was adolf hitler in a house on the eastern front with other nazis in a snowy eastern front environment holding out against soviets abit like the first zombies map on WAW the nacht der untoten map ,

They started to play tank sounds and stukker dive bomber sounds to scare me and i sort of knew after a few minutes they were just fucking with me but it completely changed the visuals because i saw a literal massive panzer tank crash through my friends living room wall then disappear.

But yer on high doses of like 700-1000ug reality gets extremely distorted and its hard to tell what’s actually real.

I tested the batch of acid anyway to make sure it wasnt dom or 25-i because 5/6 tabs of 25-i would kill me .",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,691098,public,confidence,self,"After people liked my other lsd story ive wrote out another more crazy experience i had, its extremely long by the way .",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hkfoto/after_people_liked_my_other_lsd_story_ive_wrote/,no_ads,0.0,1593795391.0,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'iq-3WWyoXnS_srDn4ZKgGpO7mM93KrvOjDzryfFAAI8', 'resolutions': [{'height': 81, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jTCYW2PKQByPuhR0onsAlWojo3r8cc1hII0FXEWJOGE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee61084155e625feaaa6cdcc7d2c4bea2bea6ecd', 'width': 108}, {'height': 162, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jTCYW2PKQByPuhR0onsAlWojo3r8cc1hII0FXEWJOGE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=875818dc2bf65ec1c99fb6fcd9453c64f967335a', 'width': 216}, {'height': 240, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jTCYW2PKQByPuhR0onsAlWojo3r8cc1hII0FXEWJOGE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51dc644f95cc70d4bae4eb1fa8e8554b5e396f90', 'width': 320}], 'source': {'height': 360, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/jTCYW2PKQByPuhR0onsAlWojo3r8cc1hII0FXEWJOGE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5f700f7a2764815611a9101a302e3090eaa2a326', 'width': 480}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think my friends were fucking with me and they said something like “My name ,your the biggest one of the group make sure theirs no random hobos or whatnot in the forest area “ as we were exploring a dark wooded bit where ive been before when we were all drunk one night , so i grabbed a massive stick with adrenaline pumping through me expecting to be ambushed by Vietnam soliders , i was not scared i felt like i was going to die for my country and a good cause so i was very enthusiastic and ready for it .

The walk gets very hazy after that bit because I kept thinking i saw people hiding from me but i was so fucked up i couldnt really react to it or run away like i did before because i was having trouble walking for most of it .

I can briefly remember us sitting down on a bench or something but that was what i can remember from the walk which was a few hours.

Anyway we got back and i was starting to come down a little from the trip i was actually able to communicate without coming out in backward phrases and noises which didnt make any sense because i was trying to say something like lets say for example “ can we go over their soon “ i would say it as : “ we can over their go soon “  like most of what i said didnt make sense at all , anyway they kept trying to get me to read a book to see if i had a ego death or something and i couldn’t actually read it was actually impossible, non of the words made any sense and i didnt know what they even meant .

I kept shouting i think im having a ego death and shit like that and then i grabbed a beer because i was still completely out of it after 6 hrs because i took it around 7-8pm and by 3am i was still completely hyper as fuck and a total nutcase screaming random things ,

They were trying to go to sleep and i just started randomly talking to myself and having conversations with myself about random shit and they eventually said for me to go in the gazebo which i did and the weird thing is as i stood up i had a overwhelming sense i was adolf hitler about to do a speech to his country but time sort of stopped and slowed down completely and i was starting to do a mock voice of adolf hitler and nazi salutes and they eventually locked me in the gazebo because i was screaming to myself.

Because it was nearly pitch black because they eventually turned the tv off i was hallucinating so much more , i saw a guy appear in front of me having a conversation with me and their was this orb of sorts which i could peer into to go into a new reality and i was hallucinating being at a coffee shop talking to a nice guy , i then hallucinated selling drugs to people in a park and the couch i was sitting on turned into a bench and i kept seeing people come past and ask for drugs so i would quickly look around for police then discreetly raise my hand to give them a hand shake and pass them a bag of weed or something and i would say , “ its all their mate have a good one “ and stuff like that and eventually i came out of that and one of my friends came to check on me and to them i was just doing random arm movements and talking to nothingness and kept reaching into my pockets . I

actually came back to reality and the first thing i saw was my friend staring at me through the glass and watching me with disgust and he seemed scared actually, “he said are you alright “ and during this i was still having a very heated conversation with someone or myself i cant really remember but i just kept saying stuff like “ shut up thats not true and i was getting really angry because i would hear in my head someone violently oppose my opinion or whatever i said “ so i snapped out of that and i said yes im fine am just having a conversation with someone and to me that seemed completely logical and a fair normal thing to do .

He explained their was no one there and him saying that sort of snapped me out of it again, i was definitely starting to come down but by 5pm i was still seeing crazy visuals but my sanity had returned and the last visuals went away at around 8am and i got like 30 mins of sleep before i left his house and i was completely shaken by the entire experience because it honestly didnt feel like a normal acid trip , the high doses feel completely different as if i had a different drug all together.

I had a cigarette to carm me because i was scared and felt mentally exhausted and confused about what even happened during the night .

Also a thing i forgot to mention was when i went to the toilet and my friend went to get me he addressed me as adolf hitler and i was completely fucked so I immediately thought i was adolf hitler in a house on the eastern front with other nazis in a snowy eastern front environment holding out against soviets abit like the first zombies map on WAW the nacht der untoten map ,

They started to play tank sounds and stukker dive bomber sounds to scare me and i sort of knew after a few minutes they were just fucking with me but it completely changed the visuals because i saw a literal massive panzer tank crash through my friends living room wall then disappear.

But yer on high doses of like 700-1000ug reality gets extremely distorted and its hard to tell what’s actually real.

Apologies in advance for any grammatical errors, the hydro is  kicking in. My best friend who I have posted about before on my other account had a maybe 2 or 3 hour conversation with me today about my use and our friendship. To give some perspective we are both going in to our 11th grade next year (I'm gonna be brutally honest because this is an alt account) and we have been friends since 6th grade but lost contact for 3 years in between grades 6 and 10 because I went to a private school. I have spent the past 2 years reconnecting with him and reforming our friendship into and extreme best friendship. We have everything in common, like all the same stuff, did drugs together, and never really argued or lied... until today. He got a gf back in maybe October or November of 2019 and was with her until February and during that entire time period we went from smoking weed and chilling together everyday to basically not talking anywhere else but in school. Because of this I had resentment towards him and for a while afterwards (about 2 months actually right before COVID) he did not want to smoke any weed with me or even really hang out. Once COVID happened we started talking a lot more again on Snapchat and playing Modern Warfare together constantly. (sorry if I'm rambling, I know I'm going to get some hate for this kind of post maybe even taken down but I just need someone who can relate to the pain I am feeling...)) 

^(So, we start talking about smoking weed together again once quarantine ends and how we're gonna have a dope summer doing hella drugs together and having a fucking hoot. So, I end up setting up a day where we can hangout and smoke and have a bonfire together, but my brother can't come thru with any weed so I end up copping a bottle of Ciroc from him and setting up a sesh with my friend for tomorrow where he can spend the night and get shitface drunk with me and we can have a sick bonfire (no weed because he is getting a job and needs to get drug tested for it). Anyways, I was talking to him today after paying my brother for the bottle about hanging tomorrow and what time he was coming over and somehow we got on the subject of how much we were drinking. I think I may have mentioned being hungover on the 4th of July and how that would suck? He then proceeded to tell me that he was gonna o easy and I started to bust his balls jokingly about how that would be lame (apparently big mistake or the first of many lol). Sorry I use so many parentheses, I'll stop LMAO. So then he starts to say how he prefers to be buzzed instead of full blown puke drunk and I mention how his ex must've neutered him since he's been such a puss since they got together. He of course got pretty defensive and this kinda sparked the whole argument, because I then said how we never hung out when they were together and he never wants to do anything risky or fun anymore (which isn't true, I'm just a mess and want to push my limits as far as possible).) 

^(This little jab match soon turned into a Discord call where he was defending himself and I was speaking my mind about his past relationship and how it changed him. It was civil at first, both of us understanding each other's points as it usually went between us, but this quickly turned south when it eventually turned into how I push him far past his comfort level with drugs because since he got in that stupid fuckin relationship (sorry the liquor andger is kicking in and I hate his ex lol) he has not ""matured"" even more apparently and confronted his problems that made hi  want to use weed and alcohol with me so regularly before. I told him he didn't need to act so grown yet and that now is the time to do drugs and be immature because pretty soon  we're gonna graduate and have to wake the fuck up. We then really got on the topic of my drugg use and I essentially admitted I was extremely mentally addicted to weed (which he pretty much already knew but didn't know my motives. I told him how ever since I was a kid I have always been in a constant state of anxiety and stress and was unable to control my anger and drugs has been the only thing that has truly alleviated that for me. I then confessed how I usually only use weed nowadays to feel less self-hatred and to just feel overall decent. I told him how I am not really happy when I'm sober, and usually have physical and mental discomfort while sober (this being due to my Asperger's, cholinergic urticaria, anger issues, depression, and anxiety. not trying to give excuses or get sympathy, just providing some reason for my behavior and habits). He then pretty much told me I was the textbook definition of an addict and that I am burying my problems with drugs (mostly weed and alcohol, but I have done hydros like right now and other shitty otc meds to get fucked up). I admitted he was right, but then it became how he can no longer do anything with me because it was enabling. Btw just to clarify he said he knew I wasn't physically addicted and I told him how I don't say I'm an addict because it diminishes addict's with real struggles like my heroin addicted brother and his father who is a heavy alcoholic and painkiller user.) 

^(Nevertheless, he said I am mentally addicted and by smoking weed or drinking with me he is enabling my bad habits and harming me. We then argued in circles about how when I use alone and with him it's different and how I am doing it for fun with him but doing it to feel mentally stable alone and that pretty much just dug the hole deeper. It ended with him teared up saying how we just can't do drugs together until I face my mental health problems and can balance my drug use and still be able to deal with my lack of self-confidence, unhappiness with my physical health (I'm fat lol) and just overall shit attitude we cannot use drugs together and we are taking kind of a break from talking for this weekend. So obviously I was pretty pissed the entire call, but after it ended it immediately felt like my heart was being squeezed hard. I have been having some confusion with my sexuality for quite some time (idk if I'm bi or just super horny lmfao) and just to clarify I FEEL ZERO ATTRACTION TO THIS MAN NOR DO I EVER WANT TO. But, it truly felt like someone broke up with me and just broke my heart because I knew I had to choose between my habit or my best friend. I cried a little while I was snapping him telling him how I was sorry I was being a dick and no matter what we will be friend regardless of this shit. He responded wholeheartedly agreeing with me, saying how sorry he was for ditching me for his ex before and how as long as we know each other we will never do that to each other and that we will stay friends through high school no matter what. I know I'kll get made fun of for this post but I don't give a fuck, I've never shared that whole shit about my sexual confusion like ever before and I'm just letting it all out not only because this is a throwaway but to demonstrate I pretty much lost one of the only things that even matters to me, my drug buddy. We had a whole plan of how we were gonna move out together and grow weed and press it into live rosin to dab and our apartment would be so sick and we would go to the same college together and go to parties. I guess my fantasy of having that best friend I go and do drugs with and party with (my childhood consisted of a lot of teen comedies and my favorite movie is Superbad so that's why I guess I've always had this must do drugs to be cool mentality). I have never had as good of a friend as this guy and I'd literally get my ass kicked by 3 buff black guys for this dude. I told him how he's a great friend no matter what, the best I've ever had and that I love him ""no homo of course"". Yes, I put that lol. And, he said the exact same thing right back pretty much word for word. I hope on everything in this god awful world that nothing changes between me and him and that hopefully our graduation rooming together plans stays the same but right now I'm basicallt just going to push myself as far as I possibly can to just drown out the pure loneliness I feel right now.

 different but they both are the only drugs I've had (haven't tried mescaline btw) that have that real  psychedelic feel if that makes sense.

I had a seizure and broke a bunch of bones had to have surgery all that stuff. In the hospital they had me on IV valium. Then they switched me to 10 mg oral valium, in the form of 2 5mg pills a day. I did that for 5 days and then they had me jump down to 5mg a day. I did that for 5 days and honestly felt fine. Then I was supposed to stop after 5 days of 5mg but after almost 30 hours I started getting a lot of anxiety, and since I am still getting over the seizure I called my doctor. It's hard for me to determine whether I'm in that place of withdrawal where I just feel uncomfortable or am at risk for a seizure

Anyway I called doctor and they got me on another 5 days of 2mg. I think I'm gonna do 3 days of 2mg then 4 days of 1mg. My question to you guys is, does that seem ok? Every doctor I've talked to seems to think so but every story online says way way otherwise. I took the 2mg for the first time today and don't feel anxiety now. Or really any withdrawal symptoms. It's hard to tell because I'm taking percocet Norcos and benadryl for my messed up arm and an allergic reaction to the bandage from surgery.

I'm having trouble sleeping but I think it's the nodding out from the perc's cause I fall asleep then jerk away suddenly and that happens when I take opiates. So I don't THINK I'm having symptoms from my jump from 5mg to 2mg so far.... Even tho I jerk awake I don't have anxiety right now. Do you guys think I'm handling this correctly?

So it first happened earlier this week on I believe Tuesday when my boyfriend and I drove to racetrac to get cereal. Weird I know. Target and Walmart close early because of corona and we knew racetrac had mini cups. So we drove to the nearest racetrac. We were also not in our home neighborhood but rather visiting my sister and helping her move in the city next to ours. It was no later than midnight. We got to the racetrac 5 mins away and we were going to park on the side of the gas station. Then I told my boyfriend to park in the front because I wanted to wait in the car and I didn’t want to sit in the not well lit area. I wanted to wait in front just in case to be safe where it was well lit. I’m weird about that. So we are driving to the front and this Tall Young black woman walks straight to our car and looks us dead in the eyes. Puts her hand on the hood of the car and signals us to “come on” with her two hands. Then she flips us off and walks back to her car. We felt super weird about that and soon see that her car was on the other side of the gas station... why did she come to us? We decide no more cereal and get back on the road and take the long way just in case. In that short time she got back into her car and was in front of us already because she got directly back on the Road from the gas station entrance. Shes in front of us, sees our car, gets into the next lane, and reverses and tries to look at us directly. My boyfriend gets into the lane over and gets onto the service road and she follows us. She got super close to us on both sides wouldn’t move. She was racing us and would brake to get closer to us. We hit the brakes at one point when she was going super fast to see if she would get away. She hit the brakes too when she was a couple hundred feet away and reversed back to us. She almost ran us into the ditch by the highway on the service road 3-4 times. We finally speed up and got onto the highway and she missed the entrance. 

Fast forward to tonight on Thursday in our home town, when I was dropping off my boyfriend at his house around 9ish. I stopped in front and we talked for a couple minutes before he had to go inside. We saw a car upfront driving towards us with headlights on and I assumed it was a cop. We were just sitting talking and I didn’t think anything of it because we weren’t doing anything wrong. The car slowly creeps next to us and we see it’s not a cop car. It stops at the stop sign behind us once it past us and makes a u turn and gets directly behind us. My boyfriend tells me to drive immediately. I start driving and I accidentally pushed my trunk opener and it flew open. I couldn’t see behind me but it eventually closed with the wind. Luckily my boyfriends brother lived not too far away, only a couple blocks and I booked it there. I ran two stop signs getting there because if I would of stopped, the car behind us was so close to us going so fast he would have ran into us. We get to his brothers house after not even 3 minutes and this older white male with long hair gets out of his car and immediately starts yelling to us saying we are human trafficking and putting people in danger by running the stop signs. My boyfriend tried to calm him down and the guy says he got my license plate and gets in his car and drives away. We called the police that time and filed a report. I was crying and couldn’t even think about calling the police in the moment because it was so fast and I couldn’t function really. 

We are so shaken up by this and think it’s so strange that it’s happened to both of us together this week.... what does this mean??? Is this a sign I shouldn’t be driving? Do I need to get my life together? Or is this just bad luck and timing? I’m sorry if this all doesn’t make sense I’m just still scared and can’t gather all my thoughts.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,691056,public,confidence,self,chased by 2 crackheads in the same week...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hkcpop/chased_by_2_crackheads_in_the_same_week/,no_ads,0.0,1593779683.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I mumbled, stuttered, and constantly tried repeating “Im drunk” as a way to explain it better. Then I realized that salvia only lasts like 10 mins so I somewhat got a grip on reality and chilled. I looked at the forest we were chillin by and I couldn’t tell what was a person and what were my friends, all the trees and leaves looked like a fucking stock image of people waving to me.

I was having a normal Wednesday, and decided I would bike over to my plugs house to get some tabs. I buy 4 100 microgram tabs, and start the 5 mile bike ride home. About a half a mile away from his house, I went into the parking lot of an abandonded gas station I sometimes chill and smoke at, and popped 200 micrograms. Of course, at this point I decide to walk the rest of the way to my house as biking would not be the best idea. So, I get home and read a little during the come up. Reading became far less interesting than the patterns on the floor, so I put the book down and decide to go for another walk. 
   So on this walk I go to the main street in my town, and I am walking down it because at the end of it theres this big park I was gonna chill at. As I was walking, I started hearing a noise, so I took the headphones out of my ear, and heard it was a protest marching in my direction. Of course, being the dumbass I am, I decide to join it. I joined it at the end of the protest, when the speeches were wrapping up and it had ended in the park I was initially trying to get to. And of course, out of the crowd of 200 people I happened to stand next to my orchestra teacher from High School, and she noticed I was there and said hi to me. Pretty awkward while my pupils are almost as big as my eyes themselves.

After 18 years, I decided to stop cold turkey because I was always told it was supposed to help me focus, and as a university student during exams, that was not happening. I started questioning its purpose, and how it could possibly be doing anything if I had been at the same dosage for as long as I could remember.

When I stopped 2 years ago, I went into a depression for atleast 7 months. That summer I went to work and would go straight to sleep when I got home just to start the cycle again the next day. I realized adderall had kept me awake all those years and I couldn’t do it on my own anymore. I also had never felt anxiety before going off it. Matter of fact, I didn’t feel a range of emotions while on adderall at all. I never had extremes. Never got mad, sad, super overjoyed.. I was always content and saw myself as a generally positive person. 

Looking back, my emotions were extremely suppressed. I was just in a state of ignorant bliss. I was on pure autopilot to a point where now I feel like I can’t even remember half of my childhood because I wasn’t truly present. It’s quite sad. And Awareness is something I have to work at really hard now!

Another thing was motivation. Because adderall is a stimulant, I believe it also was a natural motivator? I legit had to teach myself how to be interested and motivated to do my daily activities and hobbies.

Sometimes I wonder who I’d be now if I had gone off adderall sooner.

I want to hear your stories though. Because when I was considering going off, I remember trying to research the side effects and couldn’t find much at the time. Do you think adderall messed with your memory? Motivation? Ability to stay awake? Emotions? Etc?

TL;DR I was prescribed adderall at age 3, then after 18 years stopped cold turkey and it really messed me up.

I wanted to share my experience with taking vitamin D_3 supplements. Every morning along with my other medication I add one 400IU gel tablet and take it daily. Not only does this give me the vitamin D I need but it also helps with processing calcium for stronger bones! I get consistent vitamin D without relying on weather here in oregon or having to worry about going outside every day.

Vitamin D is extremely impactful and beneficial for your general wellbeing but most importantly mental health. This is usually the case for seasonal types of depression, and I’m not saying it’s a cure all to replace an ssri that works for you but it doesn’t hurt! Even though I’m going through shit with a felony charge and medical bills piling and needing to buy a car and pay rent and college bills, I have a general sense of well-being and my depression is substantially diminished. 

I urge you all to give it a go, spend the 10-15$ on a 200 count bottle of vitamin D3 supplement (needs to have the 3 as a subscript) and take one every morning when you wake up. See how it feels after a week or two and get back to me! Doesn’t hurt to try since it’s not like it is addicting or that it is bad for your body.

I can’t stress it enough, and I can attest to knowing it’s the vitamin D 3 because I would take it for a few weeks, feel better and say I don’t need it anymore and stop taking the vitamins, shortly after within a few days I’d fall into a depressive slump until I started vitamin D again. I’ve done this 4-5 times now cuz I don’t think so I know what it’s doing for me. 

Check it out guys seriously! It won’t hurt you and will absolutely make your drug use far more enjoyable. Things like ritalin and adderall and even benzos opiates and psychedelics all feel 10x better when I’m at a better space mentally

I recently found a [study](http://www.apjtb.org/article.asp?issn=2221-1691;year=2018;volume=8;issue=3;spage=187;epage=188;aulast=Md) that proposes that the consumption of thymoquinone may be helpful for managing amphetamine addiction.

It has been proven useful to help reduce tolerance and addiction [to tramadol](http://www.apjtb.org/article.asp?issn=2221-1691;year=2018;volume=8;issue=3;spage=187;epage=188;aulast=Md#ref15) and its ability to influence dopamine and other neurotransmitters suggests that it might be useful for managing amphetamine addiction.

Black seed oil is also allegedly a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and CYP2D6 inhibitor, so it can make a number of substances much more effective and drawn-out in duration. [Some users](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/2yrekz/i_feel_that_i_really_need_to_share_this_as_i_just/) have found this effect to be dangerously potent. Ironically the same user found that black seed oil helped to mitigate the same overwhelming symptoms that it caused.

Other [users](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/70kcqv/black_seed_oil_has_repaired_my_broken_gaba_system/) have found black seed oil immensely useful for helping to repair their damaged GABA system. 

Black seed oil is also an [HDAC inhibitor](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2008-05-traditional-herbal-medicine-pancreatic-cancer.html). This mechanism on its own is alleged to be responsible for a large part of ketamine's antidepressant effects. Black seed oil is also believed to have some small action at the mu opioid receptor site.

Just thought I'd drop this information here since black seed oil has been invaluable to me. All of these benefits don't even scratch the surface of its actual health benefits, either. It's an incredibly potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant that can boost immunity.

If you are considering buying BSO, I would recommend finding it at a foreign / Indian import store. It may be harder to find but will generally be much, much cheaper than the standard price (I pay $27 from the health food store), or you can find a store that stocks actual black cumin seeds (about $5-10 for a kilo) and grind those up in a coffee grinder and just eat those. 

I am currently using it to help level out my experience with dextroamphetamine which I'm currently using for study. I find it helps bring in extra clarity and eliminates some of the more physically demanding symptoms.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,691007,public,confidence,self,Harm Reduction - Amphetamines (and Opiates) w/ Black Seed Iuk,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hk8i08/harm_reduction_amphetamines_and_opiates_w_black/,no_ads,0.0,1593762945.0,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'P1kmUN-VoQVK05JfTKYHDCxKdu4LiWYBuzcLL_Lxi1k', 'resolutions': [{'height': 100, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FaqvrK2p85KmbJXx5loCQ9bCkeYLKmiuhUHx8JA-WIU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f080686ce89b74c2e5f6c16bc666f43acf760cd7', 'width': 108}], 'source': {'height': 112, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/FaqvrK2p85KmbJXx5loCQ9bCkeYLKmiuhUHx8JA-WIU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=36455f5f487685021897f86fb95ca2d70152c682', 'width': 120}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My father is an addict and as such used Heroin and Meth for the past 10 or so years.

During Corona once I finished with my studies, I've decided to try Heroin and Meth, both separate times and even together. I took breaks in between days, to combat the dehydration that Meth wreaks on your body.
It comes as a shock to me that my father ended up overdosing a grand total of 9 times In my entire lifetime, with most being Heroin(and other drugs I cant remember, my apologies)

So my question is, how come some people overdose off drugs, yet others do not, even when they both do the same amount of drugs, if not more?

I really only know the basics of the drug, nothing more than that it’s kinda similar to acid. So these are my questions:

Should I take all 3.5 g? I’m 5’2” and about 110 lbs, if not what would you recommend?

Would it be better to stay inside and watch movies and do fun stuff or wait for a nice day to vibe outside?

Full stomach or empty stomach?

What can I expect for the visuals?

memantine is a dissociative, commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. 

the first time i took it was in brasil, 50mg. i felt very sluggish and weird throughout the day, a weird buzzing feeling, and feeling dissociated from my limbs. my mom noticed something was going on with me. wasnt particularly enjoyable and it was difficult to eat.

second time was still in brasil, at night, 100mg. that was a very enjoyable experience and i watched youtube videos while drinking soda for a good part of the night, enjoying the euphoria and slight visuals, until i went to sleep, where i could see trippy geometric shapes when i closed my eyes.

so i brought some back to canada! and me and my friends had a couple good nights on it (with weed)

then back in brasil, i had access to it again, 5th time, 120mg. **it was a nightmare.**  the come up was nice, starting to feel good, but then it suddenly got VERY intense, i was so dissociated, my whole body buzzing, that i threw up every time i moved. mind you the effects of memantine can last up to three days (usually 1-2 max from my experience) so i was scared!. i ended up being brought to a little emergency medical center they have in brasil (instead of hospitals for small towns) and they checked me out. they couldnt see what was wrong so they just gave me an IV and a couple anti-nausea pills. when i went back home (it had been about 6 hours since the come up by then) i just laid down and watched youtube, and later was able to eat and everything.

finally i took 50mg again in brasil, i wanted to ""detraumatize"" myself. it was pretty nice, i just stayed up playing minecraft for a while and enjoyed the high. this time i felt more stimulated by it and it kinda kept me awake, it also had less visuals and was more of a semi-enjoyable buzz",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,690991,public,confidence,self,Memantine experiences,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hk7mvy/memantine_experiences/,no_ads,0.0,1593759913.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If anyone has been able to deal with stim withdrawal on the job, what is the best way to do it?

I’ve been thinking a smaller dose of vyvanse in combination with caffeine could be effective for tapering down. I can’t drink coffee, so could energy drinks be a daily solution for my 7 hour shifts? I also have a slight dependence on e-cigs.

My first drink came when I was 26 and went to my dealers/best friends house and he put a shot of patron tequila in front of me and said “we’re going out tonight, if you want to come with us or you want any weed from me you will take the shot.” Needless to say I took the shot plus about 6 more that night and realized the next morning how much sunlight can hurt, regardless I started to enjoy drinking. After 3 years, I didn’t become an alcoholic like I always feared, I drink on the weekends and still don’t understand people who drink everyday. I do miss the days of just smoking weed though, where the feeling of getting so high from dabs that can barely talk is missed as I fear that is gone from trying drugs that get you higher.

Alcohol in general to me just seems like an add on to weed (which just shows how addicted to weed I am) because I don’t like drinking without it. I was wondering opinions from people who enjoy any drugs without alcohol being the legal high they fall back on, or just why don’t you enjoy drinking?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,690982,public,confidence,self,Those of us that take take drugs but don’t drink alcohol...,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hk64qz/those_of_us_that_take_take_drugs_but_dont_drink/,no_ads,0.0,1593754973.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wanted H but fuck it.i threw it away after the bump. I did a lil bump (my tolerance is low) then went home, I felt guilty for doing it so I told my gf within the same hr of doing it and coming home..i thought I'd be able to explain why and maybe she'd see that I'm hurting but it went completely south. Was alot of screaming in our studio apartment.  We had a neighbor write a note saying they will call the cops if they hear us again. I  was curled in the corner as she screamed at me telling me how selfish, and shitty I am for doing that to her. How I need to go to rehab and I'm fucking everything up. And legit would not let me talk. Said I broke her trust, I did tho. After my OD 2 wks ago I said I wouldn't. But I did. My mental health is so fucked up I just wanted to stop hurting. Stop the loud anxiety and depression in my head. I wanted to sleep, I hadn't slept for days and my bipolar was so bad my mood was switching every few minutes. I haven't been good. She's doing everything she can to help and I'm selfish asf and just want to get high to make my pain hurt. But I have noone. Even when I'm trying to stay clean and have urges I still feel like I'm getting in trouble for talking about it. Idk I'm hurting still. I cant tell her I had shit even after told her I didnt. I wanted to change and be honest about it cause I felt bad and guilty for it, then Itgot worse I immediately went in the bathroom and did again while I cried I'm sorry to her to myself. I hurt man. I want this anxiety to end. These horrible depressive and bipolar swings, not even for days..they switch every minute. I want to go to rehab but we risk losing our new apartment of only 4 months now. I can't leave but every second I'm here I think of drugs. I cant go outside without my street ppl talking or offering cause I look sick or crying. I want to go to rehab. But I lose everything and the one person I have again if I do. I know I've fucked her over and she kept asking me why our little family isn't enough (her and our 3 cats) i thought it was. I didnt use meth for 6 months. Only dide coke with her so I wouldn't go over board. Only smoke weed everyday. I dont drink but that's all I want cause it's cheaper. I didnt use H till recently. I'm sorry for the long rant. I dont have access to a therapist or psych or anything right now. And it's too much for her. What the fuck do I even do besides ""stop using"" I do need to stop. I want to be sober (besides weed) I want a better life. But I dont trust doctors. Idk. Sorry for the rant. I'm sure she will see this. I just csnt stop feeling so bad for using and I feel bad cause I cant control my shit. I want a bender. I want to run away and come back and it be over. I want to do NA/AA I want friends that aren't fucked up too. I want to like myself again and make her proud. I want her to not have to run the shit everyday like she does.

To cut a long story short, the ket ended up being MDMA. I only realised this about 4 keys into bashing it. For the record, I haven’t been a great fan of MDMA, even though the high is incredible (and I don’t doubt that), the comedowns for me just never justified the high. I had also pinged before so it didn’t seem all too bad at the time. Anyway so my mate left to go home and I was left to my own devices, jaw swinging and eyes rolling. For whatever reason, I thought it’d be a great idea to watch American Horror Story alone. Now I’m not claiming to be an alpha male, I had begun season 5 (hotel) a few days back and found it pretty unsettling, something about empty hallways and bricked up abandoned rooms just made my skin crawl, but I had started it and decided to continue it. To sum it up, don’t do this. I watched 2 episodes and pretty much began to believe this shit was real. The empathy for these fictional characters was so enhanced by the mandy that it did genuinely seem real in my head. Needless to say, I still can’t really watch season 5 without feeling that strange empathetic discomfort I felt that night. So in short, do something happy.

If someone was receiving a package in the mail from someone they don't know very well. He gave them a tracking number to a website that they am not sure is even real. [https://crystal-mail.com/](https://crystal-mail.com/)

The mail people first said they need 500$ for insurance which they paid in bitcoin. Then they said they need 400$ for a stamp that the package can't be opened. Which they again paid in bitcoin.

Now they are saying the package has been opened and they need to pay 2000$ for a medical license (this isn't a medical substance) or else the DEA will bust them. They are warning them about it and said they could pay 1500 - they told them they didn't have 2000.

Based on people experience does this seem real or are they just being scammed. they are nervous about getting in trouble but would prefer not to give them another 1500 if they don't have to and are just being scammed. Please help.

 Uber driver thought we were gonna rob him and we thought it was a kidnapping ...

This happened a little while ago so my recollection is a little hazy It was 3 of us all heading home from a party, we had planned to walk home through the woods but it had gotten dark and we were tired. I had only smoked some bud and dropped a tab (I had began to sober up though and was looking to be the trip sitter like usual) while one friend was on a average to low dose of kremadrin ( procyclidine ) and acid while the other friend was on acid and had smoked a lot of bud

I could tell the other two were to high to walk home so I called up my brother to give me a lift home, after a short wait he proceeds to pull up and we get in and we’re pulling off and I suddenly realise I don’t know this guy... never met him before, still tripping a little I panic and start msging my friends that I have no idea how driving. My friend on just acid msgs me back saying “😂 wtf” and then “wait, what?”

We’re msging each other saying we should just bail out the moving car, with the acid helping to increase the tension and overwhelm us with paranoia. I keep making eye contact with the driver in the mirror and I’m getting really anxious. I also msg my other friend not expecting him to be able to read/understand my msg, as he’s too high. We think this is a full on kidnapping and I’m about to call my brother when the driver suddenly says “look I don’t have any cash and I want no trouble “.  This where my friend on Kremadrin says “look mate a lot of us are broke but we don’t start kidnapping people” and at that point I see my friend (the one on Kremadrin ) has a knife out which had alarmed the driver ( don’t worry we don’t generally carry knives, it’s just one on his keys )

The driver is just straight up confused here and is not sure what’s going on and the sober part of me tells me we might be jumping the gun. So I ask who he is, he responds with something about us being crazy and that he’s an Uber driver. I continue to to grab the knife of my friend who is still holding it unable to follow what’s going on. 

Turns out my brother had asked an Uber driver he knew reasonably well to pick us up and told him where to drop us off and he also said that he would cover payment when he next uses the guy but I guess he didn’t understand that due to a language barrier, he did txt me all this but I didn’t see as I only use snapchat really

We’ve nearly arrived and I’ve phoned my brother and cleared things up, “so how much do I owe you then mate ?” Too fully become the worst customer ever I realise I don’t have my wallet. I tell him this and the cheeky bastard asks for my Louis Vuitton belt. It was only like a £20 journey. Then he says what about my watch, not interested in him going through every item of clothing, I take of my belt on the agreement that when my brother pays him he’ll give it back. 

We get out the car an my friend ( the kremadin one of course ) says “I am fuckkked, swear down I just imagined that we were getting kidnapped and I pulled a knife out an shit “ I hand him back the knife and say good night.

So I’m very sorry for frightening an innocent Uber driver, I got my belt back and I now read all my txt msgs. I also know not to accuse Uber drivers of being kidnappers but in all fairness who doesn’t greet their customers, actually we probably just didn’t hear him. Looking back on it I don’t think kidnappers generally just pull up in the hope a load of people will just jump in

Thanks for reading and yes my brother compensated the Uber driver very well

Btw in case you don’t know Kremadrin ( procylidine ) its a drug used to treat Parkinson’s and can be obtained with an online prescription, it’s a popular drug in my area and especially amongst my friends, it induces delirium but is much funner than delirium from DPH, Datura, etc due to it producing euphoria. That being said it’s still pretty dangerous to be delirious and it has a dangerously long duration.

I've done shrooms a few times in high school 12 years ago and twice within the last few months (always 2gs to 3.5gs). I remember the trips being a hell of a lot heavier when I was younger (17 yo) prepared to the last two times I've done them this year (it had been a ten plus year break). I would eat an eighth and have a spiritual experience in the woods. The last two times I ate 2gs and could barely call what I experienced a trip. It was more emotional than anything else. A mix of confusion, anxiety, and slight euphoria. It was enjoyable, but i dont know if it would be worth $40. I would eat the entire eighth this time rather than 2gs, but I dont expect the difference to be enormous (despite the guy saying these are much better).

I've tried acid twice. The first time it did nothing (probably fake) and the second time I lost my mind (in mostly a positive way) off of one hit. I was in high school and drugs affect you differently when your 18 vs when you're 30 so i dont know what to expect with acid as it's been over a decade. All I really remember about it is that the visuals were stronger and my grasp on reality was tenuous at best. I also remember getting tired of the trip and thinking ""when is this going to end?"". The last time I ate mushrooms a month or two ago, the effects lasted two maybe three hours, which was disappointing. That said, I dont want to take a hit of acid and trip balls for 12 hours.

I have to admit to being a little scared to try acid for the second time (more than 10 years since my first). I will be tripping alone in a small apartment. It'll probably be late evening/early night when I take or eat this so there won't be many people out if I decide to go for a walk along the river. That said it's a bad area so walking alone isn't the safest idea. Ill be under the influence so I obviously won't have a weapon on me. I walk at night whenever I need something from the store and I live in ypsilanti not Detroit so it's not *super* dangerous, but I wouldn't feel comfortable knowing one of girl friends (not in the dating sense) was walking by herself at night.

The eighth or shrooms is $40 while a hit is $10. I only say that so you get an idea of the quality. The money isn't a big issue.

She has major anxiety issues especially when doing basic things like grocery shopping or using public transport.

The problem is she isn't able to relax once she get's home, she sleeps poorly and she just never seems to be able to let her anxiety go for a second. When she finally get's some rest she's able to supress it for a while but thats no solution..

She had a lot of therapy and even though she has been making progress with handling her anxiety, she just didn't have a break from it in 4 years.
She's on anti depression meds but they don't seem to do much. 

I smoke weed every now and then and I do something psychedelic about every half year. She has tried both but it just isn't for her. Weed doesn't help her at all, neither does alcohol or cbd.
She tried diazepam once and that seems about the only thing that helped so far. But whe'd like more then one option.

She just wants to use something that makes her fear and struggle disapear for a day so she can catch a break every now and then. Preferably natural, but whe are willing to try something synthetic as well at this point. We were thinking once every two months at home in a safe surrounding, and I will be sober.
Just so she can catch a break and finally really let that stress go so she can take on the struggle for the rest of the days.

Could you guys share your experiences and help us out with some suggestions?
thanks in advance!

So for background, just under a decade and a half ago when I was in high school there was a rumour going around from diverse and credible sources that a group of kids from another school in town had made tea out of some flora they found growing on the hill their school sits atop. 

Details were scarce but I heard, and never questioned, that it was mushroom tea that they had made, thinking they had magic mushrooms on their hands. Unfortunately, they were wrong and ended up at the clinic. I think it may have even triggered a Drugs R Bad talk from our own teachers around the time but I can't remember anymore. I was the straightest of edges, so I would have no doubt nodded my solemn agreement.

Fast forward to the present, my straight edged ways long since abandoned, and what do I enounter on our beloved Erowid but an eerily familiar account of a Datura (not shroom)-fuelled nightmare. Set at a UWC? Check. Around the time I was at school? Check. Featuring a key nationality? Check. 

This must be how a detective feels when she solves a years old cold case. I don't even know if my friend will remember a random rumour from 13 years ago, but I thought it was a really fun surprise coming across a piece of high school lore randomly on Erowid. 

To be fair, I could be way off target here but it's an interesting thought at the every least.

To start I dont believe I gave the two people names in my previous story so let's call them dipshit and douchebag they were best friends. 

Dipshit was the younger brother of my best friend, and at the time I worked for their family's hydraulic hose company. But dipshits older brother was off to college when this occurred. So he asked me to hang with dipshit if I could to keep him away from friends who he would be doing percs with. I said sure because he was my best friend. 

So we were hanging out one night and we decided to get some coke and a bottle of 100 proof captain and go back to my place to do some drinkin, cokin and smokin. We had procured the liquor and i had the weed at home so all we needed was the coke. Dipshit said he knew who he could call.. ""douchebag""

Douchebag used to be a good friend of mine but after a heroin/perc addiction and shorting me on a couple bags of weed I kept my distance. At the time I would have associated with pretty much anyone to get my hands on some goood coke and this interaction was no different.

So me and Dipshit meet up with douchebag and he says we need to drop my car somewhere and he would take us to the guy. I suggested one of the numerous back country neighborhoods we lived around and he said no and was very stubborn about meeting in the Weis parking lot which should have set off my shit barometer  but like I said I would have done pretty much any number of sketchy things to aquire coke.

So reluctantly I leave my vehicle in the lot we get into his car and hop over the hill to allentown. We park at a very famous pizza place sports bar and he runs in comes back out in 5 minutes hes back in the car and boom we were good!

I could see the rest of my night with excitement as I felt the coke in my hand, 10 minutes back to my car 15 minutes back to my place then dipshit would roll up and grab some cokes for the rum as i chopped this shit up. Tops half hour before coke was running through my veins and heavy guitar music was screeching from my speakers and a smoking blunt perched between my fingers.

But I was damn wrong. By the time we got back to my car hopped in and started back towards my apartment I got a strange feeling in my stomach. We turned off 309 to 378 and an upper Saucon police car throws his lights on a whips around and is now following me. I panic and stash the coke between the seat and the center console. We pull into an orthodontist parking lot and dipshit is buggin..

Now let's pause real quick.. i always told dipshit to leave his percs out of my car because he'd roll around with like 50 30s on him at all times, which is like walking around with intent to distribute and i wanted no part of it. Pretty smart huh? Wrong I also used to roll around with a loaded gun in my glove box. Legal but concealed illegally. 

Back to the story, dipshit is bugging out, they come up pull him right out of the car and start searching him. The officer comes up to me and says to be patient because he made the stop for a plain clothes detective. Fuck. I knew I was done for. At this point the detective comes pulls me out of the car and starts grilling me. I'm not budging keeping my face straight even though I was freaking out inside. I looked over dipshit is crying now with all his shit on the hood of the cop car. 

Detective fuckface asked if I had anything in my car he should know about, I told him about the gun and that it was legally mine. I gave them permission to retrieve it without searching the vehicle. They asked if they could search i said no but they called the dogs from the next town over. And if the dogs smelled drugs they would impound my car. 

The cops then played games with me handcuffed, pushing me down saying sit down.. then the other guy would come and yank me to my feet saying I didnt tell you to sit down. Then the original guy came back and pushed me back down. That happened for about a half hour. Finally they put me in the back of the car, which I had been expecting since before I was even pulled out of the car.

The dogs came the detective pulled me out of the car and he said last chance to blame everything on dipshit. I looked at him confused. I later found out he had a feud with dipshit and couldn't wait to bring him down. I told him there was nothing in the car and if there was it was mine not dipshits. Dogs sniffed and confirmed they towed my car away and the detective said he'd be in touch and the left us in the parking lot.

I was so confused I though for sure I'd be endimg my night in jail. My phone was dead at this point dipshit called a friend, not douchebah though he wouldn't answer even though we called him like 20 times. I wonder why.

Dipshits friend picked us up and dropped us off at his jeep. Which we got into and immediately drove to pick up percs because he was having anxiety.. i was pissed to not be going straight home but had no other options. I didnt take any percs even though freebies were offered because of my stone cold performance with the detective. I probably should have becasue we finally got back to dipshits house and I couldn't sleep.. all night... 

I finally woke up dipshit at 6am and made him drive me home so I could smoke some weed and sleep.



A couple days later they called me at work and told me to come pick up the car, when i did I looked in between the seat and center console the coke was still there..holy fucking shit I was so excited and paranoid. I called off the rest of the day at work drove out of the upper Saucon jurisdiction watching in my rear view like a hawk. I finally got back to my apt and pulled the coke out i was so happy they didnt find it! So I went upstairs like any person in my situation would do.. I blew the whole fucking thing up my nose that night alone..

To solve the mystery my car was so messy they thought the bag of coke was trash and instead thought the dogs were barking at the roach they found in my ashtray. which must have been from a long time before because I hadn't smoked in my car since I started carrying the gun. 

I ended up being charged with illegally concealing a firearm and possession of one Marijuana cigarette. I plead down to 1 year probation thankfully the judge was smart and didnt listen to detectice fuckface who was trying to paint me as the ""gun weilding muscle"" of this prescription drug ring. But it came out in court there was a CI which was douchebag. I since have thrown him a beat down on the very first chance I had now we just don't talk.

I’m informed someone’s here to see me, and told to change into my blues and head to the control center. My mind races with guesses of who my visitors were, making me nearly giddy with anticipation.

My stomach plummets when my unexpected guests introduce themselves as Ann Arbor detectives conducting an investigation of a friend’s death. They show me texts from a phone listed as my contact number for probation, and pepper me with questions. Apparently, he overdosed, and our conversation from that day references drugs.

Ahhh fuck, I groan silently, as shit comes rushing back to me.

I don’t really say much in response to their million questions, only that “I guess I sent them,” alluding to the texts. I get the nascent feeling that I’m completely fucked, so I just ask what’s gonna happen next. The detective responds that it’s up to the prosecutor to pursue the charge of “delivery causing death.”

For two and half sleepless months, I wonder if I’m gonna get hit with this charge, and constantly rehearsing all the available evidence in my head, but decide to keep the problem to myself since nothing was official yet. I attend church and pray to God, making deals with Him that this charge won’t be brought up or come with a ton of time.

I finally told my family when I received a notification of an official warrant and was arraigned within a few weeks. At least, the angst of not knowing dissipated, and we hired a lawyer. Things started to improve from there.

But first, I need to confess how horrible I felt about what happened and my role in it, which I didnt connect to myself until the detectives, but at the same time, I didn’t feel 17 years bad. Overdose deaths happen all the time; after all, it’s an epidemic in this country. But for it to have happened to me, to be on this side of the equation as a user, just seemed to be more than just cruel luck, but a stroke of fate, as I recall the impossible cirumstances leading up to it.

Venting my troubles to a friend, asking rhetorically how a survivor of the same act can be held responsible for the death of the other, and he jokes, “Damn, how’d he get so lucky?” The fucked up thing is that I felt like that sometimes, the immensity of it was so overwhelming, that I wished our roles were reversed. A painless death seemed like a better fate than life imprisonment.

I worried that the prosecutor and judge would view me as some kingpin, which was laughably inaccurate. Sure, I sold pills in the past, and got coke for friends on certain occasions, but that was the extent of it. There’s a quote from Gene Wolfe’s “The Book of the New Sun”, which the narrator repeats, and it goes something like, “You always become what you pretend to be”, and I adopted the mantra as my own.

As the months elapsed, and the discovery was made available, my lawyer believed he could get the charge dismissed due to a lack of evidence, buoying my hopes.

But that hope was short-lived, as the effort ultimately proved unsuccessful; I was disconsolate for a brief period afterwards, as I slowly absorbed the idea that, yes, I was gonna have to do some time on this charge. I stopped going to church as abruptly as I had resumed. (Plus, it bothered me the service was almost exclusively attended by chomos, who need to point to their conversion when facing parole board. But in prison, you’re lumped in with the people you’re surrounded by.) I unfairly lashed out at friends and family, who nevertheless handled my outbursts with compassion. But I eventually regained my courage. Alright, game time, let’s let the lawyers negotiate. After all, this is what he got the big bucks for.

I had heard of and met a few prisoners with this same charge who got 5-7 years, so I hoped the opening deal was at or just a bit above 10 years, so we could negotiate our way down to 5 and below. 

But when the first deal came back at 17 years, I couldnt catch my breath from the body blow. That’s a lifetime! It slowly became clear the parents were (understandably) out for blood, and in these cases, their input was critical to deciding the final sentence (e.g. with their support, I could get one year). I knew this was gonna be an ugly battle. 

I was split between recognizing, and mourning, his premature, unfair death and defending myself…it’s not like I loaded and then injected him with a needle. My actual actions deserved a handful of years at worst. If I had been driving drunk and crashed into and killed him, I would’ve faced a less severe sentence; those offenders routinely got 6 or 7 and I knew someone who got a measly 2. Moreover, bars and liquor stores that sold the booze to someone who died in a drunk driving accident were not held criminally liable for serving the victim.

The many degrees of separation between us were not distant enough to avoid criminal responsibility. (Our laws are fucked up like that; in response to the opioid epidemic, prosecutors have aggressively pursued these drug-induced homicide cases more often than they used to, and since 2014, the 50% increase in charges have all been against fellow users rather than actual dealers, you know, the types of guys with a trail of bodies in their wake from cutting their dope with fentanyl.)

We tried to get the feds to pick up the case in exchange for cooperation. I know what youre thinking but at this point, was it really telling if the guy I was telling on was the dealer who had already cooperated with police to set me up on the case leading to my present incarceration? I thought not, obviously, and figured any rules about not being a snitch no longer applied after he told on me (and went to extraordinary lengths to do so).

As their investigation unfolded, it slowly became clear that same guy had been cooperating with a few local police departments in exchange for practical immunity, as they just overlooked his many transgressions, despite being the type to transport a key of fent. Police do shit like this all the time and then wonder why people hate them. Since it depended on the U.S. attorney’s office to pick up the case, and they work notoriously slow, it eventually became clear this option would not avail itself in time.

As trial neared, my hope for the prosecutor to play ball proved futile, as he begrudged us a 15 year agreement. That was terrible. Going to trial seemed inevitable, and then, in case I was found guilty, hope the judge stayed at the bottom range of the guidelines, which would’ve been 10 years at best.

Then I met with my lawyer, and we devised a plan, but it was a long shot. Since she had previously sentenced someone to a year in addition to drug court, and another to 5, we hoped that if I pled guilty without an agreement, what’s known as a blind plea, and throw myself at the mercy of the court, there was no reason she wouldn’t give me a sentence around 5 years. In lieu of a Cobb’s agreement, my lawyer thought she would go lower if I had a chance to explain my side, and she had the time to review all the facts in front of her, instead of a two minute argument in the middle of court.

So I went about writing my version of events to her, which coincidentally, was the only true account of what happened. I was dissatisfied with my first attempts but then the coronavirus broke out and my court date was postponed indefinitely.

After a two month hiatus, court resumed, albeit, without my knowledge. I randomly got a callout for court in the control center, and my pretrial was held over video and broadcasted on YouTube after a one week postponement. I quietly pled guilty.

I took another look at my previous efforts at my letter. I had written term papers before where, if I had not got an A, I wouldve received a terrible grade. So much more was riding on this; this was literally my life on the line. The pressure narrowed my focus– I hammered it out over two days. I included as much as I felt was necessary to convey the true story. Here is what I submitted:

[copy and paste my letter here. make sure to set it off with a block quote]

My interview with the probation agent for the presentence investigation, or PSI, which was a description of the crime, my history, and a sentence recommendation, went swimmingly. Although sympathetic, she asked for 10 years, which was near the low end of the guidelines.

So, on the day of sentencing, I was nervous as hell as my life hung in the balance. I knew the prosecutor would be asking for a lot of time, but also knew that 10 year recommendation held much more weight. I was fully prepared for receiving that, but hoped my letter and the dozen or so character witness statements on my behalf would sway her towards leniency. Clearly, we argued, I didn’t deserve a harsh sentence, fuck what the guidelines say.

The parents gave heart-rending statements, especially the mom, and I became poignantly aware of the indelible consequences on other people’s lives from what happened. However, you could tell they were naive, and had no knowledge of the severity of their son’s drug use. In some ways, I knew him better than they did. My own parents knew where they were coming from; at first, they wanted to believe it was everyone else’s fault but my own. 

Next, my lawyer spoke and made a lot of the points I couldn’t make without seeming heartless and remoreless…such as, it was his decision, he had multiple drugs in his system, I overdosed as well, etc. He finished by asking for 5 and below. Then I made my statement, rehashing much of what was said in the letter, and asked for forgiveness.

Finally, the judge spoke. She mentioned my letter and asked the prosecutor if he had read it, which he had, and if he gave a copy to the parents, which he hadnt. It was a scum bag move. The judge, obviously chagrined at his (strategic) negligence, recommended that the parents read it to glean some answers about what had happened, and learn how this came about, and thereby, start coming to peace with it. 

She declared that neither party would be happy with her decision, and gave her judgment: 8 years with time credit. That left me with six. I audibly sighed with relief, as I had wholeheartedly thought 10 (and briefly, after the victims’ testimony, more than that) and had believed anything below that would be a long shot. It was literally on threshold of what I deemed acceptable. Actually, my lawyer was upset, because he thought she should have given me 5. And he’s right, she should have, but I wouldnt press the issue in appeals.

There were a few reasons for that number. Not wanting to look like she was picking sides, I listed 4-7 years as reasonable in my letter. Also, if the parents had read my letter, they probably would’ve been a little more forgiving, knowing that I wasn’t some heartless drug dealer. Most of all, my current charge made her look at me unfavorably; I knew I should’ve gone the extra lengths to explain the fluke.

Regardlessly, I was relieved. She noted how much of the prosecutors’ recommendation resulted from some sense of vengeful retribution, and that she had to consider my higher-than-average probability of successful rehabilitation.

Afterwards, I was elated this ordeal was finally over with, the possibility of spending most of my life in prison hung over my head for almost a year. Hell, I wasn’t even able to laugh for months following the detectives’ initial visit. I saw them at the beginning of November, and didn’t break out in genuine laughter until March.

Now I started to grapple with someone losing their life partly because of something I did. Sure, I’m a pretty sympathetic offender as a fellow user, but still, I felt horrible.

Like I told the judge, I wish I could go back in time. The main thing I would change is that I would’ve stood my ground against Bigs and fought back…fuck it, even if he had a gun. However, I had a warrant for failing to check in to rehab at the time, and feared the police would get involved (hence, why I never did get them involved despite a few occurences begging for their intervention). I wish I had checked into rehab. Most importantly, I wish I never gave him any dope. 

This might send trite and selfish but I also thought about what people would think of me because of this. But that fear quickly evaporated; it was too late for embarrassment. I was way past that point, and whether I wanted to or not, I would have to deal with the ramifications. I remembered the Nietzschean injunction to embrace my fate rather than fighting it.

I was reading a book about a guy taking a legendary class on the classics, and he talks about Oedipus and the lengths he goes to to avoid a horrible prophecy. His efforts to avert his fate lead him directly to its fulfillment. In the same way, this was like the last thing I thought could possibly happen to me.

And although I am in a lot of ways, I dont feel like an entirely different person than I was at the time these events happened. It’s still the same “I” underneath all this bullshit, and I’m amazed I’ve endured all this without becoming irrevocably bitter or completely loathsome.

The links between one another are taut and fragile, like a spider’s web, and we’re all our brother’s keeper. Probably because I listened to the Gorillaz song “On Melancholy Hill” at the time, it plays on like background music or the theme song to everything that happened, underscoring the tragedy and loneliness of it all. Likewise, I think of the last few, poetic paragraphs of Joyce’s “The Dead” as the epigraph, a meditation on how the snow drifts down on us all, living and dead alike.

Now, I’ve a prison bit to do…it’s like I’m taking time off from my life to improve myself before reentering society. I hope I can do it right this time.

Would love some advice on a first-time LSD trip next weekend. 

Interested in exploring the creative side so I’ll have my iPad (airplane mode) for drawing and some colored pencils and paper for sketching. 

We’ll be in a private Airbnb near nature so I plan to sit outside and listen to music for some of it (recommendations welcome - anything synthy, electronic, or instrumental)

Dose: 1 tab — assuming it’s 100ug, could be 200ug? I’ll be testing for purity but wasn’t able to find out exact dosage. Should I start by cutting in half and re-dosing?

Having a longtime trusted friend sitting - he doesn’t use anything himself but is a very level-headed person and doesn’t judge my use. Any concise suggested reading I can share? 

I’ve done shrooms a few times before (5-8g dried each time). First two were very positive experiences but recent one was challenging (early this year) — wasn’t in the best headspace for it and ended up getting stuck on some upsetting thought loops. I don’t expect that to be much a problem this time but am aware it can happen.

Other than that, smoke weed regularly (not planning to mix) and have done molly a few times so altered state experiences aren’t entirely new. 

Feeling reasonably confident and pretty excited about this overall.

Because of my job people have gotten hurt because of me, regardless of the morality I was directly responsible for a close friend getting hurt.

I’ll think in my peripheral vision the tv remote but it’ll resemble a gun and I will just get a sudden wave of anxiety, 

I’ve have tripped several times but it doesn’t go away and when I see certain faces, or things which remind me of violence and I’m over whelmed by guilt.

I also have a scar and if I look at it on a high dose i get this really sinister uncomfortable feeling and I here laughing in my head. Despite what it sounds I’m not insane I do understand it’s all just a potent drug reflecting my inner thoughts (the laughing isn’t genuine laughter, it’s sinister) but I just want to know how to stop it 

The final thing is I hate the concept of money when tripping and I’ve been tempted to burn money before, it’s like a second version of me takes control who hates the sober mes principles 

I’ve tried embracing it

I’ve tried running from it

I’ve tried thinking it over

I’ve tried giving it time

Nothings worked and every trip I have at times I am just constantly reminded of past events, I’ve tried virtually all drugs but specifically LSD and psychedelics have an evil underlying tone for me and I’m envious of the euphoric and peaceful trips you all have, not to say I’ve never had a good trip I have but there’s always parts which I do not enjoy

My coworker was a lowkey dealer, and since I had never tried weed (I was 22 y/o, way late to the party), I bought some to see what the hype was about. The first two times I tried smoking nothing happened. Looking back it was surely because I wasn't inhaling. So, I figured I was immune to weed but I gave it a thrid try anyway. I ripped my bowl in my yard a few times, and just as the first two tries, nothing happened. At this point I was fully convinced that weed didn't work on me, which was disappointing but so be it. I walked back to my house, which took a minute or so, and right as I went through the door...

My entire vision got this red tint and things were literally warping, like everything was changing size and it was like how things kind of move then snap back into place, comparable to being dizzy. My heart was going absolutely crazy. I could feel the warmth and pressure on my chest, which really scared me. I was in the basement, so I had to crawl up the stairs to get to my room because my balance was nonexistent. I managed to make it there and lay in my bed, at which point I put on my headphones to listen to some music. As I was listening, I had this extremely vivid closed eye halicination of a jungle tribe dancing around a fire. Don't ask me why lol. That's the last thing I remember so guess I fell asleep after that.

I woke up the next day and I still felt stoned. That's very strange since I smoked maybe 8 hours ago. I had work so when I got there I asked my coworker/dealer if weed is supposed to last this long. He was like what the fuck? It should last a few hours at most. So I'm not sure why I was high for so long.

The government permits its citizens to consume certain drugs. Let's look at what's permitted:

- Alchohol
- Cigarette
- Energy drinks
- Pharmaceutical drugs

What does they all have in common?
They are all manmade.

All are full of secondary effects, sometimes really bad.

Now, all natural drugs are illegal-
Magic mushroom, salvia, dmt and cannabis are provided freely by Mother Earth with all kind of benefits, talked about and respected for thousand of years and yet... it is a crime to consume them.

I say again...
It is crime to consume Mother Earth...

How fucked up is that?

The truth is all of them makes you think out of the box. They change your perspective about the world and they don't want that because if it was legal and a vast majority of people would consume them there would be a major awakening.

We would all realize the big lie we live in.

When potentiating substances, make sure you use at least 25% less than your normal dose of the substanc being potentiated. This allows you to get a feel for how the substance is potentiated and reduces the possibility of overdose

LSD/LSA potentiation:
- Noopept: potentiates LSD by about 3 times according to myself and many others anecdotal experience (can cause some anxiety for some)
- Coluracetam: strong potentiator of lysergamides, coluracetam appears to have potentiation effects on psychs and dissos comparable to that of noopept, which suggests (along with the fact that coluracetam increases acetylcholine production) that coluracetam may be more similar to noopept than any racetams
- Piracetam: potentiates LSD by about 1.5 times
- Fasoracetam: minimal testing done on this combo but it appears to potentiate lsd by about 2 times
- Huperzine A, CDP choline, Alpha GPC: make the experience feel more magical and enhances thought processing and visuals
- note: Aniracetam appears to be the one racetam that significantly dulls psychedelics (possibly due to decreasing 5HT2a binding affinity) 

Amphetamine potentiation:
- 1/4 tsp baking soda or tums 0-30 minutes before dosing (acidity increases excretion of amphetamines and decreases length of high as well as worsens comedown)
- Agmatine: potentiates the euphoria and overall experience; noticeably increases length of beneficial effects for me (*Dose low on the agmatine: 250-500 mg; more can dull euphoria)
- low dose memantine (5-20 mg)
- low dose dxm (30-60 mg; more is hard on the heart) 
- Turmeric w black pepper/piperine: increase euphoria and smoothen out the experience; decreases comedown
- Magnesium: Mild NMDA antagonist; helps lessen tolerance buildup as well as reduces bruxism
- NAC (low dose only; 400-600 mg before and redose when comedown becomes uncomfortable): NAC aids in reducing dopamine depletion from amps and reduces the comedown significantly for me
- Huperzine A: Increased euphoria and cognitive effects, brings back the magic for me. Very good to mix for a study session
- Yerba mate: Mild MAOI; noticeably enhances effects and feels much better than other forms of caffeine on amp
- Other sources of caffeine
- Racetams: unpredictable potentiation, can cause anger or too much stimulation for some. Mixing racetams and amphetamines could also potentially cause glutamate excitoxicty, so i dont recommend mixing them (if you do mix them, take creatine and/or low dose memantine with it because both aid with glutamate excitoxicity. note: creatine is more effective for reducing glutamate excitoxicity). Fasoracetam and coluracetam enhance amphetamine the best ime

Opiate potentiation:
- Quercetin (250-500 mg 30-60 min before dosing. *Use caution when mixing quercetin with opis as there is evidence to suggest quercetin is effective at reversing opi tolerance
- 30-60 mg DXM 30-60 minutes before dosing
- 5-20 mg memantine 3-4 hrs before dosing
- 25-50 mg DPH, hydroxyzine, or promethazine 30-60 minutes before dosing
- Agmatine:  potentiates the pain relieving qualities and increases length of substance (*Dose low on the agmatine: 250-500 mg; more can dull euphoria)
- Tagamet/cimetidine 30-60 minutes before dosing, inhibits liver enzymes
- Grapefruit juice or grapefruit seed extract for liver enzyme inhibition
- Turmeric with black pepper: enzyme inhibition 
- Blackseed oil or extract: enhances euphoria, length, anxiolysis and analgesia
- For fat soluble opis (kratom, hydrocodone, codeine, tramadol): fatty snack or drink 20-30 minutes after dosing
*Tramadol: Start with either 50 or 100 mg, and redose 50 mg every 30 minutes after initial dose for maximum high, fatty snack 20-30 minutes after first tramadol dose here helps tremendously with the increase in absorption. Stagger 50 mg redoses every 30 minutes up to 300 mg tramadol total.

DXM and possibly other NMDA antagonist potentiation:
- Blackseed extract or oil: Strong potentiator of all aspects of DXM ime, enhanced anxiolysis as well
- White grapefruit juice or grapefruit seed extract for liver enzyme inhibition 
- Lysine (amino acid): appears to potentiate DXM anecdotally and subjectively; possibly due to lysine’s 5HT4 antagonism. Lysine increases the dissociation and euphoria significantly for me, id highly suggest the combo due to how cheap lysine is in powder form. Its possible i experienced potentiation of memantine from lysine but i havent gotten to trial that again.
- Noopept: increases DXM visuals and improves cognition while on DXM and allows for increased trip memory retainment (5-15 mg is sufficient)
- Coluracetam: Increases DXM visuals a lot and enhances antidepressant effects as well as improving trip memory retainment (10-20 mg is a good dose)
- 25-100 mg DPH for liver enzyme inhibition and visual potentiation (can make DXM feel too dirty for some) 

Cannabis potentiation:
- Turmeric with black pepper/piperine: consume 30+ minutes before cannabis
- External sources of terpenes from plants and herbs (lemongrass for myrcene, thyme for thymol)
- Anandamide containing substances such as cacao
- External sources of cannabinoids including nutmeg, kava, dark chocolate, and ceylon cinnamon

Benzos:
- Turmeric with black pepper/piperine: Enhances anxiolysis and 
- Blackseed extract or oil: Increases overall effects and length. Enhances anxiolysis and provides some euphoria
- Lemon balm or ashwagandha: GABAergic herbal adaptogens that improve the overall experience and increase euphoria and anxiolysis
- Kava: Gabaergic
 - Agmatine: Enhances anxiolysis and increases length (dose low: 250 mg should be enough, more may decrease desired effects)

Phenibut and gabapentin (possibly pregablin/lyrica as well):
- Agmatine: Enhances anxiety relief and euphoria (low dose only; 250-500 mg is all you need)
- NAC (N-acetyl cysteine): Enhances anxiety relief and body high/warmth, strong potentiator for me (only use 400-600 mg for potentiation). NAC modulates glutamate and dopamine
- Acidic substances consumed while dosing (coffee, lemon/lime jucie in water, etc)
- Fatty snack consumed 15-30 minutes after dosing (only for gabap or pregab, not phenibut)
- Staggering doses appears to increse the efffects of both of these substances; split phenibut dose in half and dose each half with on hour seperating the doses. Stagger gabapentin in 300-600 mg intervals each 30 minutes for best results (increases bioavailability)",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,690911,public,confidence,self,The ultimate drug potentiation guide [Updated],0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hk0yiv/the_ultimate_drug_potentiation_guide_updated/,no_ads,0.0,1593738579.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten years ago she got hooked on OxyContin and abused that for a few years, going to outpatient rehab and seemingly getting better. She eventually got an apartment with a roommate and seemed OK for a few months. Until she apparently couldn’t afford it anymore and had to move back in with my parents. Well it turns out her money was going to heroin and she had started shooting up. So she goes to methadone outpatient rehab again and has been in that for 3 years. In the past year she relapsed again and seems to be smoking heroin now. She recently revealed to me she also has been addicted to Xanax for a few years now and buys 125 pills at a time because she uses 1-4 a day. She is now 30 years old, recently unemployed due to poor job performance, has next to no money, and is living with my parents. My parents have been supporting her this whole time and generally believing every word she’s said about being clean. They’ve even helped her out with stuff like her unpaid car registration or fixing her transmission ($4000) because they believed she was “trying to save up.” My parents are not well off, over 65, and in my opinion have enabled her for years. In just the past few weeks (since getting laid off), my sister has turned Michael Jackson-esque with outlandish, scatterbrained behavior. Up at odd hours of the night, clumsy as hell, barely able to talk, no short term memory (she got into a heated argument with my mom yesterday and a few hours later didn’t remember it). We don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do. With covid, inpatient rehab (covered by insurance) seems hard to get into and private inpatient is not something any of us can afford. Tldr: sister is on heroin and Xanax and getting worse by the day with parents supporting her financially

I went through a gram of coke (like really really good stuff, promise you) on Sunday night, didn't fall asleep until Monday 3pm. 

Tuesday night did 200mg of the same coke and felt it only for like 10-20 minutes. Took 8mg etizolam to come down.
 
Yesterday the menu consisted of roughly (pressed) 40mg of diazepam, but I got way too sloppy and decided to take 89mg of this same speed I'm talking about and it pulled me out of the benzo sloppiness pretty quick. Over the course of the evening (up until 5am, I couldn't sleep, took 4mg at 4:30 to make it 14 total. So took 14mg of etizolam total and wasn't even really that fucked up in the evening, and I have no idea how I stayed up until 5 because all I took was that 89mg. 

Now this morning I was a little slurry with my words but that was at like 10am, now it's 4pm. Totally felt sober before taking this 100mg of speed.

One thing I just don't understand is why everyone on the listing gives rave reviews like best quality and all that but it doesn't seem to do shit to me.

I do notice though that it takes me a lot of coke, or speed in the past to actually get that rolling feeling because I suspect I have a good case of undiagnosed ADD

my question here is, since I’m literally feeling no effects whatsoever off 100mg of “95%” speed , would it be fine (and would I feel anything) to take another 100mg of it? Or should I have some coke instead since I have some left?

I decided to watch Lord of the rings during the trip, as I've heard ""you feel like you are in the movie"" on ket and I'd be down for being an orc killing badass.

During the scene with the fellowship trying to cross the mountains and Saruman is bringing down an avalanche. This is when the ket really hit.

Was I to be a hero? Maybe a bad guy even? No. I was the mountain. I felt huge and heavy and Saruman was trying to bring down the ice and snow on the fellowship. I was having ""the drip"" and i didn't dare to swallow as the avalanche would fall down then. It was a trying time for me as a mountain. I felt like I had let everyone down when the snow fell. I was a bad mountain. I cried snow flakes.

1) you can redose like once every two hours without having a  REAL crash. You are focused and don't look like a toxic individual. You have a moderate fun if you swallow around 50mg but obviously you will have to redose around at least 20 one hour after or crash is assured. Orally taken never experienced euphoria yet, just more alertness, talkativity, productivity and getting things done. Great also to drink something with it to smooth it. Downside: orally it stays in your blood for hours, so if you plan an evening out, I have to take 10mg xanax to sleep. This is the real annoying part.

Pros of Coke (and I am used lavishly to 92% and up purity):
1) you just inhale it, immediate rush, redosing needed no longer than half an hour. Less focus but more happy/active immediate euphoria. In my opinion totally an evening substance, or you are going to be a zombie if you start at lunch time, even small doses end up feeling uncomfortable unless you plan to have at least a couple of strong drinks while using it. Than it's just pleasurable. But again come on, it is an evening stuff. Ritalin can be used all day long in prescription dosage; unluckily I made the mistake to swallow around 60mg afternoon/evening, and, as orally stays longer in your blood than inhaled coke, it takes me 10 mg of xanax to finally sleep, vs 5/6 after around 1 gram of coke and a few cocktails. So it is actually faster to sleep with some help after coke than ritalin.
The answer is: if you snort Ritalin, does it go away faster so that I don't need 2 hours to finally sleep instead of taking it orally? Coke is supposed to be similar but harder, though I sleep faster, so I made the guess oral is what makes difficult sleep after an oral ritalin while after 30 mins coke is easy to forget in 10 mins after a few xanax. Opinion correct?
ps does anyone know whether there are real feeling differences between snorting coke or ritalin?

I also moved out my grandparents house and flew to Denver last November to be with a girl I had fallen head over fucking heels in love with just to be left by her the day I got there for another man, and then I ended up meeting some people at the hotel I had booked there that happened to know some really big connects out there that became close friends of mine and I proceeded to stay in colorado where I became homeless and sleeping behind dumpsters at seedy motels for about 8 months. I went from being a depressed sad little emo closet user who never left his room and spent everyday alone and had never stolen or never shared needles before to being homeless 600 miles from anyone I knew, spending a week in jail for a felony drug charge for the first time ever in my life, befriending drug traffickers and criminals who I considered almost like family to me, learning CPR from 911 operators on the spot while resuscitating someone from a heroin overdose that was from a shot that I myself actually gave them, began boosting felonious amounts of electronics from stores to basically give away to my junkie friends in hopes of gaining their acceptance, I was also shooting up this girl who I stayed with for awhiles bloody shots that she couldn't get to stay in her veins, I also knowingly gave myself hep c because I needed a rig and the only ones around were old rigs that I new had been used by someone who had hep c already. And I did this all while still chasing the same girl I went out there for who could never seem to decide whether she wanted me or not. I'm back in my home state now, have been for a month, everyone has cut me off here, I lost everything and everyone, I checked myself into rehab for the first time since I went to Denver last week because I was convinced I was done using after everything I've put myself thru , and I left not even 3 days in again. What the fuck is wrong with me, why is it that i cant feel anything when I'm sober, I cant feel sad or happy or any sort of pleasure. Nothing but guilt, shame, and anger. It's like if I'm not high there's a piece of my soul missing , but when I use again all I feel is fucking hopelessness and a yearning for the inevitable end. I'm thinking about just going back to Denver to live out the rest of my time doing the same shit I was before because it's like a part of me misses that turmoil, it feels like that's all that I know now..

Most people seem to just take turns with the canister/balloon. 

What I do is fill up a bunch of balloons and have everyone hold theirs until everyone has one. Then we choose a song to play, take three deep breaths together, then inhale the balloon (and rebreath into the balloon a few times). I've done this before with like 10 people at once sitting in a circle. Usually it's like 4 or 5 tho.

They said ""I abuse my pills"" as distinct from addiction.  Certainly we all know you can abuse drugs without the addiction.  I tend to think that's something you would equate with high-dose occasional use of legit RX pharms, or using popular illicit drugs with some frequency, etc.

Is there no grey area at all?  This is something that keeps happening to me.  I find folks look at a few particular sentences of what I'm saying and conclude ""it's clearly abuse"" and nothing I said before, or after, the allegation will change their mind on it.

Somehow the allegations bother me.  I'm not sure if what bothers me is ""being an abuser who knows it, and must deny it"" or if it goes against what I actually believe, that being:  what I have falls under a ""grey area"" and is not entirely binary.

I think at the end of the day, what matters most is what I believe.  And I usually prefer to be literalist and honest to myself.  There were 2 times in my life that I was a terrible drug addict and the proof was in the pudding, my health was worsening but I didn't care.  I kept using no matter what happened.  I could never lie to myself about that--yes I was an addict, even though I never sought help until later on.  And after that--yes, I became an alcoholic.  Never denied it to myself.

Am I an abuser of RX drugs now?  If I happen to use the RX drug (Gabapentin) for the nerve pain and headache, but ""also because I like the buzz"" does the needle by default strike ""abuse""?  How many say yes, how many say ""not exactly""?  Keep in mind I rarely increase the dose, at that.

I'm sure I'm not alone on this sub when it comes to spending lockdown getting routinely spangled. Unfortunately, all good things must end and The Line demands labour sacrifice or we're alll going to starve or something. My time ends this weekend so I thought I'd reflect on the highlights of this time being consistently not sober (without having to pretend to be sober for appearances) 

I'm going to miss the death of bedtime the most. Spending days awake bouncing around between relentless video game sessions; weeding my garden at 5am; some fantastic stim fuelled sex; being able to make edibles which totalled us for about 3 days; chain smoking all night while playing cards against humanity that we created with our own cards; dicking around on my guitar whenever I want and constantly being around my cats has been a welcome break from the monotony of full time work.

I am terrified of returning to working in hospitality (serving increasingly uninhibited crowds of people more alcohol.....) but fuck that noise! 

What are your best wavey lockdown stories? 

- Those edibles I cooked were so strong they cause sporadic full body organisms for one of us

- I also got PPE shamed by my weed guy who was rocking a full mask, apron and gloves. 

- I played Fallout 4 for about 50 hours straight on a stim binge and found all different the ways to break it


- I celebrated the end of a toxic relationship that should have died a year ago, by hooking up with an old flame (we've now parted ways because this was a very intense proximity period and we have our own shit to do independently before diving into something else) 

- My cat had kittens because vets aren't able to do neuterings, but kittens are great so I'm good with it


Over to you guys!

Also interested to hear differences in neurotypical folks or other disorders.

&amp;#x200B;

i wrote these based off of my two potential states of mind: hyperfocus/flow (rare) VS constantly being pulled from one thought to the next against my will (pretty much always). 

&amp;#x200B;

Adderall (prescribed) - makes it easier to get to hyperfocus on things that are normally too boring or too much effort. but this can also hyper focus me on unproductive things like reddit, video game, etc.  still an issue with switching from one thing to the next (usually puts you in a flow state of what you’re doing when it hits, so waiting in bed for it to hit is detrimental unless I have to be somewhere to make me move and get started). 

THC - mildly psychedelic in that it lets me take a step back and see what it is my thoughts are doing. Seeing this can help me keep focus by recognizing I’ve gotten distracted but also makes all thoughts more enticing, so its a double edged sword. Definitely good for breaking negative rumination.  Can also quiet thoughts a bit and make it easier to get into creative flow-states (like playing music).

MDMA- this is the ultimate flow state. It's the epitome of being content doing exactly what i'm doing right now and feeling “thoughtless” . With no pull or need to go do or thing elsewhere (other than fun stuff like lightshows Vics pops which I get excited and motivated to do and then immediately fulfill the need and return to contentless. 

LSD - a million thoughts all equally exciting and hard to hold on to. first trip I was seeing/experiencing like a stacking of thoughts/going up on a ladder deeper into a thought and then the ""ADD gravity"" pulls me back down and I say ""woah wtf and start the climb all over again."" I can see how getting into a flow state on lsd would be a totally different experience which I have not yet really had. In a nutshell, it exaggerates all thoughts and feelings while putting you in a perspective where you can view them from third person in 3d 

Psilocybin -MUCH less extent of the same (could be due to dosage). In my experiences sits equally between weed and lsd potency wise. In the lower doses could be more just fun and giggly if hanging out with friends (itself a flow state with right people). When I did it for reflection it definitely let me take a step out of rumination and had a kind of gentle voice saying it was ok and im ok exactly where I am now. 

Cocaine - can hyper focus more easily on a conversations/games but thought of redosing immediately becomes most urgent and important upon arising and makes it very hard to think about anything else once it arises 

Alcohol - this one quiets thoughts which is nice but also just makes me act on every impulse without thinking about it beforehand (not so nice). 

Nicotine - for a second i'm content to just hit the vape. When the thought to hit it pops up it immediately becomes the more important one. Literally just a fleeting dose of dopamine. 

Nos - I'm either spaced out in bliss w no thoughts or follow one super exciting and incredible thought to a mind-blowing and ineffable conclusion and right when i try to articulate it to myself I'm back to baseline. 

K - honestly have a hard time figuring out what the fuck this one does to me at all but I think it makes me get pulled down the ""thought ladder"" at much lower rungs. like I start having a thought and then and immediately fall off and get confused about what I was just thinking and decide I prob don’t need to think anything and wow everything is weird but i'm pretty content right where I am. Def quiets the constant jibber jabber of thoughts.

I'm 19 which is the minimum age to buy alcohol and weed here, both which are legal.

I take a few different types of antidepressants. I know that they can cause issues with thc so I only smoke about once a month. All it does is make me lethargic and eat way more than I should.

I'm interested in trying acid and/or Salvia. Maybe shrooms. Some type of psychedelic. 

Should I do it alone? Will I have a higher likelihood of a bad trip? Will there be any permanent or long lasting effects? Will it be different than if I weren't on them? Will it last a different amount of time?

What made me write this is today's experience I went through.

So basically I never had this problem before but it happened for the first time like in February I think, when I got into a really bad trip on weed because I smoked way too much and I thought I was dying and that I was having a heart attack. Anxiety and panic attack mixed. I survived it, of course, then moved on, started smoking again after that, didn't even thought about stopping since I thought I just greened out. Whenever I would go outside to smoke or take drugs with someone anywhere else except in my home and alone I would be absolutely fine. But after that day, whenever I smoked at my home I would get the same feeling. Anxiety rush, feeling like u are dying and having a heart attack, panicking, greening out. Last time I smoked alone at my home was like idk 3 months ago because I stopped doing it since it's causing me this problem.

I thought that's only weed until today. (Since I never did drugs alone, only with someone and also outside.) 

 I went to my friends house, we snorted some amphetamine (speed) and I was zooted so much but still I was fine and I enjoyed my time. After we finished and after I spent some time at his place, I went straight to my house. I came home, and immediately I got some weird feeling in my stomach and in my head. I went to my room, and first 5-10 minutes were fine, but then I got the same feeling I got while panicking on weed, feeling like I'm dying, overheating and having a heart attack. Same fucking shit. I don't know what this is guys and why is it like this. 

And by the way I have preexisting problems with my mental health, I have ADHD, bipolar disorder and anxiety. Recently I also triggered depersonalization, since the quarantine started so yeah. But as I said I have no problems doing anything with anyone, but whenever I'm alone I get the same feeling every time and I panic so much. 

Do you guys know what this could be? Any help, tip, opinion, comment, literally anything would mean a lot.

It was a totally amazing and eclectic experience and we both felt very euphoric. 

I have taken shrooms twice two years ago and both times were eye-opening, life changing and very much needed for me then. This was my fiancé’s first time doing any type of psychedelics. During my trips then, both times when my high was peaking, I felt 30/40 mins of fixation and paranoia about something that was bothering me (now that I think about this, I wonder if it was due to the weed I smoked during the come up). I was initially worried this might be the case with LSD too and I did not get that type of intense paranoia. We both took 125mcg tabs. I vaped some indica (very little) on the come up and it helped me ease into the trip. He did not but we decided we would do what felt most comfortable and natural for us. 

The beginning of easing into the trip was probably my least liked part. I had a very hard time regulating my body temp. I was sweating a lot but eventually got over that hump. 

Eventually when we both started feeling the effects of the acid, we both for a very long time could not stop laughing. Everything and anything was funny but to another level. Every time I looked at my fiancé, I would just lose any composure I had and bust out into laughter. We listened to music and that was a big mood booster. We watched some Netflix (shows we love/make us laugh) and laughed more. During this time we were enjoying our trip, we oscillated back and forth from different parts of our home. For me, being on the balcony and listening to music was my favorite. But different parts of our trip accompanied by different settings was perfect. At some point, we ended up back in the bedroom playing GTA which was so sick. 

Mixed into all of this tripping madness was also the issue of eating. It was not pleasant. I love my Mary Jane and also love food. My fiancé and I have always associated being high with eating comfort/good food. Man, did eating leave much to desire when you’re tripping. For us, it felt really difficult to chew and deal with the sensation of the food in our mouths. We also were laughing uncontrollably during this time and I could not even look at my fiancé while taking a bite because I would break out into laughter. Is eating and tripping on acid not a good combo? Has anyone else felt this way? 

Once we started on the come down, many hours later, we did consume more weeds. This worked for us and we did not feel any discomfort, if anything helped to continue the trip! But we both recommend that if you are not familiar with weed and mixing it with other things, to take it slow. I feel that we were lucky this time and got to figure out how to mix weed with LSD and not fuck it up. I was hesitant at first to mix but ultimately I’m very glad I could enjoy both. 

All in all, the experience was more amazing than both of us imagine or expected to be. I feel really grateful and lucky to have tripped with my best friend and soulmate. The love we felt was consuming and put a magnifying glass to what we feel on the daily for each other. Doing this with someone you feel 110% comfortable with this makes it all the worth while. There were times we listened to music, closed our eyes, had our feet up on a chair and touching (opposite of each other), then would move our feet to the best of the music. We both felt we could communicate with our energies(???) without having to really talk. We are both very much looking forward to doing this again together. 

For those who are on the edge of trying, it is worth it. The most important thing is that you go into it with intentions. Before we tripped, we wrote on our whiteboard three things we wanted out of our time; love, happiness and discovery. Though they are vague, it was the perfect guide to keep us on the right track. There is a lot I didn’t write in this post but it has been now 15 hours now since I dropped acid.

This is a condensed story of my life. I share this only to help others who may have been where I was:

My father had ALS and died when I was 12. It was a suspected homicide by my mother who is now in jail for life. I was turned over to my Uncle and Aunt who turned out to be emotionally abusive. After being kicked out of the house the summer before college, I was all on my own. They did not know of my drug abuse. Ever since my dad was diagnosed with ALS, a spark has been ignited in my soul to pursue medicine. However, drugs may prevent me from my goal. 

I started experimenting with drugs when I was 16- DXM. I was well versed on harm reduction and an avid member of the harm reduction forum Bluelight. However, not too long after I was introduced to the beautiful world of opiates. After wisdom tooth surgery, hydrocodone was bliss. It took away a lot of the emotional pain I was feeling at the time. I realized that I started to take them solely for recreational use and not for pain. I then gave them to my Aunt. I continued to abuse DXM for a long time. Shortly before I graduated high school I began stealing hydrocodone from the medicine cabinet. Then I started stealing vyvanse as well. 

After being kicked out on the streets for a few weeks before college, I was introduced to many other drugs. In addition, college introduced me to basically everything under the sun. I've pretty much done everything except meth and heroin. Ahh: opiates, LSD, molly, PCP, bath salts, coke, alcohol, weed, adderall (and other stims), shrooms, and many more. There were many fun times with friends, but now I think I've had my fun. 

Opiates however remained my favorite. I'm in college as a Biochemistry major hoping to reach medical school. I've been taking an EMT course and in two weeks will take my National Exam. Getting employment requires being clean; and in the EMT field staying clean (random tests).

I'm stuck and need help. I'm diagnosed with Bipolar type 2, PTSD, and social anxiety (aspergers). Doing drugs and opiates is not worth ruining my whole life goal. However, I feel this existential dread about getting a job since I will not be able to enjoy drugs in a responsible way ever again. I feel like it is either the drugs or my life career at this point. 

From today on my goal is to get clean from everything except my prescription medications (and the occasional psychedelic). I love my other passions such as horses. I feel like I've fallen away from my other passions since drugs became so prevalent in my life. 

Any advice? I feel daunted by this new commitment.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,690748,public,confidence,self,Officially Quitting Drugs to Pursue the Career of my Life,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hjogrf/officially_quitting_drugs_to_pursue_the_career_of/,no_ads,0.0,1593684983.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a bad back, I take Fent and sometimes Oxy as well to deal with the pain, if I don't take the pain meds I'm limited in how long I can even stand up or walk, once seated the pain tends to dial back a bit.  But it seems my pain is a factor of time, the longer I stand  walk, the more it's going to go from a pain level of 4 then 5 then 6 then 10.  But taking the pain meds slows this progression so I can get things done in my day with less need to sit/lay down.    


Problem now is those meds also tend to make me a bit unfocused and tired so again I feel like I'm confined/limited in what I can do throughout the day.  I'm going to be talking to my doc about adding adderall to the mix to see if that can bring me up to actually enjoy having less back pain and be able to get more done.  What are the risks involved in this?  


To be clear, I wear my fent patch for 3 days once applied and never take Oxy after about 3pm in the afternoon or I at least stay awake for 6 hours after the oxy, so I don't have any issues falling asleep and dropping off the planet.  I would use Adderall in the same way, once in the morning would be ideal just to get my day going, I drink coffee presently but it doesn't help counter the fent/oxy side effects.   


If there are options other than adderall I'd be glad to get input here and discuss them with my doc after hearing from the community.

So, I am currently in a class about drugs at my school, and I have to write a final paper (it's summer classes, so you know how fast things go) about a drug and how it affects people. We basically got assigned a drug at random to research on. My drug was K2 or synthetic weed. I am going to school in New York City so I see how K2 affects the homeless population on a daily basis. It breaks my heart seeing drug-induced people, because I know they have dealt with so much pain, and looking for a way to escape. However, this paper.. I have to include a section about the affects of K2 and, honestly, I've had so many people in my life excuse many different behaviors on K2, I'm not sure what the true affect is. On my way home from work, I see many people (usually Black, which breaks my heart because I am also Black) just PASSED OUT on the street. People blame it on K2. Then I'll see more people get on the train who are just absolutely ""boosted up"", to put in their words, and people still blame it on K2. I really need to know what the affects of K2 are like. How can you identify if someone is on K2? I feel like people blame behaviors that are common with heroin and PCP on K2. And I know they are complete opposites, but people genuinely think if you are either acting like a zombie or if you are absolutely WILDING out, then it K2... no inbetween. I'm here to get the truth on what the affects are and how you can identify someone is on it for my paper.

1) you can redose like once every two hours without having a  REAL crash. You are focused and don't look like a toxic individual. You have a moderate fun if you swallow around 50mg but obviously you will have to redose around at least 20 one hour after or crash is assured. Orally taken never experienced euphoria yet, just more alertness, talkativity, productivity and getting things done. Great also to drink something with it to smooth it. Downside: orally it stays in your blood for hours, so if you plan an evening out, I have to take 10mg xanax to sleep. This is the real annoying part.

Pros of Coke (and I am used lavishly to 92% and up purity):
1) you just inhale it, immediate rush, redosing needed no longer than half an hour. Less focus but more happy/active immediate euphoria. In my opinion totally an evening substance, or you are going to be a zombie if you start at lunch time, even small doses end up feeling uncomfortable unless you plan to have at least a couple of strong drinks while using it. Than it's just pleasurable. But again come on, it is an evening stuff. Ritalin can be used all day long in prescription dosage; unluckily I made the mistake to swallow around 60mg afternoon/evening, and, as orally stays longer in your blood than inhaled coke, it takes me 10 mg of xanax to finally sleep, vs 5/6 after around 1 gram of coke and a few cocktails. So it is actually faster to sleep with some help after coke than ritalin.
The answer is: if you snort Ritalin, does it go away faster so that I don't need 2 hours to finally sleep instead of taking it orally? Coke is supposed to be similar but harder, though I sleep faster, so I made the guess oral is what makes difficult sleep after an oral ritalin while after 30 mins coke is easy to forget in 10 mins after a few xanax. Opinion correct?
ps does anyone know whether there are real feeling differences between snorting coke or ritalin?

SNRIs are just like SSRIs antidepressants for depression and anxiety. I was on Cymbalta (duloxetine) 90mg 4 days ago and took 2g phenibut daily (WARNING: dumb and risky). It was amazing just kind of limitless except for some limits, the side effects:
- I slept 0-3 hrs every night but it seemed to be okay for me, noradrenaline always present
- I couldn‘t eat much and had no appetite most of the time
- I couldn‘t ejaculate anymore, only if I had very hard sex for at least 2 hours

So these also were there reasons why I decided to quit. Even if I was the best type of me I could ever imagine. And I started thinking about and working on great things like biopsychology, neuroscience or political things like left wing and child pedophilia and trafficking problems. I also did a lot of music.

You also must know that phenibut alone doesn‘t give much magic and that the Cymbalta alone didn‘t give me any effects except for the side effects. The only effect was coming from combing them. I still don‘t understand that, maybe someone of you guys with more pharmalogical knowledge can explain this phenomenon.

Now I quit and I chose a very bad time for it as I‘m in a very stressful time of my university right now.

Even when I first started smoking marijuana at 14 years old and had no tolerance, weed never felt like an euphoric party drug to me. I absolutely love the high and prefer Mary Jane to alcohol in every possible way, however even strong sativa strains just make me relaxed and extremely in touch with my surroundings. I love how cannabis alters my sensorial perceptions and changes the way I think and make logical connections. Nevertheless it’s never felt like a strong euphoriant to me. Meanwhile alcohol, a drug I overall hate because of the stupid things it’s made me do and the awful comedown I always have after drinking, does feel however more energizing and euphoric. 

However most of my friends don’t agree, they think weed beats alcohol in terms of fucked-up-ness, which seems so weird to me. I’ve attended so many of my lectures while high and apart from making me a little slower it doesn’t really affect how functional I am and how I present myself. Whereas I can’t even fanthom doing anything like that in a drunken state, pissed me isn’t me, my drunk self is this hyperactive retard with no inhibition whatsoever.

Before anyone mentions it, I have been crossfaded many many times. In fact I very rarely drink without smoking weed as well.

My plug hyped up this new product that just randomly popped up called a Burst, they come in different flavors and they are disposable thc vapes that look very similar to puff bars. I know tons of people who have been getting them.

My experience with this vape has been different to any other drug experience I have had even with other cartridges that were fake. 

It starts off with a normal thc-like but the thc high lasts very little and is not very strong.  What also happened as soon as I started was immediate chest pain, trouble breathing, and a incredibly fast heart rate that’s higher than anything I have ever tried.  

The high goes away, and I feel tired, but the rest of my body  I cannot keep still from the weird sensations and sharp electric chest pains while my heart is going like 400 miles a minute. 

This is not me greening out nor having anxiety. I have smoked a lot of weed before and while I have greened out or had anxiety I have never had these kind of physical effects.  I have also used this product multiple times getting the same effect each time. 

With this experience, this will probably be my last time fucking around with a fake cart.  It feels like some kind of mix between THC and a stimulant.

The company who made this vape goes by their Instagram handle advertised on the box as @Burstconcentrates 

The packaging is extremely sketchy too.  There’s barely anything on the internet about them except a couple of r/fakecartridges reddit posts, one of them from me, and a youtube video of a guy trying one and seemingly having a normal weed experience.  I have also messaged some of my friends who have also tried it and they had the same exact symptoms as me. 

Does anyone have any idea what could be causing these effects?  I’m still having a racing heartbeat and electric feeling chest pains throughout even though I used it hours ago for the last time.

I am 16 and have never tripped on dxm before but I have tripped on acid and shrooms numerous times. I think about 13-15 times in total.

The day started with me stealing some delsyum from the store. Just atypical shit y'know. Who actually buys these things?

I downed the bottle at 7:57, my family was having a barbeque. And I mixed the bottle of 5oz delsyum (888mg) with some orange juice. 

I didn't feel much of anything until 9:20. I went inside and felt a little buzzed y'know. My body felt light and my stress literally went away. I remember telling my cousin that he's great and I love him. And this was the first indicator of what tonight was going to be like.

I went back outside from using the restroom and I talked at the bonfire, then hugged my mom and told her I was going to bed. This was at about 9:50. The first plateau was just getting stronger every minute. I hugged my mom for a particularly long time and she realized it but didn't say anything.

I went inside and while my cousin took a shower I watched some TV. I think I watched disjointed and I remember just slowly getting more and more slumpt. My body didn't feel like I expected. I felt like I was on a pain killer and my limbs didn't feel attached to my body. Rather just hanging on. But that feeling was faint. It would get worse later.

I went back outsidee after my aunt went inside. So it was just me and my mom. And she asked me what was wrong and it was odd, Because I completely opened up. I talked about addiction and how I felt like it still plagues my life because I've been off and on with drugs since 5th grade. It's been a struggle and mom told me something I never realized I needed to hear. ""You are not a burden on the family, we want to help you heal. We see your struggle."" And me and my mother both hugged and sobbed into each other's arms.

She then preformed a reiki treatment on me. I didn't really believe it but I went with it for love. I remember just trying to enjoy the time I had with my mother. She gave this treatment and described the mass amount of pain I was radiating. I was thinking all about how much pain and trouble my drug problems have cause me. And I tried getting rid of all of it. Letting the pain go. I was crying but not consciously. Tears were just flowing as I was sitting next to this bonfire with my mother giving me this opportunity.

After this I went inside and standing up I realized just how high I was. My body moved in weird an awkward ways. My limbs felt like they hung from my body. And I remember I couldn't feel anything at all. It felt like I had painkillers in my system. I remember walking through the dark and using only memory to walk. Thank God my mom couldn't see me stumble through the darkness as I walked inside and to my room I remember falling into my bed. My cousin was sleeping on the floor on a air mattress. I couldn't feel heat or cold as I lied down. I slept on top of the matress and passed out.

This is an extremely uncommon occurrence for me as I’m deathly afraid of going into psychosis again (caused be sleep deprivation/adderall/weed); however, the kpin just wouldn’t knock me out but I felt great so I just stayed up on it instead of trying to fight it.

I burned a small piece of bread in the microwave, but it was being warmed up on top of a plastic part for our blender (the ones for smoothies)

Here's links to the images of the plastic. 

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/v1obp621jgcjf2g/20200701\_161359.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v1obp621jgcjf2g/20200701_161359.jpg?dl=0)

The bread was partially blackened so I know it burned but the plastic only slightly discolored and looks like there's some micro-bubbles from melting. That's where the burnt bread part made contact with the plastic. Yes I know it was stupid but normally I don't forget the microwave on an auto-minute timer, I stop it in 10 seconds. Don't ask me why I'm using a piece from a blender lid to warm up my bread...

**Anyway**, I came here because I breathed in a little of the smoke and it feels EXACTLY like a weed high and was wondering if you guys think it's from the plastic or something in the bread. Ingredients: flour, olive oil, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom (about 3/4 or 1 tsp of each in a 2lb loaf), sugar, salt, yeast, water.

I am wondering if it's more likely the plastic or the bread that gave me this high.

I am desperate for any sort of advice/help.. maybe if you have been in similar shoes as me. Thank you.

I am 19 and started using benzos, alcohol, weed and other pills at 16. I got addicted to benzos for like 5 months daily at age 16. Hell. 

Got my own apartment at age 18 and thats when everything went fucking downhill. Keep in mind at age 16-18 I had close to 100K on my bank account. I could afford everything I wanted, every drugs I wanted and as long as I wanted.

Got my own apartment, start smoking weed daily. Pills daily. I was using many different pills, benzos, opiates. Not addicted to anything specific.

I spent about 5k a fucking month on drugs, takeaway food and stupid purchases. I was alone 24/7 and thought I am going to die doing this so I did not care. Somehow I survived and said fuck it I will move back in with my mom beause I wouldve died and blew all my money.

&amp;#x200B;

I am hopeless right now. This is the most healthiest drug use ive had, I excersise and try to do everything to improve myself. I know the reason of my drug use (trauma, emotional pain, anxiety, depression). My depression has never been this bad.

Every day I cry like two times a day if possible because crying is not easy for me. Im full of anxiety.

I have nobody to talk to in my life about these type of problems. I dont even know my mother, we dont have a [relationshi](https://relationship.My)p. My whole life I was alone 24/7. I had to mature up fast.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont wanna leave this earth. I have dreams and everything else and I know what im capable of.

But I am not capable of working on my online businesses or video editing which could make me 10-20k a month easy. I have no motivation to do anything, maybe because I have no motivation to live?

&amp;#x200B;

The fuck im going to do? I see myself going down and down. I have no faith, I am hopeless and just cry and feel like my head exploding.

I feel like just starting to use drugs again. When I was on drugs I had a normal social life, productivity and life was good. When I am sober my mind is full of hate of myself, negative thoughts. I cant explain this. I am not diagnosed of anything but could have PTSD as well and so many fucking problems.

There is barely any people who care about me, not even my mother or dad. Who can I talk to? 

&amp;#x200B;

The fuck im going to do? As I said I never in life was actively suicidal but these couple days have really been the worst. Like actually thinking to myself to kill myself because this pain I might not be able to take.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate myself. No love for myself. I am losing thousands of dollars constantly, spending and because I am not working on any businesses. I just sit at my room doing nothing. Its all I can do.

&amp;#x200B;

Losing all my potential away. I dont fucking know. Just posted this if someone could share advice because I have zero hope. I dont wanna leave but every day it seems like thats the only option I can take. 

&amp;#x200B;

I cant explain the pain inside my head. Me and my mom dont have a relationship, I dont love my mom. I dont love my dad, I hate him. Nobody. 

And sorry for weird writing since I took a 2mg xanax to get this anxiety out of me and negative thoughts. Thank you again if you choose to read this and offer any help.

I started to smoke twice a day for months and doing other drugs in terrible environments, my first encounter with psychedelics was a micro dosage at school. I know how stupid that is but I didn’t care at all, I just wanted to have fun and not feel what I was feeling. 

The night I did the molly was bad, my friends hit up this dude and bought about 3 grams of it. I took a fairly large rock and just feel into a very manic state. We stayed up the whole night talking about our emotions and at that very night is when I started to actually notice the pain I was feeling. I vented to all my friends for hours, I finally put away my ego and told them everything and they supported me. I’m not saying that shit is a god for help me it, it just helped me realize I need to stop and I have. I haven’t done anything hardcore for months as I’ve slowed back on my smoking. I’m not 100 percent healed from my heartbreak but I’m slowly processing it and I’m so happy I’m starting to get more in touch with myself. Don’t do shady drugs guys.

That’s not me I truly don’t care for attention. Okay so I’m 19 years old right now. As a kid so smoked weed probably had my first hit at 13 and had it 3-4 times a year in small amounts. It really wasn’t that serious until I moved out at 17. 

So I was 17 and I was turning 18 in about 2 months. I did this because I had the opportunity to move in with my girlfriend of 1 year and so I did. By the time we found the apartment and moved in and I found a job, so basically when we first got comfortable where we were I was 18 and a half. That’s when I started to look more into weed. My girlfriend worked at Texas Roadhouse so she had a plug for weed who gave her good prices. I’m not going to argue. He was a good guy and he’d invite me over to do coke and smoke a little weed with him and his baby momma would watch the kids, she was a great woman also. But that’s besides the point. So then I started doing a little coke. I did it twice with him and once when I bought some from him. While I was at hit house with my girlfriend and he was with his he offered us coke a Xanax and some brandy. So we all did that and I absolutely loved it. I just love being able to not give a shit. 

Don’t get me wrong I’m not depressed. I don’t feel like I need drugs to try and escape because I’m happy where I am right now. I have two jobs and I have my now fiancé. But I still want to use these drugs. My favorite drugs right now are weed lsd and coke. I’m 19 and a half I smoke weed everyday and I do acid whenever it’s available every few days. Would this qualify me as addicted? If it does what should I do about it? Please don’t be dicks and just say “just stop doing the drugs” because like I said I’m happy in life and I just do these responsibly just for fun. I just don’t know if this would be considered addicted.

And I have to say, I quite like it.

The sort-of dysphoric “what the fuck is going on” is just my cup of tea, I guess.

I just love the feeling of instant ego-death where as soon as you lay down the pipe, you completely forget your human form and “fall back into everything.” As I call it.

I feel like most people who hate on salvia had the same experience;

* It was one of the first psychedelics and they had no idea what the fuck they were getting in to

* They started with a super high concentrate (like 80x)

* They did it in a very bad environment (like a party)

I can fucking imagine that salvia would be terrifying given any one of those factors.

For those that have written off salvia entirely (due to experiencing it in the manner I described above), I really urge you to give it another chance. Only this time treating it with the respect it deserves.

* Try a lower-strength extract (10-20x)

* Smoke it alone in silence or with **one** trusted friend that you know will leave you the fuck alone. Seriously, this is probably the biggest factor. Your surroundings greatly influence your trip so it’s best to have as little going on around you as possible. 

* And finally; **SURRENDER** As soon as you lay  down your pipe or bong, lay *your* ass down. Kick back. And just let the salvia take over. Submit. Submit. Submit. Just stare at the ceiling. Don’t try to look around and make sense of your new environment. You can’t. Don’t try to move around.

I have only taken one class on the pharmacodynamics of psychoactive drugs and understand how must drugs work, but i’ve been having trouble finding resources to help me understand how kratom works. I understand that it has some effects on the opioid, dopamine, and serotonin receptors, but i still have a few questions. 
1) Dopamine re-uptake inhibitor, or does it stimulate effluent from the vesicles?
2) is it a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, or does it stimulate effluent from the vesicles? 
3) what is the action on the opiate receptors, and is it a partial or full agonist?
4) does effect the norepinephrine receptor in any way?
5) what is the addictive potential?
6) what negative effects can daily use have on your body, more specifically the liver?

I’m wondering because I suffer from panic disorder and visual processing/attention deficit disorder.  I have been taking SSRIs (sertraline) ans Adderall (dexamphetamine) for years. Recently, I took 3 grams of kratom before i went to work and felt much better all around, and for the past month I have been using kratom daily.

The original plan was to only smoke weed but on a whim I decided to also take along some lorazepam, 2.5mg sublingual tablets, that I still had laying around. The last time I took Benzos was when I had a prescription at 15 for Bromazepam.  

We sat down by the river that runs through our city. I broke one of the tablets in half and put it under my tongue. I didn't expect the effects to kick in quite as fast but the already pretty good, relaxed, and slightly euphoric mood I was in got kicked up all the way to 11 in less than 2 minutes. Alongside that came a really noticeable ""I don't give a fuck"" attitude, not in a ""I want to look for fights"" kind of way but rather so that I really only cared about myself and having fun in the moment.  

&amp;#x200B;

After sitting there for a couple more minutes we decided to head out and climb up a nearby parking garage. The way the parking garage is set up is so that cars can drive in on street level and 3 floors above that pedestrians can cross a bridge over to another street.  

We lit up one of the two joints I brought along and each had a couple tokes. All of a sudden we see a police car drive down the street in front of the parking garage and enter the garage itself. We both decided to book it across the pedestrian bridge and lose anyone following us in the streets. 

One thing I absolutely noticed here is the runners high. Since high school I've been a competitive athlete that spends anywhere between 4-6 days every week working out. Runners, or exercise induced, high is a feeling where you feel the exhaustion, the lungs or muscles burning and the general sense of fatigue from whatever exercise you're doing but since your body releases a huge amount of endorphins alongside it, it actually feels pretty good. Long story short I instantly got one of the best runner highs I ever received from any exercise. While my buddy, who hadn't taken any lorazepam, was struggling to keep running and noticeably feeling bad I was laughing and having the time of my life. No thought was spent on what would happen if the cops actually got us.  

&amp;#x200B;

We eventually left the area and spent the next half hour or so in a nearby park finishing the one joint that we couldn't finish thanks to ours friends in blue.  

&amp;#x200B;

After finishing up we decided to leave the park again. A few minutes later we entered an intersection and found ourselves with a cop car directly in front of us on the other side of the intersection. My buddy instantly booked it back and up the hill we came from. For me again there was no feeling of being scared and trying to run away, I really felt invincible. As if it's the most natural thing in the world I simply walked a couple more steps, ""noticed"" my shoes being untied and quickly stuck the remaining joint into the brackets of a rainwater pipe on the side of a building. I don't think the cops saw my buddy who ran away and they didn't bother me. 20 minutes later we returned the joint and finished our evening by smoking it.

What are **drugs**? They are things that amplify your experience in life at the cost of your health. The reason drugs are banned is because they cause problems to your health which then affects how much money you can make for the government.

Drugs open your eyes from the false reality which we are meant to live. False reality is meant for us to make money for our whole life until we die. In false reality everything has a price tag and you will become an outcast if you don't enough money.

Drugs make you wake up from the bad dream of false reality, and face the corrupted world that is beneath the covers. Now that you've come to the actual reality which is dark and worthless place. It is hard for you to express yourself, because everything you think and say are thought as crazy talk.

You know that you're not crazy for thinking like this since your eyes opened, but the government now sees you as a threat to capitalism. Government has these rules on how to diagnose someone as psychically ill. You are diagnosed as insane person, because the society needs to run in false reality and you are threat to it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Gateway of the ABYSS**

How does the world interpret gateway drug? It is a drug like cannabis which makes you prone to try harder drugs. In my opinion that should not be the definition for the word at all. What gateway drug really means, is that when you try this drug the gate behind you closes. You are unable to go back to what your life was before going through that gate. You are now conscious of the reality.

You start crumbling bit by bit once you've opened the gateway as the society constantly reminds you that you're a failure in life. You try your best to hold the growing agony inside you which makes you lose parts of yourselves slowly over time. These moments can be visualized for example a conversation where someone in the party mentions drugs. You instantly put a mask on your face to filter the agony inside you. It makes you lie to society by making you hide the fact that you've opened the gate.

The gateway is the way to find the real you by making you question everything in your being and existence. Learn to use the masks which you've gained throughout your journey through life. Those masks are your way of life from now on, until you can find the meaning for life. Only then can you peel off your final mask and face forward to the true world by opening the gateway of the abyss.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,690609,public,confidence,self,"Drugs, the truth they're trying to hide.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hj9ncc/drugs_the_truth_theyre_trying_to_hide/,no_ads,0.0,1593636991.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Did I jump in balls deep? so I removed the timed release capsule and used an old pokemon card to make a pile of adderall itself and disposed of the capsules. I then licked it all off my comic book and like 10-20 minutes later i just remember taking my puppy out and everything was so colorful, I saw new beauty in EVERYTHING, the grass was so grass like, the wooden fence was so textured, and my puppy was softer, the birds were amazing, the clouds, even the cars out in the road were mind blowing! So I went inside and I cuddled my puppy, feeling very euphoric. Then time just escaped and. He went into his crate and me and my brother entered our rooms for the night. At this point I believe I was at the peak of the experience! So I stared out my window for a while watching the amazing and colourful trees sway from side to side in the wind. I then asked my brother if I could look out his window and I watched the Forest in Awe. I was feeling great! I then went back to my room and walked to the window when I had noticed that there was a mess on my desk, floor, dresser, and floor so I came over and cleaned it all! My formerly messy room is clean and so well organized! I remember feeling a pretty good euphoria and I had felt like I was almost not doing anything, pure enjoyment! My arms were moving so fast and so efficiently my room is almost too clean now! Torwards the end I attempted to get a worthwhile high so I watched some pornographic films but, alas my ding dong was limp. So I rushed around my room cleaning everything, I must have done two weeks worth of work in an hour with ease, all the while extremely happy and slightly giggly. I kept cleaning everything, picking lint out of the carpet, organizing batteries, wiping my TV down, and playing chess with myself (I did win if it matters) when i realized my 4 hours were almost out so I looked around and saw it was clearly to clean for me, a 14 year old slob so I quickly went around keeping everything organised but making it appear as messy as possible and it did not end so soon so I was still euphoric for a good hour and a half. I then cleaned everything further and then admired the texture that wood has! I played with legos and cleaned more. But then it was too long. I noticed the high should have ended an hour and a half ago! I then became quite sad because my euphoric state was coming to a bitter end. At this point my room was absolutely perfect but alas it ended and now I am my sad self again.

Has anyone of you tried to make a lottion with fresh brugmansias

When i smoke it, i usually break my flowers without gloves, the simple fact of touching it constanly and rubbing it in my fingers gets me relaxed, in a good mood and makes me be in foccus.

With the simple act of smelling it under my nose for something around 1 minute gives me a lightheaded feeling.

If i did and perfume, some of the active compounds would be extracted on the alcohol, as they are easily soluble on alcohol

And they used brugmansia tinctires in the past for sleeping problems and get some light visuals.

Could i make a slightly intoxicating perfume, that not only could i feel, but people around me too?

The mothership (the source) sends us souls to this planet who they feel worthy of. They are awareness or just isness working through us.
Due to karmic principles some souls end up looping on this planet for lifetimes until they hit a state of awakening, In which they can break the cycle.
We are in a vessel known as our body and here to fulfil certain life missions for the betterment of mother earth. If we aren't working for the betterment, we are contributing to the lag of our planet.
This month (June) is a special time on this planet apparently [probably cause it's the month I'm born in haha]. I've never felt more alive. I feel I am a fungi on this rock. Our energy is like spores interacting with nature and accordingly manifestating into realities based on our intentions. Each thought we have fractulizes. Where thought goes, energy flows. Love is all encompassing and necessary for the survival of this planet. Science is a way to understand nature, a way to connect back to the mothership or try deduce an explanation for it. The nature of our excistance is musical, the whole solar system is singing and we are singing/vibrating with it into infinity (Aum). Nature repeats cycles (death/rebirth) and works through geometry which can be understood better.  To realize that we are stardust on this floating rock, connected to everything thing on a subatomic level is enlightening and can really make us wonder what our purpose is on this rock. Once a being hits this self realized state, it becomes they're mission to help others reach it as well. We aren't really ever born or die, we are just passing by. We our Divine beings having a human experience.

This is going to be long to get the basis of the story out, so if you read through I super appreciate it. I’ve tried talking to my friends but of course their reaction is basically “WHY ARE YOU DATING SOMEONE ON METH?!” And yeah well this is why:

We haven’t been together long, and we only recently reconnected after having had a month long fling back in November. I thought that something was “off” about him then, but he has really bad ADD and I kind of equated it to that. My anxiety makes me naturally a bit “quirky” so I have no judgement there. Maybe TMI and I apologize, but I also remember our sex the first time we met and as awesome as it was, he was never able to cum. He got super embarrassed at one point and told me it was because of his ADD medication, which lying on the bedside table, I understood and tried to make him feel better about it.

We ended up ending things because he said he had a lot going on and it seemed like we were moving fast and he wasn’t ready for that. I agreed as I was still questioning whether I wanted to be in a relationship myself so we ended on friendly terms. Over the next 6 months we talked here and there on Instagram, sending eachother memes back and forth. I want to note that I have done my fair share of drugs and I occasionally still dabble. So the idea of my partner doing drugs wasn’t something that bothered me, and we had talked briefly about this.

However, when we talked back then, he had taken a trip out of the country with his friends for a motorcycle rally. These things are notorious for partying and I expected as much. He told me he wanted to find some coke and I told him to be careful (again no issues because I do it too sometimes but being in another country I was a little worried for his safety). When he came back he joked with me about how he accidentally ended up purchasing meth because of the language barrier. I asked him how that was possible and what he did with it and he said he had done some, but kept the rest. I remember back then not really being sure what to think of that but he also wasn’t my boyfriend so it’s not like I could really get too upset about it, we were just a fling. 

Flash forward a month ago, we are on Instagram flirting back and forth and I mention that I am watching my moms house (which is close to him) all week while she is out of town and I’ve been wanting to party. I tell him I have some coke and even though he doesn’t drink, I would be and he could come hang out if he wanted. He mentioned also having “party favors” since it was the week of his birthday and I assumed this meant more coke, so we end up linking up and he comes over. We do the coke I have and go swimming and at one point I mention that I’m now out and maybe we could do some of his. He starts making lines and when I go to do some he stops me and says “you should know that isn’t coke.” I was confused and said “what do you mean?” And he tossed me a bag with a rock in it and said “well it’s this.”

I was drunk, and having done cocaine for the last 8 years on and off of my life, I figured I had probably dabbled in some mixed with meth before and didn’t see the big deal in it. So I did some with him. And that turned into us doing it all night. We never slept, and the next day I felt like complete garbage. We also did all of it and there was none left. I was pretty ashamed of myself but this is also typical me behavior when I’m partying I don’t really stop to think of the consequences. 

We end up spending the next few days together since my mom is out of town and really start to like eachother. We open up about how over the past six months apart, we have both been thinking a lot about eachother and discover that the strong feelings I thought I only had developing were being reciprocated (I had really really REALLY liked him back in November and was super bummed when we stopped talking, even though I thought it was best at the time). He tells me that he sees this as maybe a second chance and that he’s in a better place now, and in talking about the future he mentions that this week was what he wanted to be his last “party week” and he didn’t want to do that stuff anymore. I asked him if he did it often and he said he only did it occasionally when he wanted to party. He doesn’t drink and hasn’t for over a year. But I figured this was something he did recreationally when he was at the biker rallies he goes to and what not. I understand because I party too sometimes with my friends and will do coke for a few nights or molly or whatever happens. But the fact that he expressed wanting to quit and leave this life behind I felt a little better about because I mean, I’ve always considered meth to be pretty serious and after the night of doing it consistently, I knew I never wanted to do it again. 

Our next week consists of normal stuff like watching movies and cooking and nothing crazy like the first night. A few nights go by and one morning we wake up and he asks me what I want to do that day. We had spent the previous two days in bed basically having sex and watching tv that I think even though we were both enjoying eachothers company, we also felt like lazy pieces of shit. I start coming up with ideas, there’s not much to do because of the pandemic but nothing is really sticking. I’m pretty set on the idea of going for a hike somewhere and getting outside but he doesn’t seem to like the idea. Anyway, at one point he mentions that we could “party” again like the other night. At first, I’m like “yeah I could see if my friend has any blow but who knows how long it will take to get them to get it to me.” But I’m also still feeling the effects of the other night and not really into it. 

He then expresses that he isn’t really into the idea of doing coke because of all the fentanyl laced stuff going around. I agree somewhat but also explain to him that he watched me do it all day the other day and I’m fine. He then says he wants to “party” one last time for his birthday week and I realize what he means. He wants to get more meth because we did it all. I’m immediately uneasy with this idea and I KNOW that I don’t want to do it again because 1. I hate staying up all night. Even on cocaine I will eventually stop so I can go to sleep. On meth it was impossible to do that. 2. I felt like such trash the day after (which was also in part of the drinking I did I’m sure) but I just didn’t want to do it again and I had already made that decision the day of my hangover.  He then says “we don’t have to if you don’t want to, it’s just an idea.” I nicely tell him that I wouldn’t like to do that again and that he said he wanted to quit anyways so let’s just do something else.

Well an hour or so goes by and he kind of just outright says “it’s my birthday week and I want to do it again so I’m going to get some. You don’t have to do it if you don’t want to.” I was kind of in shock I didn’t know what to say, and yeah I guess this is where I’m an idiot, but I was basically like “fine do what you want.” So he leaves and goes searching for the guy because apparently he doesn’t have a phone he has to just drive around and find him. He comes back after an hour and a half and says he got some and starts doing lines. I don’t partake and am actually working on homework for the summer courses I’m taking and kind of leave him to do what he wants for the evening. 

He ends up doing it for most of the evening. It’s like laid on the bed side table and in between us having sex he pauses to do more and every time I feel a little more uneasy inside. Over the next 2 days he finishes the “new supply” he has. My mom is stuck out of state due to weather complications so we are going on a week and a half at this point of hanging out. I just keep telling myself that once he finishes this bag, that he won’t want to do it anymore and we’ll be good. When he does end up finishing this bag, I asked him if he was “ready to start his new life” so he had put it before, and he seemed pretty bleak about it and said “I guess.” The next two days that he is off it, he gets super irritable with me and even snaps at one point when we are trying to get my car to start that has died.

I thought it was an over the top reaction, but since he was also trying to quit smoking, I figured this was where it came from. I mean we had spent several days together when he finished the first bag and was without it and he was fine. So flash forward my mom comes home and I go back to my house and he to his. We both agree some time apart isn’t a bad idea as it’s not healthy to spend everyday with someone. But then he starts to become distant and is talking to me less. I go two whole days without him responding to me and one of these days we had plans to have dinner at my moms house (he had wanted to meet her and even though I thought it was soon I was happy that he wanted to). So I was pretty bummed he was acting so cold all of a sudden.

Eventually I get a hold of him and he tells me that he’s starting to get scared because he realizes he has serious feelings for me and doesn’t know what to do because his last relationship was terrible and he doesn’t want to hurt me etc. I convince him to meet up with me so we can talk in person even though its nearing midnight. We end up talking most the night and I seem to calm him down. At one point in our conversation I mention having taken an oxy earlier in the night that I had laying around because I was feeling sad (I probably do pills a couple days every few months if I somehow stumble upon them.) I was feeling sick to my stomach because I don’t do opiates a lot and he says “do you want something to wake you up?”
I ask him if he bought more of that stuff and he nods his head yes. I ask him why, I thought he wasn’t doing that anymore and he had said the party week was well over etc. He tells me he’s just having a bad week and that he needs it to function with his ADD sometimes.

At this point I don’t know what to say. I’m mad, but I’m also on drugs as we are having this conversation. But I also don’t them as often as he does and it is seeming like this “once in awhile” thing is more of a habit than he lead out to be. I start to think about the few texts I’d received from him the last few days and them mentioning how he was going “non stop” and had “too much to do”. I kind of put two and two together and realize that he was most likely on this stuff when he was ignoring me. At this point it’s 3am and he has to get up in 3 hours to meet his friends at the river to go tubing. He had invited me but I thought it best I didn’t go. He is falling asleep but I tell him that I don’t know if I can date someone who does this stuff as often as it seems he is. He is half asleep at this point but tells me he doesn’t do it all the time. I ask him if he thinks he has a problem and he kind of laughs and says “no I don’t think I have a problem. I just like to party sometimes.”

We end up falling asleep for a couple hours and when we wake up in the morning he gets up to start getting ready for his day trip. He tells me to just sleep in and I don’t have to rush out so I try to fall back asleep but I can’t. At one point I sit up to check my phone and he comes over to kiss me. When I look in his eyes I can see that he’s on it, and then continue to watch him while he gets ready. He’s buzzing all over the place and I just know that he’s on it. I go to the bathroom and notice a 5 dollar bill next to a shaving cream can and figure he must have crushed it up and snorted in the bathroom when I was trying to sleep.

At this point I’m feeling super sad and I decide to go home. He kisses me goodbye, oblivious to any of my emotions because he’s high out of his mind and I have tears in my eyes because it’s hard to see someone you care about like that. 
That was 4 nights ago and I haven’t seen him since.
He ended up ghosting me all day the next day again and part into the day after when he finally responded to me and sent me a message saying he thought he needed some space to figure some things out about himself before diving into this relationship full force. I take this time to mention again, I don’t know if I can be with someone who is doing the drug as much as it seems like he is and I would like to talk about it more. He doesn’t acknowledge that text and I end up leaving him alone so he can have some space and tell him when he would like to reach out I am here to talk.

He ends up texting me today and we talk a little. I mention that I am going to on his side of town again this week watching over my moms house because she is going camping for the weekend. I make sure to mention that in a way that isn’t like I want to party again but like I would like to meet up to talk since we will be down the street from eachother. He says that he thinks he can do that and he will keep me updated. So as of now, my mom leaves Thursday and I’m hoping to see him Thursday or Friday before she comes back.

I know this was all really long but I feel like it’s necessary to explain where I am coming from and how this all happened. I’ve been using this past week to reflect on a lot of things. Thinking a lot about the first time we “dated” and how maybe his odd behavior was because he was high then? I remember one incidence where he was just rummaging around non stop in his kitchen and wouldn’t take a second to even talk to me. He seemed all over the place and I thought maybe he was off his meds or something. Flash forward to now and that look in his eyes is similar to the one I saw the other day when he kissed me goodbye. 

I feel really stupid. Like I just thought someone could use meth on and off like that? I mean can you do that? I also dont think I expected to see him again after that initial night, but now that feelings have developed it’s obviously an issue. He’s told me he is falling in love with me and I believe those feelings are real, by how he’s been around me, but he’s also said he has things about he himself that he thinks will ruin this and I think maybe that’s what he’s talking about but we haven’t been able to have a real discussion about it. He mentioned the other night when we were in bed talking that it is something he is embarrassed of and that he doesn’t want his friends to know he does. So this makes me wonder if it’s why he kept it so secretive also. In reference to his ex girlfriend he often says “she had to put up with a lot.”
And this makes my mind go there as well.

I obviously know I need to talk to him about it. I haven’t had a chance to because he went so distant he won’t talk to me on the phone even. That’s why I’m hoping to see him in person this week and finally get down to it. I’m obviously not talking to everyone about this but I have brought it up with a few close friends. My one friend is telling me there’s no way he can just “do it here and there” and that meth “doesn’t work that way.” He’s said that he would not be able to just quit it and that rehab is the only way. I don’t know why I thought it was like something you could kick on your own. I guess I’m just super confused and I feel really stupid that I’m even in this situation.

The other weird thing to me is that he doesn’t stay up for days on end. He sleeps early and gets up early. He has a pretty normal schedule. How is someone who’s on meth all the time able to sleep? I’ve also read about how people with ADD experience meth differently. I think that he thinks it obviously helps him function and that’s why he uses it, I don’t believe he gets that euphoric high feeling most talk about. I’m not trying to downplay this by any means, just from how I think he’s thinking of his usage.

I guess my question is, is it possible to just stop? He expressed he wants to, says he doesn’t use it all the time (but now I’m questioning that) and that he’s always done it like this. (Just uses it occasionally to party and then goes periods of time without it). Am I that stupid that I would even believe that? When all is said and done, I don’t think he is a bad person. I do think he is ashamed of his using and I do think he really has feelings for me but also is struggling to date me in spite of this because he’s now found out I am not okay with it. 

What do I do? Has anyone else been in a situation like mine? 

I really appreciate anyone who read all of that. I needed to get this out of me. Please be kind, I know it’s easy to call me an idiot. I’ve been doing that enough myself lately. I just really care for this person and want to help them, even if it is just as my friend and not my boyfriend. He doesn’t have much and I don’t think he’s a monster.

They scare me, make me physically uncomfortable, and manic, but I seem to do them every Saturday. I have bad trips each time and become extremely uncomfortable in my own skin, but I can’t stop doing it. Every time I’m tripping, I think “I can’t wait until this is over, I hate this and just want be sober. This is hell.” But the following day I’m craving to be fucked up again thinking about how fun it was and excited for the following week.

I have been taking Bupron 150mg XL (Bupropion Hydrochloride) for the past 2 years for depression and emotional blunting caused due to Desvenlafaxine.

I have been on and off Alprazolam, Etizolam, Clonazepam etc. for anxiety, but I want a long term fix.

Bupropion helps me enjoy world, find pleasure in music and generally makes me feel ""human"".  
However, it causes me immense emotional pain and suffering as well. I have become extremely sensitive towards social rejection and it causes me extreme anxiety (crushing chest pain that I had to get an ECG twice!)  
Also, I have racing thoughts (mostly music playing in my head in the night) on it.  
I want something in addition which can help me with this jittery, restlessness and chest pain inducing anxiety.  
I have tried coming off Bupron, but the withdrawals make me sad, extremely tired and mentally slow!  
Please suggest something that can suit me to fix the anxiety caused by this.

I take Bacopa (500mg), Ashwagandha (500mg) every night and apart from keeping my digestion good, they don't seem to do anything.  
I have tried L-Theanine as well (200mg), doesn't do much. For emergency relief, I take etizolam 0.25mg or alprazolam 0.25mg.  
But I need some safer alternative.  
My psychiatrist prescribed me olanzapine 2.5 mg for these, but it's just giving me hand tremors and sedation. Also, I don't want to take antipsychotics.

Any other thing, which has helped anyone of you?  
Would be really thankful as this is making my life hell! Everyday I have to tolerate immense anxiety because of Bupropion! I can't stop it and have trouble taking it everyday!

PS: I'm sensitive to stimulants (since I take Bupropion), so I don't take caffeine etc.  
Also, I'm someone who get side effects easily.

I live in constant fear of something happening to those I love and I have to know there exists an 'off' switch for that kind of pain. I've never lost anyone close and I have no intentions of dealing with that bullshit. I was considering meth since it makes me super happy and able to live in the present. But under such circumstances, I feel like the anxiety would be too overwhelming. So I think the perfect combo would be:

\- benzos (pre-stim)

\- meth or coke

\- booze and cigs non-stop whilst snorting/smoking stims 

\- more benzos for comedown once euphoria wears off

\- Zopiclone to knock me unconcious 

\- Wake up, repeat forever

Basically my plan is to fry my brain so that I'm either completely gone or just dead. I've never taken  many opioids cause I always found them to be pretty meh. But I've only ever eaten light doses, so if anyone has experience in that realm please let me know if it would give me what I'm looking for. I'm particularly interested in the heroin/meth speedball combo.

Bonus points if anyone has suggestions that will let me see or talk to my dead relatives in a non-scary way.

Two hours pass and I decide to take another cap of some other stuff that everyone at the party was on. 5 hours into the party and 2 hours after I’ve taken my second cap I was extremely bummed and unsociable. The whole experience was slight placebo moments where I think to myself am I feeling it? And then nothing. I’m not experienced with drugs only weed and alcohol so I think I would’ve noticed. Later in the night I said fuck it might as well have a drink so I drank as much as I could in a ten minute period and eventually got fucked up. At this point I start to think I’m feeling the effects but it could’ve just been the alcohol because it was a long time since taking the caps. I did gurn a little bit when drunk but in all honesty I think it was just placebo and me expecting too much. Will it hit next time I try? Do I still need to wait 3 months even though I didn’t experience a high or a comedown? Is it a bad idea to mix alcohol and caps to feel the high?

I'm 21 years old. I have bipolar disorder and accompanied by this are super protective controlling dramatic parents.

They've had me down as an alcoholic before just because I'd down the odd bottle of vodka (and was made to feel terrible for it).

I recognise that I'm spending too much on drugs, but realistically all I'd say is that I'm overindulging and experimenting as I'd barely touched anything before this year. I'm sitting around doing very little thanks to the ups and downs of bipolar and am constantly bored. My flat is a mess admittedly (but always was and is fairly normal to be after a bender) and I'm a tiny bit behind on bills (was in just as much of a financial wreck before drugs - that's the nature of bipolar).

Objectively, I haven't even had that many drugs this month. Since being paid on the 12th, I've had (darkweb):

260mg OxyContin sniffed

3.5g ketamine sniffed

1g crack cocaine smoked (with bumps of ket mainly)

1 250mcg LSD tab (first time trying, actually)

56g kratom (which can be like 6-10g per serving and is very soft on the body)

0.25g heroin smoked (a very rare treat, wouldn't particularly jump up and down about it tbh)

30 odd 2mg Xanax bars

It is a fair amount, but hardly ""junkie"" level?

To me, I'm probably just a bit over excited by the freedom of moving out and enjoy drugs mire often than I should and it will calm down. Don't feel addicted or dependent and it isn't causing any major NEW issues.

My mum constantly harasses me on the phone when I don't answer her calls, sends texts saying ""I know what you're doing"" and then said ""but I thought you were dead"". They've turned it into an ""us or the drugs"" issue even though I haven't caused them any major issues with it other than them freaking and trying to interfere as usual. If you ask me they just hate not being able to control every aspect of my life.

It's honestly hard to tell with parents who are so crazy and jump up and down over everything (was once shouted at and made to feel bad for getting drunk with friends at 19, for instance). People do tend to react dramatically to the word ""drugs"", so it's hard to see objectively. I know it's a bit beyond 'normal' drug use, but to call me a ""junkie"" is total overkill if you ask me (although that's worrying as most junkies do say that lol). Almost feels insulting to those suffering genuine drug addiction.

I could stop if I wanted to but I don't want to as I enjoy getting high every now and then. I feel as if my family are more of an issue than the drugs.

Why do I never see anyone talking about the law side of psychedelics? If you're smart, you can avoid getting busted. Police are not omniscient. They need tangible evidence to do anything. tattletales or ""tips"" are not enough for them to search your house. If they investigate, it's going to be hard to get enough evidence for a search warrant if you just possess and don't sell.

1: Always keep the drugs inside your house. Do not take them outside the house for any reason. Don't take them out in a forest, don't take them in a park, don't smoke on the outside porch, don't keep them in your car. In the house only.

2: Don't dispose of anything drug-related in the municipal garbage. If police investigate you, one trick they often do is a trash pull, where they dig through your trash bags and look for drug paraphernalia. If you must dispose of something, find a random dumpster somewhere, or better, find a way to destroy it.

3: Don't take pictures or post pictures. Talking about the drugs is okay, because speech alone is not good evidence. but that's the hard limit. No more than just talking.

4: Don't sell or distribute. Don't show or share the drugs with anyone, not even friends.

5: If you live in an apartment complex, don't smoke weed. Edibles are safer.

6: Personal amounts only. Don't keep more than you can swallow if you hear the dreaded 3 hard knocks and ""POLICE SEARCH WARRANT!""

7: Obviously, keep the windows closed when smoking anything.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,690563,public,confidence,self,How to avoid getting arrested for having psychedelics and having your life ruined.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hj5one/how_to_avoid_getting_arrested_for_having/,no_ads,0.0,1593617413.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So fast forward to about 2 months ago and I j got a few bars off this guy I knew from school. I get home crush em up and wait til night when my parents are asleep. I had been a really heavy weed smoker for awhile (quit 4 days ago) so I decide to rip my cart a few times. It got me a lot higher than I expected it too because I forgot it was a new strain. So I vibe to some music and wait til about 10:00 that night to take them. Not really sure how much I took but I’m pretty sure it was a lot. Next thing I know it’s morning and I’ve been asleep for awhile. I feel somethings off but not really sure what. I feel really sick and then I realize that I’m hungover. I check where my vodka was and the bottle was empty. So apparently I also got really drunk and didn’t remember it. But thens here when things get really fucked up. My head feels really cold. Not really sure why so I got to the bathroom and I have no fucking hair on my head. Like 0 like I’m bald. My hair was pretty damn long at the time so this doesn’t really make sense so me.I low key start freaking out but then I see the scissors and razor and it starts coming back to me. Apparently after I took the xans at some point in the night I got extremely ducking drunk and went to the bathroom and cut all my hair off. It’s July 1st now and I got most of my hair back but still not near as much as I used to have.

This week on Monday I decided to quit nicotine cold turkey out of a 11 month old vaping addiction of 50mg nic salt I; would go through a 2mL pod every other day. 

I’m (19m) and work retail I like my job. I vaped because I was stressed from school and just wanted an easy escape. I smoked weed sometimes but I need to be in the right mind set to do it so I don’t freak out. With nic it didn’t matter where I was. First thing I did, get that morning buzz (it was the only time I felt anything all day). Took a shower vaped, vaped on the way to work, in the bathroom at work, outside at work. On the way home, at my desk at home, while I did school work. Friends over, drinking. Just to name a few. 

Today I had to do a makeup quiz online because my professor suspected me of cheating (which I did.) so I just told her I cheated and was going through withdrawals the past 2 days. I got super emotional and after talking to her over zoom. I got the balls to tell my mom about what I have done. I love my parents to death, and they are in every word so perfect to have in my life. My mom wasn’t too educated on what it was but was glad I was quitting. And my dad said that I should of told them sooner, but I was making the smart choice. 

What irritates me is that I was hiding this problem from them for the past 11 months and never got caught by them (wouldn’t even care if I did) so I put myself in weird  scenarios where I would excuse myself to vape. I feel like shit right now, I’m super stressed out anxious and want to drop out of my class for school. Just wanted to vent and now I’m going to listen to some music before I get some good sleep. Sorry if this is badly typed up. 

It’s time to be done with this shit, I’m 45 hours in from my last puff. I’m beating this for good.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,690519,public,confidence,self,Hardest Day in a while.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hj2epi/hardest_day_in_a_while/,no_ads,0.0,1593602494.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am taking them as I study for my exams in school.  I take them almost every day.  Recently because of COVID, I've been staying at home.  So I don't really have a set bedtime or wake up time.

I can pretty much wake up whenever I want, which leads to a terrible cycle.  If I wake up late, say at around 12:00 PM or 1:00 PM, I'll take my Vyvanse late.  Then I'll take my Adderall booster even later and stay up until like 6-8 AM.  Then I finally fall asleep and the cycle continues.  It's gotten so bad that I sometimes sleep from like 9 AM to 4 PM.

And every time I try to break it, one small thing like sleeping in will set me back off again.  I've tried staying up for 36 hours to reset like 5 times.  I've also taken diphenhydramine at night, but it just makes me even more tired the next day without doing anything to reset my body clock.

Is there anything I can do to be on a normal schedule while still regularly taking amphetamines.  I'm living with my family and am tired of having to only eat only protein bars because I can't make noise at night to cook.  I'm also not as productive because I'm always focused on trying to sleep.  And I constantly feel tired.  I generally pull an all nighter at least once a week.

But yesterday posed a new challenge, snow and fog. I had just hit a pen, this visuals were pretty cool, and I just wanted to hike up to the top of the hill to get a clear view of the mountain. Everything was covered in snow, and being from Texas, I didn’t realize how fucking disorienting snow and trees can be. Once I got to the spot I wanted to get to, I started to descend down the hill, except I apparently went down the wrong side. Well fuck, I mean logically where I started from can’t be that far away right? n o p e, as the snow glistened in a disco array of colors I saw these ominous clouds overtaking the mountain, and moving towards me. I start frantically running to where I put a location marker on my phone of the spot I started at, but I had fallen multiple times and while trying to scale some hills strained some muscles in my legs and now they felt like jelly. Now the fog is covering everything. I have lost my water. I start eating the snow for hydration as I continue to wonder around. At this point I’m just looking for a fucking signal, and then realized the higher up the mountain I go the better chance I have at getting a signal. High as fuck, I’m now stumbling up giant hills and subsequently falling down and just having a miserable time. I reach a non snow covered tree patch, am terrified of whatever the fuck animals sounds I am hearing, and am beginning to accept my plane amongst the nature. Anprim gang? I hear people calling out, but decide not to wonder towards the voices as I don’t trust that I can actually locate where they’re coming from or if they’re actually even real and delirium is just setting in. Finally, I reach a spot where there is reception. I call 911, get a text from the ranger station, and send them a geocoordinate of my location. The reception then disappears but I figured they got my location so I just stayed put. For some reason I never thought I was actually gonna die, for whatever reason, perhaps the acid, I had this illogical self confidence that there was no possible way I would die. Well I ended up being right as the rangers eventually showed up and escorted me back. I am shocked I had the mind control to not fall into absolute existential horror in that situation, ig mindfulness and mediation actually do work.

Our friendship is complicated to say the least. We have 11 years of history. But in the last year my friend has sort of spiraled and I don’t wanna sound like a prude but it’s like watching one of those documentaries on why drugs are bad. 

It started with just some party drugs here and there. And im down for all of that. Ive done molly and shrooms and a bunch of other things many many times. But i think the difference is that i know when it starts to affect my life negatively, i stop. When i build a tolerance to things, i stop. But it seems like she can’t or won’t. 

She quickly graduated up the scale of drugs in just a couple months. She used to be the type of person to hang up the phone and tell me to take a nap when i smoked too much weed. This was the same person that told me she thought i had a serious alcohol problem when i asked her to buy me a pint of rum because I didn’t have my id at the time. And in a matter of months she went from doing jigs to doing molly to doing meth, and now meth is her go to. Sometimes staying up binging multiple days at a time. She lost two jobs for different reasons and now she just sort of buys and sells drugs out of her car. All of her things are at her mothers house and she choses not to be there because her mother lives a 30-40 min drive away, and she can make money here. 

Ive had several discussions with her about it, even threatened our friendship if she didn’t quit. It was stupid and i felt like the asshole then and now while typing it. But she was seemingly clean for 2 months. Until she revealed that she had been lying about being clean. 

I’ve been kind of distant because i know she doesn’t want me to worry about her, and ive done meth a couple times when i was extremely low. So I definitely don’t judge her for her choices. I guess i just wish it was more casual instead of how regular it is. I wish i knew how to be a supportive friend when i believe so strongly that meth and heroin are just the kind of drugs you rarely want to touch. Even when i did it those couple times I didn’t like how it felt, especially when I couldn’t go to sleep after. 

She’s lately been asking me to sleep over or use my shower. And I’ve done both for her but now my bf is tired of her always being here and says im enabling her. Idk that i am because I don’t generally give her money, but he says i am because im providing her a safe place she would otherwise have to search for without me. Im at my wits end because ive just been ignoring her the last couple days and making excuses why I can’t hang out.

Even though I don’t have ADHD, I take Wellbutrin 150mg XL, which I know is a stimulant commonly prescribed to ADHD patients, for depression. It’s worked really well for me as an antidepressant and it makes me a lot more motivated, however I’ve never felt “high” or “euphoric”on it. On the other hand my friend who unlike me has been diagnosed with ADHD takes Concerta 20mg every day and claims he experiences a strong feeling of pleasure on it to the point he can’t even eat. The first week on Wellbutrin I did feel a bit agitated and had some nausea that did lead to me decreasing my food intake, but even then I didn’t feel anything that resembled a recreational-type high. Now according to a lot of articles Wellbutrin is actually a stronger stimulant and hence more likely to produce a coke-like buzz than Concerta. I keep thinking there has to be something wrong with me as a person who legitimately has ADHD feels less “normal” on cahinones than me. I keep thinking that I may have undiagnosed ADHD myself, but I’ve never really had any trouble focusing that I can remember. I was quite hard-working and had perfect grades (shit it seems like I’m bragging but really what does someone’s performance in middle school matter?) until about 11th grade, when I became a heavy weed smoker and underwent a breakup that left me devastated and depleted of motivation, which I know is a symptom of ADHD, but still it seems to be a bit of a circumstantial thing, and even then I still managed to do very well in school as despite how much I procrastinated in the end my anxiety always forced me to last-minute study.

Throwaway account because drug talk in a world of misunderstanding. 

This all happened some time ago &amp; it's been on my mind.

Not even going to go too into it, but a friend and I were looking through their parent's freezer and we found a crumpled bag at the bottom of it. Being the nosy fuckers we are, we opened it and found a large bag of shrooms (which are legal here) and another powdery-substance in a bag. We believe it was meth. We never touched it, obviously, because fuck unknown substances. It was a white powder, sort of crystall-y, which is a definite indicator of meth, we think. It had been in there for a while. But the weird part that I'm wondering about is there were little squishy cubes. Not very many, the bag was about the size of a dimebag of white powder and little squishy green cubes. 

Occasionally, my friend asks me what I think the substance was. I have no idea. I want to believe it was meth or coke or something similar but I am not very educated in that area. I think they believe their parents are metheads or something. I want to clear the air with them. We both have such an unresolved feeling about this &amp; so I am reaching out for help.

Cocaine prior to that for about 5 years. 

I have convinced her to go to rehab twice (as has her family). Both time she has gotten out of rehab in my care, she has been uncontrollably delusional. Constantly talking about how the FBI is using her friends voices to communicate to her telepathically, etc. this behavior does not go away. She does not respond well to anti-psychotic medicines when she is clean, either. She cannot take them or refuses to take them regularly, and often sleeps for 24-48 hours while on them. She has trouble spelling, speaking, doing normal everyday tasks like driving, fumbles with objects (I.e. instead of changing the channel on the remote, will pick it up and not know what to do with the remote), and reading her diaries - is fully paranoid schizophrenic. 

Her quality of life absolutely, truly plummets when she is clean. This is coming from a former (9 year clean) addict. 

She is truly out of her mind no matter if she is clean for 3 days or 6 months. If she is using, she speaks eloquently, intelligently, charmingly. She is able to do live a nearly normal life except for her work - in which she panhandles and sells her body (though not as much as you might think). 

My question is; as horrible as it sounds, is there any use to her getting clean? Looking at it from a selfless point of view - this drug, which is all she has known for 10 years, is the only thing that keeps her somewhat sane. Is it unreasonable to say she’s better off using?

Essentially, the post contains a link to a study about quercetin and morphine tolerance.  That paper is the first of two relevant papers linked below.  

[Possible mechanisms of action in quercetin reversal of morphine tolerance and dependence](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13556210310001602248?casa_token=nDynpFXNGRgAAAAA:a6Q6qZd8AZEEK67s2lKWAB5qtcYGECW-43phc7gmWYxewiEHb9-uW2j265sUYDhXk7PB1BTxn6eHxg)

Now, there are, to my knowledge, no human reports of quercetin used in an attempt to attenuate opioid tolerance.  There certainly aren't studies.  So far, we've only established this in mice. 

Now, I kinda doubted it would work in humans--pessimism.  Nothing shocking like that ever happens. But the study results are...kinda amazing...and quercetin is already a fairly widely used supplement.

I looked over the internet to see if anyone had bioassayed it in this context.  Nope.  I figured it was a very safe chemical, so I might as well buy a bottle and use it for a week or two.  

**I want to note that I was not expecting a success when I took the quercetin, so I did not document my results.  I wish I could go back and do so.  Unfortunately, you will have to make do with some slight hand-waving about exactly how much kratom I took when.**  

**It is possible--but I find it to have maybe a 1/10 chance--that it was placebo.  I would like to see a controlled study done in a clinical setting--which is why I am putting this out there.** 

I would also like to state that the results seemed stronger than would be likely for a placebo.

I took 4000mg per diem, split into two doses.

&gt;It is now two weeks later.  At the start, I took 8 to 10 gram doses of kratom (from a reputable vendor, and works on my fiance at much lower doses) to feel some mild sedation--with redosing--for 30+g per day.    
&gt;  
&gt;A few days in, I noticed that my usual doses caused severe nausea, so I cut down to 6 gram doses, taking maybe 18-20g per day.  I had to take zofran (ondansetron, a strong antiemetic) a few times.  These episodes of nausea presented with extremely heavy sedation, like I used to get from a 5 gram dose back in 2016.  
&gt;  
&gt;Currently, I am taking 4 gram doses and feeling euphoria.  I have reduced my daily intake to perhaps 12 grams, if that--maybe closer to 8.  

I made those reductions in usage because my prior doses were knocking me out and causing nausea.  I do not plan to take enough to nod--I'm now using the quercetin to help me quit--but I suspect 5 grams would be enough.  When I started taking quercetin, I would, again, need to take twice tha to feel anything. 

I also want to state that I did not switch batches of kratom during the above time period--so it's not like I had crap kratom and suddenly acquired decent stuff. 

**My tolerance dropped seemingly on its own, while I continued use, still getting high.**  

This could be a lifesaver for a lot of hard opioid users.  This could improve the lives of opioid-dependent cancer patients or chronic pain patients.  

I want to say, though, that anyone who plans to experiment with it ought to be very careful.  Having a significant tolerance reduction between days of kratom use will not kill.  Katom barely touches respiratory function compared to things like fentanyl and heroin.  With these, it may be possible to actually overdose on a dose that was safe the prior night.  

For pain management in those not addicted to opioids, it would make sense to prescribe this alongside the opioid--hopefully keeping baseline tolerance.

I browse here alot on my main account, but I'm posting this on a throwaway for the sake of my own privacy.

One of my close loved ones has been doing drugs since he was about 13, and drank for years. It progressed to an issue of drinking roughly 9-13 drinks a night. He still smokes weed but that's not really too much of an issue as of right now but he desires to stop eventually. (he doesn't like the feeling of needing drugs I suppose)

Well in the last year or so his view on alcohol abruptly changed, as he claims it just doesn't affect him the same way anymore. On one hand he knows that's good, but on another hand it hurts his feelings and it's hard for him to cope with in a way after drinking for years.

As we begin to do less and less drugs, he's having a lot of trouble finding things he enjoys doing anymore. He says that things aren't interesting anymore, and that it's hard to have fun without drugs being in the picture, but he does want to stop.

Recovering/recovered addicts: what helped you cope with a life with less drugs? It worries me (also a teenager) that he is having these issues as I have helped guide him through, in a sense, the path of leaving daily drug usage behind.

Not sure just how well received this question will be in this sub but it's worth a shot. 

I've been researching therapeutic ketamine immensely over the last month and I'm greatly considering it, even though the cost is super prohibitive I'm still calculating if it's worth it. That said I've been growing my own psilocybe cubensis (shrooms) for essentially the same reason as ketamine treatment: depression alleviation. Microdosing cubensis seems to work pretty well for a good 24-48 hours, but then I return to instability. I haven't had a real trip yet other than a couple unremarkable 1g experiences.  I'm still afraid as I'm still on 25mg of Zoloft and the SSRI/Mushroom interaction I'm convinced just knowing about serotonin syndrome I would probably have a bad trip. That said that's why ketamine is such a viable option as it's glutamate based and not serotonin based, no real contraindications. 

I'm curious if anyone has transitioned from ketamine to using psilocybin trips therapeutically, or if anyone is able to compare the two in terms of effectiveness against depression.

Backstory: Moderate depression, went on SSRI and Klonopin, SSRI probably stopped working that first year but stayed on, klonopin kept working. 2nd year put on a stimulant, worked pretty well. 3rd year had recurring depressive symptoms despite being on high dose SSRI and stims; cognitive issues, memory issues, emotional numbness. Had a rapid klonopin and stim withdrawal that fucked me up for 6 months, threw me into an even deeper well of depression. Things still haven't gotten much better despite approaching 2 years since the benzo withdrawal. Started tapering the SSRI slowly from highest dose to lowest dose over the last year, now on lowest dose but afraid to get off entirely despite knowing it's what I have to do to get out of this cycle of depression (convinced the meds are just making things worse long term, at the very least certainly are not helping one bit)",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,690448,public,confidence,self,"Mushrooms vs Ketamine, any similarity/difference in therapeutic effectiveness?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hixw13/mushrooms_vs_ketamine_any_similaritydifference_in/,no_ads,0.0,1593585205.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've done LSD, DMT and shrooms many times. 
I acquired some dispensary edibles off the street and everything seemed fine, the package was sealed with no noticeable damages. I was confident taking  150mg, (one and a half gummies) because a few days prior I had consumed 250 mg of the exact same brand and type of edible with no issue. 
15-20 minutes after consumption I began to feel kind of loopy and out of it, almost like a Xanax. I thought it was odd that they were kicking in so fast, and that the high was more disorienting. Fast forward some time later and I'm having full blown visual and auditory hallucinations, it feels like nails are being drilled into the front and back of my head (something I've only felt on hallucinogenics) and my behavior had become erratic. 
I've experienced anxiety, paranoia and hallucinogenic effects from marijuana in the past but this was nothing like it. I was screaming and crying uncontrollably and i was being aggressive with my dad for no reason. My hallucinations were similar to what I saw while tripping on DMT, a bunch of colors and patterns even when my eyes were closed. There was a persistent ""ringing"" in my ears that sounded like a siren at times. There was one point when the visuals became so strong that I was no longer seeing what was actually in front of me. 
Has anyone else experienced a high like this from edibles? Is there a possibility they were laced with PCP or something of that nature? Both times I purchased from the same guy.

It is my first time posting here, and I will get straight to the point. 

I have sporadically used amphetamines and benzodiazepines for the last year, amphetamines most of the time, and rarely benzodiazepines to put me to sleep, but never for more than 1 week in a row. However, after my last binge I had the worst high ever, it felt like dying and took 4mg etizolam to knock me out, which worked, but with sever side effects next day and since then I did not touch them again. 

I have developed a problem when I fall asleep and I do not know what it is or if I need help. Every time I fell asleep I suddenly feel like my whole body is vibrating and is lifting up and feel like something is touching with his nails, pushing them, trying to hurt me(I know, sounds crazy) , then when I manage to relax and open my eyes, everything is blurry and I am very tired and feel heavy.

Anyways yesterday I was laying on my couch with three balloons ready (warming up) two had two nangs each and the other had one.

I had some Beethoven playing (great for all drugs) I inhaled some air then took the whole 1 Nang balloon down and held it for 10-15 seconds exhaled and I was already escaping into the beauty of nitrous.

Then things got intense I breathed a bit then took in a large amount of the second balloon and held that in for  15-20 seconds and exhaled.

The best way to describe it would be, my vision was like a mirrored hallucination of reality. Then I closed my eyes and let this beautiful warm euphoria take hold as it felt like I was lost in space. And I heard lazers constantly (often described as womp womp womp by the nitrous community).

I then took in the last balloon and relived that. 

It was my favorite drug experience I've had so far, I'll do it again on the next 29th and supplement B12 next week.

This time in total I did 20 cannisters, next time I'll likely do 50 knowing what I know now.

At this point I don't care much for weed anymore as it was that much better. And alcohol I've never cared for much.

I don’t drink outside of those nights.


For a long time I haven’t been enjoying nights out, as I haven’t particularly enjoyed the feeling of being drunk, barely noticing a difference in my confidence, risk-taking, extroversion, and all the commonly associated “benefits” of alcohol. 


So, on Saturday I decided to take a cap of mdma with my friends for the first time. I would say normally I am not a very extroverted or generally empathetic person (unless I’m relating to the characters in books or media) but that night I spent the entire time happy, thoughtful, empathetic, extroverted. I made plans about my future, cared about the people I talked to, coherently engaged in discussions with people who I assumed had something meaningful to say. 


I would say normally I am a frequently unhappy person. I am constantly battling internal, opposite thoughts and engaging with myself in internal arguments. It’s not all bad. I have a good life, and I’m not as unhappy as some, just probably more unhappy than some others. 


I had no come-down from the cap. Since I took it four nights ago, I have not had any contradicting, argumentative thoughts. I have not been unhappy even once. I have felt clear in my convictions and decisions, and have had no serious doubts about my future. 


What on earth has happened? 


More importantly, when should I take one single cap again? I watched my friends take two each, and they were spacey, chewing their jaws, and just didn’t seem as coherent as I was. I think I will only take one again next time, because I’m more interested in the happiness, extroversion, and empathy than whatever happened to them.

Idk ...

Anyway ... 

So at the weekend I binged a lot of  coke (around 2 grams) and some mdma (around half a gram) and it’s now three days later and I’m unnaturally exhausted. I’ve been eating well &amp; eating a lot of fruits/veg + drinking smoothies etc to try and get more nutrition and vitamins or whateva, but I still am soooo exhausted and really extremely disassociated which is kinda scary sometimes

I’ve taken both drugs before but this is more than I’ve taken in a while. I also was awake for around 27 hours as I couldn’t sleep due to anxiety and paranoia of dying, when I finally did sleep, I woke up and smoked a few joints, freaked the fuck out and became overwhelmingly paranoid 🥴 currently, I’m taking a break from ALL substances, including alcohol, but I was just wondering if anyone has had similar experiences? The constant exhaustion is the most annoying as I’m super busy and don’t have time to be so lethargic !

Ranking should take into account both positives and negatives of the drug.
For example:
(1) mephedrone (4mmc), got this as my first as I've only had a few experiences with it as a stimulant and not really experienced any negatives other than a standard comedown and some strong urges to redose. Positives being an mdma/coke like euphoria which keeps on giving after every line, stuff felt incredible. 

(2) cocaine, only negative for me being the price and strong urge to redose. Comedowns on this drug for me personally are very manageable and nothing compared to other stimulants. Euphoria wise pure cocaine is amazing it just puts me in this perfect headspace for socialising, dancing and just living in the moment. Definetly one of my favourite drugs for nights out with friends and pairs so synergistically with alcohol. 

(3) Mdma, negatives being a rough comedown, diminishing returns upon redoses and having to space usage out by at least several weeks to avoid bad neurotoxicity. Positives being amazing euphoria which just makes you feel incredible in the moment, makes music sound amazing and makes you feel so emotionally connected to everyone. Had some of the best ""deep chats"" with close friends on mdma which I'll never forget. 

(4) amphetamine sulfate, negatives being a rough comedown and slightly anxiety inducing in higher dosages. Urge to redose isn't really there with this chem as long as I stick to oral which is my go to dose. Gives me a nice euphoria and sociability, however I mainly use this for long study sessions rather than for partying. 

(5) vyvanse, negatives being it didn't provide any sort of euphoria just made me feel very wired and jittery as if I'd taken a very large dose of caffeine. Also the duration was extremely long however this might have been my dose of 70mg. No positives with this chem other than making me extremely focused. 

As you can see ive not really tried alot of stimulants however I've had many experiences with mdma and cocaine. Interested on trying some others but would love to hear about people's personal experiences firsthand. On my to do list is methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate, 4f-mph, 3fpm and propylhexedrine.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,690374,public,confidence,self,What's the best stimulant you've done ranked,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hip5xn/whats_the_best_stimulant_youve_done_ranked/,no_ads,0.0,1593558663.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will do 100mg mdma, i will use Alka-Seltzer prior to taking mdma. I will take ALA, MG, vitC pre during post mdma, won't dance etc etc

I plan to take nac during the comedown. Is it a good idea?

I heard that talking nac before alcohol consumption protects liver, but if you take nac after alcohol it worsens the liver than not taking nac at all.

So let's say i wanted to stop the mdma high, would nac (1g) stop the high? Or is it wise to take?

As it's such an extremely potent stimulant my idea was to take what I thought would be really low dose like once in the morning for maybe a few weeks? I finally bought some from the dark web and because I didn't have a very accurate scale I think I may have taken a bit too much in the first two days. I was shooting for something like 10mg but I think on day one I took something like 50 and today I took maybe 25-30 now I genuinely feel like garbage in the sense that this is a very strong stimulant high (with irregular heartbeat and jitters and all) and it's not what I was going for. I've ordered a more accurate scale online and after perhaps taking a few days off I'll try to actually do 10mgs (I perhaps ordered too much 3.5g because I had no idea how potent this was)

So a few weeks ago I did something stupid and went on a 3/4 days 2-fma binge. I also barley slept in those days. I did it in an attempt to finish some exams.

So during the fourth day I decided I needed to go to sleep, I smoked some weed to some weed and tried to go to sleep. About 10-15 minutes after smoking my body started to swell up and it was hard to breath for a while. This reaction went down and it came and went in the following days but it eventually stopped.

Now 2 weeks ago after a time of catching up on sleeping, eating enough and just generally resting I smoked some weed, I did not get the same reaction I did that night but I did feel like I was a little bit more swollen than I would usally be (granted this could have been me just not feeling okay in my body overal cause due to stress I didn't really exercise for like two weeks and it might have just been me being used to myself being more in shape)

But overal I would just like to hear what some other people think that happened that day, I feel like a lot of the symptoms I got the second time smoking after that night were mostly anxiety induced by me being slightly traumatized from what happened.

(I've been to my gp, and she didn't see anything that was wrong with me also didn't have fluid retention according to her)

The PsyCOVIDelic Survey is a short anonymous online survey with which we aim to understand **the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychedelic experiences**.

Currently, we are most interested in experiences that took place **at the beginning of the pandemic**, but we appreciate any experiences that you would like to share with us.

To take part, you must be **at least 18 years of age and have taken a psychedelic drug (not microdosing) during the COVID-19 pandemic**. The survey begins with questions related to your state of mind and environmental factors present before and during your psychedelic experience. Then, you will have the opportunity to describe your experience in your own words. Additionally, we will ask you about certain aspects of the experience, and finally, there will be some demographic questions. The survey can be completed in **30 minutes** and might hopefully provide an opportunity to reflect on and integrate your experience.

The Netherlands is under international fire for drug trafficking by mail

The trade in hard drugs by mail is growing and gives the Netherlands an increasingly poor image internationally. Every month, Dutch dealers send an estimated 9,000 postal parcels containing coke, ecstasy, speed or crystal meth abroad. This is what police and justice say to NRC.

The drugs from the Netherlands cause resentment among police officers, prosecutors, customs and foreign government agencies in countries such as Germany, France, Austria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the United States, Australia and many Asian countries. Foreign colleagues report to Dutch investigating officers that they are ""inundated"" with drug packages from the Netherlands, says prosecutor Neeltje Keeris, who is charged with synthetic drugs at the National Prosecutor's Office. They say, according to Keeris, ""Your mess is reaching our people, we really want it to stop.""

&amp;#x200B;

In Australia, four hundred Dutch drug shipments were seized in a month. Between 2019 and now, the police received 120 requests from abroad to provide information about packages from the Netherlands. They vary in size: from envelopes with a few grams of coke to candy jars filled with 25 kilos of ecstasy pills. Ecstasy and speed in particular are in great demand, but since last year crystal meth is also gaining ground, according to Keeris.

&amp;#x200B;

Reservoir to mail

Australia and the US are so fed up with the drugs from the Netherlands that they take a closer look at Dutch mail. ""Every shipment from the Netherlands is intensively checked,"" says Jelmer Ludwig, team leader of the Post Intervention Team (Pit) of the National Unit, which checks mail for narcotics together with customs and postal companies. The 100 percent check in Australia and the US is creating a “reservoir” of mail, according to Ludwig. Recipients wait longer for their package and the Dutch image as a trading nation is scratching. The officer and the police chief fear that Australia and the US will eventually ban the Netherlands: postal packages will no longer enter the country.

&amp;#x200B;

The drug shipments put pressure on cooperation between police and OM colleagues here and abroad, according to Keeris and Ludwig. ""Wait a minute"", they are regularly told when a request for legal assistance is made abroad. ""Solve the drug problem first."" In a test by Dutch customs, during a few hours of very intensive checks, five hundred packages were picked out, three-quarters of them contained drugs. This translates to more than a hundred thousand drug shipments in a year.

&amp;#x200B;

At postal companies parcels for foreign countries are checked with drug dogs and scanning equipment. If it contains drugs, it will look for points of contact, such as where the package was delivered and by whom - the latter is difficult to find out because the Netherlands has no identification requirement for sending mail abroad.

&amp;#x200B;

New batch of dealers

Police and judiciary are 'deeply concerned' about a new batch of dealers who trade drug packages: young, highly educated men, without a criminal record. In online marketplaces, which are hidden behind special browsers and thus give extra anonymity, they feel safe and send “kilos” of drugs. The men do not realize that they are international drug traffickers. Keeris: ""They think they can get off with a warning or community service."" This is an illusion: a 23-year-old student was sentenced to five years' imprisonment at the end of last year for sending “at least” seventy packages of drugs mainly to Australia.

&amp;#x200B;

The young men sell small quantities at first, but in the long run they will probably be approached by larger dealers from whom they can buy large quantities of drugs at stunt prices. The 23-year-old student and a partner earned at least 2.2 million euros in a year and a half, says Ludwig. The money is spent on a “luxury life”: candy trips to Bali, evening parties, dining out. And some are in bitcoins on a crypto account, making it difficult for the police to confiscate. Keeris: ""There is no bag of money behind the bank.""

&amp;#x200B;

Police and judicial authorities argue for an identification requirement when sending packages abroad. In this way you raise the threshold for sending a large group of drugs. It should also become easier to check shipments for content. Customs and police must now first request permission from a public prosecutor, who must get the green light from the examining magistrate. This causes a delay of at least a week. Police officers themselves must have the authority to open a package, according to Keeris and Ludwig.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay perfect, Did a big line, and the burn wasn't bad unlike the last shit I got right before this. So this is at 4pm didn't feel anything only my heartbeat started so I keep doing lines every hour. I was watching Dope Sick Love, and all those kinda documents so next thing I know it's 3am, and I didn't feel high at all, I looked at the bag I probably did 1.5 grams, and that can last me a week. I made a big line snorted it up, ended up on boyfriendtv and BAM my eyes are fluttering I get this extreme drowsiness can't even get my head up off the pillow and im fighting it, to stand up, next thing I'm nodding out, then I continue to try to sit at least 4 times, in my head this happened for ten minutes now realizing this actually happened for 2 hour period, and the high just went away, not fully something was there, now the sun is coming out, not realizing until later in the day how long I nodded for. I take a nap later in the day when I wake up I've a headache, neck n backaches, chest was hurting, breathing felt weird, felt nauseous, heart is beating which I felt and it was slower. but to me it felt fast like before, but I didn't feel my chest before. So all these symptoms matched the Corinavirus which I knew it was from what I was snorting. I took my temperature four times today 98.7 so before anyone says anything. So I start looking and Fentanyl matches everything I had for withdrawals..... Then hot flashes on and off for a while. It's just so strange. I am no stranger to drugs did many, and normally I never even get a bad comedowns like this after a 3 day binge of Tina, but never anything like this.

Has anyone els had anything similar happen to them?

I don't know 100% it was Fentanyl, but my gut is saying yes, thoughts?

Questions for me?

Now that preface has been stated my question would be this, if someone is forced or is required by their doctor to take 100-200mg tramadol instant release 3-4 times daily never to exceed 700mg from 8am to 1am (the next day) so (17 hour time period with a 7 hour break inbetween the night dose and morning dose) and dosing every 4-6 hours as needed for pain. How would they then reduce seizures. The rule of thumb is no more than 400mg per day of tramadol to avoid seizures however I’m speculating and interested to know how rigid that actually is. Obviously not every person who takes 401mg of tramadol will seize just how people will take 4-5g of tylenol or 2400mg of ibuprofen and not have complications. 

So how rigid is it as well as are there supplements or other tips to raise the seizure threshold. If I were to follow this regimen I understand getting plenty of sleep helps raise seizure threshold as well as staying calm and being aware of pre seizure symptoms and do “abdominal breathing” to reduce the chance of seizing.

Lastly my question is what are the short and more importantly long term effects of tramadol induced seizures? There’s a lot of information and studies I found about epileptic seizures however not much at all about tramadol induced seizures since they are acute rather than chronic.

I get the main problem with seizures is falling and hitting my head or dislocating my should etc from the seizing itself and that’s short term but how likely is brain damage? 

And also another side question, from the studies I read about 52% of patients (80 person study) who were administered tramadol had a seizure so what about the 48%? Can they take infinite amounts of tramadol and never seize but instead have respiratory depression?

Can you also get tolerance to the seizure aspect of tramadol? Say you take 100mg tramadol 3 times daily and over the course of 9 months works up to the dosage as described above, does their seizure threshold in response to tramadol raise along with the regular tolerance that anyone else would experience with say hydrocodone?

That’s all, thank you for taking the time out of your day to help answer these or even just give me an idea or studies to look further into.

I have some gold I can give out if you can be magical and answer most or all of my incredibly hard to answer and complex questions.

We drank  like 1.3g  of md in 4 and all of us made 3 months pause, we smoked  we  drank  some beers,  we  were feeling it super good and intense, after 2 3 hours  we went to a friend  who had  some ketamine.  We did  large  ammounts  of ket before but that night , for me , after snorting  a little line of ket  , i felt  something else . I was super close to khole  before but never  in it . After 20 mins  i was  feeling fine , and the next minute when we  reached  to the party  my mind froze  everything  was froze , i heared  the music and saw  the visuals  moving.  I knew that  could  be khole  but i wasnt  sure and was  pretty intense bcz  i was  the only one feeling  it aswell. After some minutes i started  feeling that eveybody  is pushing  me and i was feeling  like i will fall  from time  to time . I was  dissociating like hell  and i started asking  my friends if i say  stupid  things  or if im close to fall  but they said that im good and stop panic.  I was  feeling my legs blocked  to  the ground  like i had  100 kilos  around  my legs.  I couldnt  speak  , when i wanted  to say  something  my neck  was blocked  and i couldnt  speak.  From time  to time  i was  hardly asking  my friends if im ok . But they told  me i was  fine and i think  they thought  im joking  or something, they were  dead aswell but not in my trip.  I met  a lot of friends  and i felt strange  bcz  i wasnt  acting  normal ; i was  feeling  panic  even  if i like these  types  of experiences.  After some time i was  feeling a little  bit better, i spoke  with a friend like 20 mins  and he listened  to all my story.  Then i could walk  again pretty normaly and we went  to the beach to walk a little

just over a week ago something changed in myself, I wasn’t okay just following the same routine of wake and bake and then continually topping up that high.. I wanted more so I decided to stop.
At first it was the same old story when I didn’t have weed (not that it was very often) scraping my grinder, using old end of Joints and even searching to see if I could find that tiny bud I think I dropped weeks before but I really wanted to stop so I tried all the usual things people say to do, more exercise, eat healthier etc.. it didn’t really help.
The first couple of days I was getting really painful headaches, couldn’t concentrate and I was having a hard time controlling my emotions, it was like everything I had suppressed was flooding back and honestly it was a nightmare!  The second thing I noticed in those first days were the sleeplessness and everyday I was waking up at 5am regardless of when I went to sleep. 
So I get up feeling terrible, my brain screaming for a Weed but also with almost a painful hunger like I hadn’t eaten all day, I’m on day 8 now and the hunger and waking at 5am hasn’t gone away but I do feel like now I can use this time and I’m really skinny so having this breakfast routine is kind of beneficial too. 

What you all need to realise is when they say weed makes time fly it’s true, i feel like I’m living in slow motion and these 8 days feel like a month. I live in a house share was 3 guys and they all smoke weed too, every time I smelt it I was get anxious, start sweating, all I could think about was how much I wanted to smoke.. so I had a plan I was going to make a grand gesture and burn my grinder that was from Amsterdam when I first visited over 20 years ago and all my skins etc! Plan in place I woke up and felt confident and slightly better almost past the point of the smell coming from the other housemates rooms, on the night I built the fire and just as I was going to throw it on my heart dropped like Nothing I had felt before BUT I opened my hand and let them fall into the fire and went back into my room. Before I knew what was happening I can’t breath, I’m talking to myself saying ‘it’s fine, it’s done, it’s the first step’ but I just break down and for a few hours im crying as though someone had died, like a part of me had broken! Thinking stuff like what if people don’t like me without weed or what if I don’t like myself. I rang my mum who i told I wanted to quit and she talked me down until I felt calmer. 

The next morning about day 6 I felt so much better although I woke at 5, I just felt more refreshed and happy! I walked out of my room to go get breakfast and smelt the weed someone had smoked night before filling the landing, I was thinking to myself that smells nice BUT I don’t want a joint.. 

that was the first day I really felt I wasn’t teetering on the edge of will I/won’t I.

I felt more motivated, happier in myself like I could see things from a different perspective and I wasn’t making excuses not to go out with friends and family just so I could get high.
Honestly this is the hardest thing I have ever done and although it’s only been 8 days I have past that line of wanting it and now I am thinking about the £2500-3000 a year I will be saving and what other great things I could do with that. 

I hope everyone realises during this I AM NOT BLAMING WEED for my problems. 
Basically I was depending on weed, I used to say it’s the only thing that levels me out and makes me feel normal despite being a cunt(sorry) to my friends and family occasionally!  I don’t feel like I need it anymore and yes I had some great times smoking but equally I feel like it was holding me back and trapping me in a cycle which I thought I would never escape.

I hope some people benefit from this if they want to move forward and feel free to share it with anyone if it will help!

 So. I’m prescribed 2mg Suboxone 2x a day, and 30mg IR Adderall 2x a day. I’ve been on the Suboxone for a solid 3 1/2 years, and the Adderall for about 9 months. I think background is required for this kind of question, idrk. But I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 12 years old. ADD and ADHD at 14. And PTSD at 19. I’m 23 years old now. 

 I’ve never been good at actually taking anti-depressants/anxiety meds. Nothing really worked for me. I’ve been prescribed countless medications that I’d take for a couple of weeks and forget about. I do know that they take time to work, but I’ve always felt like a lost cause when it comes to mental health. (Dark, I know. I had a shitty support system, mental illness is a myth in my family.) 

 But I finally got put on 75mg IR Venlafaxin (Effexor), and I honestly don’t remember it ever making a difference, but I kept up with it because my fiancé, (boyfriend at the time), wanted to see me make an effort at ‘fixing’ my mental illness. I stopped taking it 2 years ago after getting pregnant and haven’t actually committed to taking anything since. 

 I’ve been prescribed to Xanax on and off since I was 12, most recently was a year ago. 0.5mg 2x day. Never really been into any drugs that weren’t Opiates, and Xanax was definitely not my thing. 

 My doctor thinks I’m currently taking 1x 2mg Abilify. Every time I’ve seen him, for the past 3 months, I’ve told him how sedated and asshole-like it makes me feel, but his opinion is that it just hasn’t started working yet. I took it for about 2 weeks, and it knocks me the fuck out. Even taking it at night, I wake up feeling like I’m still on something. No go. 

 My daughter is 15 months old now, she’s a fucking angel but my god, she started running before she even started crawling. My good days are good, not manic or too much, but when I start feeling like I’m getting depressed, I know I have about a week or two before I need to ask my mom to watch my daughter for a couple of days. I’m always anxious though. I can’t go out in public or to the mailbox, unless it’s dark and I know there’s little to no people around. I’ve always just kinda dealt with that. Until today. My daughter ran out of formula today. I give her a bottle when she wakes up in the morning, and before she goes to sleep at night. 

 We woke up this morning, and I wanted to die when I realized that I didn’t actually have that other can of formula I swore I did. So I panicked. Then I sucked it up, got my daughter dressed, drove to the store, and I sat in the car for 15 minutes listening to my baby cry, knowing that she was hungry, and I still couldn’t force myself to go inside. We went home with no formula and I ugly cried the whole time I fed her blackberries and plain oatmeal. 

 I don’t think my doctor knows how severe my anxiety is and can get. Or maybe he thinks I’m being dramatic, idk. Anti-depressants have never helped with my anxiety, regardless of numerous doctors telling me that they will. I gave up on trying to treat my anxiety a long time ago, but every day now it gets harder to be a good parent when I’m drowning in anxiety. 

 So basically this long, seemingly pointless post, is just because I’m wondering if there’s a medication that won’t have me waking up a week from now wondering where my asshole is, but also one that won’t make me feel like I’m taking advil in hopes that it’ll prevent me from hyperventilating on the way to take the trash out.

Is it safe to stop taking the xanax cold turkey?

Friday night I took a quarter bar, didn’t feel too much (I think I might have anxiety and depression but I’m not diagnosed and I’m realizing now that might be important info). Saturday morning I took more than I took the night before and that’s where I blacked out. I have no memory of anything but taking Xanax on Saturday but I called my girlfriend and apparently had a normal conversation with her.

Sunday I wake up in a hospital bed detoxing. Apparently I called my girlfriend over and over while she was at work and once she picked up I was obviously super fucked up. She came over, called poison control who told her to call 911. An ambulance picked me up and apparently I was conscious the whole time but I obviously don’t remember anything.

The weird part of the story is the 3 suicide notes my girlfriend found in my apartment. I have suicidal thoughts sometimes but I’m nowhere close to attempting when I’m sober. I also had this vision where I saw my body laying on a floating piece of white silk in basically what you would imagine heaven to be. I was clothed in a white robe. 

I’ve just been trying to figure out if I wrote the suicide notes because I thought I was dead? Or did I take enough Xanax to kill my fear of killing myself, so I took the rest of the stash as an attempt even though I know 40mg xanax wouldn’t likely kill me. By the way I never mentioned that I was going to kill myself in the notes. It was more on the lines of I’ve wanted to be dead for a long time. 

Moral of the story: don’t use Xanax recreationally you idiots. I know I’ll be doing more the next time I get my hands on it but if there are any kids out there who are curious don’t fucking do it.

There was nothing to do, the unit was a sweat box, and everyone was at each other’s throat. Three fights erupted over that brief period. I was one of them.

It resulted in my first fighting ticket. My hand is still fucked up–purplish and swollen–but I’ve got no other injuries. Someone said that’s how you know you won, or at least didn’t lose: your hands hurt but your face doesn’t.

This has been a long time coming. I’ve been in one fight in the county and one last year, in the bathroom, pre-arranged and refereed. But this was the first time where I didn’t have to, where it was a spur of the moment affair. Not that I’ve stayed bullshit-free the past year. But with a pending case where my behavior faced intense scrutiny, I had sought to avoid as many tickets as possible. There has definitely been at least 2 or 3 occasions where I should have fought, and probably would have if I didn’t think I had a chance at parole soon or didn’t have this case looming over me. Regardless, I’m non-confrontational by nature; I’d rather throw money at a problem than handle it physically.

On the other hand, I knew I’d have a real bit to do once I got sentenced; I needed to put on a demo early on, so that the constant bullshit I was dealing with would end sooner than later. (A demo is prison slang for demonstration, by making it publicly known that you will fight.) The problem with spending your way out of situations is that eventually you run out money. Also, this being prison, people watch carefully, and their predatory instinct kicks in, and they will devise or force a situation that gives them a reason to tax and squeeze as much money as possible.

For example, a few months ago a situation arose when I owed a dude $25 on store day. When I brought the guy his money that day (5 coffees, a peanut butter, a couple meat sticks and soups), he insisted that we agreed to “no coffees”. Sans coffee, I would be well short. I knew this guy levied exorbitant late fees beforehand, so it wasn’t a surprise when he threatened to double the balance if I didn’t have it by the end of the day, and then again, every day late after that. But this no coffee thing was a complete surprise (and completely fabricated). After a little digging around, his end-game quickly became apparent: he didn’t want to be paid on time so he could double it a few times, and then blame me for why he didn’t have any dough for one of the big dogs of the yard to whom he owed hundreds of dollars. Of course, he’d be expected to take off on me if I still didn’t have or refused to pay the money after a week or so.

Not wanting to be someone’s scapegoat, I scrambled that night and was able to swap the coffees by yard’s close, so the situation was dead before it got started. This is what bothered me most–out of the 5 or 6 guys that owed him, he singled me out specifically, so that when it escalated to physical violence, he expected that I wouldn’t do anything in return, and if I did, that he’d be able to beat me pretty easily. Granted, I was the target by default because his other options had either paid for protection, or belonged to his organization. Still, the fact that he’d even attempt something so scandalous on me stuck in my craw. I guess it dawned on me then that in this dog-eat-dog jungle, there were hyenas that considered me prey. Sure, I preferred not to fight and remain civilized, but I had reached my limit. Whether I had to do a few more years or a bunch, this perception, which allowed someone to consider that a feasible strategy, had to be seriously altered, if not completely rewritten. I didn’t want to start fights, but neither did I want to be known as soft as Charmin’.

The problem was that there was no smooth, convincing way to mention how I fought once in the county and then once for a brief moment in the bathroom, especially when the majority of the few people present for that were no longer here. I’d sound like a virgin who swore he had sex the past summer with a girl from Canada or his cousin’s friend in another state or something equally unbelievable.

I could go around puffing my chest out and avowing to beat anyone’s ass who would try to steal from or run game on me, but I don’t think I’d be convincing. My word would quickly be tested–I had seen that a bunch of times. One of my old bunkies, fresh from quarantine, promised that if anyone stole his TV or store bag, as had recently happened in the cube, he’d “fuckin kill em.” Two weeks later, he picks up his secure pack and once he got back to the unit, a big black guy blew down on him with some tough talk about getting his bag taken and my bunkie wilted fast under the pressure. Like a complete hoe, he literally handed the guy $15-20 to leave him alone. Then, that guy went to the front hall and told some kids what happened. Once word got around that my bunkie was sweet (meaning, someone you can squeeze a lot of money out of), he was accosted in the same way 3 or 4 more times. By the time I returned to the unit with my secure pack, he only had 3 bags of coffee and a deodorant left out of a $100 bag, the remnant hidden strategically in our cubies’ lockers.

So, fast forward to last week: I legitimately owed Dell a $20 tax because of how short I was last store and how much longer it took for me to pay the original tab. As far as taxes go, it was a little harsher than the standard rate (which is 1.5 the original amount, but on store day many people charge double), and plus, I had already agreed. I planned on collecting what was owed me first and then paying from that, instead of out of my bag with shit I actually want.

However, the weekend before store, which was on Thursday, Dell was moved up to my unit and assigned a bunk in the cube before mine. He was a bug so I knew he’d be watching my every move, especially if I was carrying money, but I wasn’t gonna give him anything until store.

On Tuesday, he asked if I was gonna have his $30 on store; immediately, I objected to the amount, and asked how it was that. He grumbled about how late I was and how I still owed on the original debt (which, technically, was true, but by one soup, or .35). He seemed unwilling to consider his math was wrong, so I didn’t press the issue, and reassured him that I’d have it, but he’d have to wait a little after they passed out bags.

Thursday rolls around, and we get store during count. I’m in the first few cubes so I’m one of the first to get my bag, and on my way back, bag strung over my shoulder, I walk by Dell, who’s standing in his cube’s entryway and eyeing me intently but doesn’t say anything. I count out what I owe to others while they’re still passing out bags and pay my most important bills to two dudes down the hall. I’m thinking, all right this is less stressful than normal, and review the list of who owes me. Of course, Beard, who’s in my cube, has a song and a dance about how he’ll have it when yard breaks; I should know by now he’s a professional spin artist.

I’m opening a bag of Now&amp;Laters when Dell approaches the front of my cube but addressing me still in the hallway. I notice how he slightly flexes his arms and balls his hands into fists.

“Where the fuck is my shit, man?” he asks in a voice with much more bass in it than normal.

I calmly tell him to give me until this afternoon, which is what I said two days ago, and remind him of that.

He growls and says, among other things, fuck that, he needs it now, before the store carts leave. By this point every one in my cube is watching our exchange and so are some people across the hall. He walks back to his cube, and I go to my locker to count some money out.

I figure that I might as well pay him now to avoid situation. But, at the same time, I’m fucking heated. I dont like being talked to like a bitch when you know I’m gonna pay. I’m way short of $20, and Chicken, my cubie, sees that. He offers to lend me the money without a tax, but I’m so mad about how Dell was talking to me that I’m cursing under my breath, and reply that I almost wanna take this situation to the bathroom.

Charlie, who’s Chicken’s bunkie and petty as fuck, is like, “Well, make sure to get my two bucks before you do,” and laughs, because he knows I’ll go to the hole if we get caught fighting. I can tell he interprets my bluster with skepticism. But I cool down, and I’m like, fuck it I’ll pay him now.

Chicken and I count out the food, and it comes to $20.11 or something like that. I carry it over to Dell, and hand it to off him. He goes, “If this ain’t $30, I dont even want it. I need it all nigga.”

“Well, fuck it then, it’s $20 that’s what I owe you,” I reply.

“Nah nigga, it’s $30. I need my fucking money.” His voice is still 2 octaves lower than usual, but he’s getting progressively louder. I see heads peeking out of cubes down at the end of the hall.

“You can’t just make shit up and say that’s what I owe you, bro.” I stomp back to my cube, but I remain by the entrance. I’m really fucking angry now, and my cubies are all looking at me like, what the fuck is going on? I declare, to no one in particular, that I’m not paying an extra ten bucks for no reason. Chicken offers that he’s got it if I want it, but I decline. If I coughed up the money now, people would believe I’d give them any amount of money as long as they talked to me recklessly and threatened me with physical retribution.

Dell strides over to my cube again, and I can see from his body language that he’s angry as fuck and feeling aggressive.

“What the fuck, nigga? Nigga, I need my money now, I don’t give a fuck about who you owe, nigga I need my shit. I dont wanna have to whoop your ass.”

There’s a few things going on here I should point out. First, I’m white and he’s black. In the joint, if you’re white you’re considered soft until you prove otherwise. (I know that’s “unfair” and “prejudiced”, but it’s kinda true. White people don’t stand up for themselves half the time.)*

Secondly, this is my first time dealing with him, but he knows I have a reputation for paying my debts, and I have the resources to get another $10 if I really needed to. He knows I’m not gonna punch him for trying a squeeze play (although I should have). Basically, he thinks I’m gonna be his sweet thing. Luckily, I already had it in my head : this ain’t that.

At this point, guys are standing on their bunks so they can see what the brouhaha is all about. I’m not backing down, and no matter how loud he is, I calmly refuse his demands. He threatens to beat me again, and takes a step back. I tell him I’m not giving him a penny more, and step up in his face. I’m a half foot taller than he is, so I’m towering over him, and I know I’m provoking him. Essentially, I’m calling his bluff and alpha-dogging him.

Predictably, he throws a punch off-balance, but it’s enough to break my glasses and get me to back up. I can’t really see shit but I know he’s expecting that to serve as a warning and I’ll jus go get his shit right then. Instead, I catch my breath for a split second, look around (the whole unit is watching now, having heard the fracas), and then I do a little 1-2 hop and swing at his face with all my weight behind me. I can see the look of total surprise right before I connect. He stumbles, and I hit him again, on the side of the head, and he tackles me to the ground. We’ve fallen to the middle of my cube, wrestling, and I eat another punch. I hear a bunch of people yelling to stop as I get him in a headlock with my left arm, and deliver as many quick, hard jabs to his chin with my right.

Then, some guys intervened, and yanked him away from me, outta my reach. Dell tries to hurry out of the cube before the cops (not literally, actually the COs) arrive, but one’s only five feet away when Dell leaves my cube, and cuffs him up. A bunch of yard cops hustle behind him 15 seconds later, and ask who the other one was. I volunteer myself, by stepping forward and putting my hands behind my back. I can tell they’re surprised because I don’t catch tickets; conversely, Dell is well-known among the police, because he should’ve been home a year ago if he didn’t catch so many major misconducts.

They take me to medical to check for injuries. I’m painfully aware of my fingers, which are now throbbing, and probably broken, as my adrenaline subsides, but otherwise I don’t feel a thing.

The lieutenant asks for a statement from Dell, who refuses, and then me, and I follow suit. I could explain how he was trying to squeeze me or even that he hit me first, so that I’ll receive less days of sanctions when I get found guilty on the ticket. But a week or two of less LOP isn’t worth being called a rat for the remainder of my bit. They’ll review the cameras regardlessly and see how it played out; they’ve already designated him the aggressor without a word from me, so I can be expect some leniency.

In the past, you were almost guaranteed to ride out after a fight, but since the covid crisis, they just put you in the hole for a day or two tops and then return you to general population. Luckily, I had only spent like 4 hours in the hole before I was let out, and I had so many endorphins and testerone flooding my brain that it wasn’t bad at all. I felt like a conqueror, and euphoric as hell–it was the prison version of a post-coital glow. That fight released a ton of pent-up frustration.

In the world, the only thing that could erase so much stress was fucking, and that’s no longer an option for me (well, it is an option, but it’s certainly looked down upon and comes with a whole different set of issues). Fighting in prison is like a one-night stand: it’s incredibly refreshing if it’s been awhile, but if you do it too often, it’s considered kinda trashy. At least, people look at you differently if it’s a regular thing.

When I got back to the unit, everyone was surprised I got out so quickly, and I also noticed a new gleam of respect in their eyes. The vibe felt tangibly different.

A couple black guys came up to me and high-fived me, giving props for standing up for my shit. They tell me that what he did was bullshit. Shit, even Dell’s homeboys who were familiar with and peripherally involved in our business situation admit that he was wrong to try to get extra and even more wrong to start a fight; he had led them to believe I still owed on the original balance. They assured me that no one’s gonna try to get revenge or anything. The situation was dead.

There’s a few guys I’m real cool with who actually have some pull on the yard, and they gave me props as well, and confided that they’d already been telling the yard I whooped his ass. I wouldn’t go that far, but I definitely had been getting the best of him right before we were separated.

Additionally, it’s a bad look for a black dude to lose a fight to a white guy; worse than it would be if it were the other way around. That’s really a moot point–the important thing is to put up a fight, regardless if you win. As far as I’m concerned, I’m just elated that everyone now knows that I’ll fight back; that I’m nobody’s sweet thing; and that I’ll stand up for myself.

Colloquially, I was earning my stripes. Or, even better, getting my ‘rones up.**

* Shit, even in the world this is true; no body but a white person feels guilt for being the race that they are. It’s one thing to apologize for and disapprove of what your ancestors did; it’s a whole ‘nother thing to abase yourself with apologies for being white and by transparently wishing for the extinction of your race. In my personal experience (and just by virtue of my incarceration, I’ve had and continue to regularly have way more interactions with minorities than 90% of whites), minorities appreciate and respect the former, but disdain the latter.

Recently I started reading myself into the world of psychadelics, bc they are really interesting to me and I really want to try some in the future. But I see A LOT of people that act like psychadelics are the key to understanding the concept of this world. I belive that psychadelics can REALLY expand your view on things in a positive way and that you cam learn a lot from them, due to the in depth thoughts you have. But telling people that have never tried psychadelics that they will show you the ""truth"" of the concept of this world is really bad imo. You mostly just want people to think the way you do. (Ofc not all the time!) Saying that a drug opens up your entire view on life is kinda fucked up in itself. Ofc it can help you figure your thoughts out but telling someone ""take LSD, you'll understand afterwards."" is really not a good thing to do. 



I also saw a picture of a quote (?) that said ""LSD is illegal bc the governmemt doesn't want us to know the truth"". I find this kinda problematic. Do you guys really belive the world would be like THAT if the government ""knew what life is really about""? I understand that people try to find a deeper meaning in things and this can lead to a conspiracy-like thought-process, but a statement like the above is just nonsence. It might even be kinda dangerous. Why would it harm the government if we all ""woke up""? If you disagree with me, please tell me why and try to make me understand your thought process! 

I am pretty sure that this post might get some hate but before thinking ""she's stupid"" try to tell me your point of view and what you think about my above mentioned opinion.

I remember hitting the bong a few times and not feeling anything so I just kept hitting it for a total of like 6 or 7 times. It was then that I felt it. The way the colors looked changed, and the body high was so intense. My brain felt really weird too. Everything looked HD. I was going over my past in my head and it honestly felt like my life is not what I thought it was, I'm not sure how to describe the feeling but it made me question a lot of things. Like who is really in charge, why do I exist, what is life etc. I was starting to feel VERY uneasy. It didn't help that my cousin is really into conspiracy theories and it just so happens that a video about the holocaust was playing. I started to feel like something very sinister is going on behind the veil, that perhaps we're all trapped in a hellish simulation. It all felt so hopeless like I was seeing the truth behind my life, that there's no loving God, etc. The days and week following this were a disaster for me as well. I could write a book about it but I started getting delusional. I thought it made perfect sense that I was Jesus and that I came here to save it. My delusions made no sense either. I would also stop believing I was Jesus and that I was more like Moses. But I really believed Jesus was coming back very soon like later that week soon. It's kind of funny thinking back but it's also very sad and traumatizing because I was telling everyone I could that Jesus would come back any second now. One day I drove to my cousin's house and told him that I kept having visions and dreams of the government wanting to capture me and seeing myself going to prison for idk knowing too much or maybe because I had somehow disconnected from the matrix. Like I felt like I was operating at a frequency I was not supposed to operate in. Like I was too awake compared to everyone else. The delusions got so bad, I started getting really ¨immersed¨ in this delusional world. I would start having actual visual hallunications of people having slits in their eyes.  In my mind I thought I had gained the ability to tell if someone has demons inside them or not. Oh going back to what my cousin's reaction was when I told him all of this , he actually got worried and slapped me and told me to think about how I used to be before I smoked the weed. And that's when it hit me hard. I started crying because I realized I had gone crazy without even realizing it for a few weeks. There's more that happened but this is getting long. I also got in a car accident because I believed I was being chased by demons and I actually felt bullets entering my body as I sped up to 80 mph in 30 mph zone. It was THAT real. When I crashed, I actually saw with the naked eye 3 reapers to my right, holding what I think I remember to be AK-47s in their hands. I thought they were going to shoot me so I closed my eyes and prayed to God. I told him I wasn't ready to go. I also felt my soul was being drained from my body. I was starting to forget all my memories, but then it all suddenly came back. When I reopened my eyes the reapers were gone. I thought God had given me another chance or perhaps I had jumped to another reality where I didn't actually die. Like quantum immortality or some shit. I haven't done drugs in years but I still think about it everyday and feel like they're calling me back. I keep thinking everything I experienced was actually real but we're not supposed to believe in those things so they just put us back to sleep in our normal everyday lives. Just feels like the whole simulation theory is real. If anyone can relate to this and wants to chat PM me. There's a lot more that happened to me which I can go in detail if anyone is interested. I had experiences where I talked to Poseidon and other gods and also communicated with the DBZ universe, It's crazy I know but just felt very real at the time.

The worst part are always the best because I don’t act out my experience I sit and take it in. I feel my last trip was where all of everything fully clicked and the use of finding and bettering myself seems to have stopped only in the way that I can be me and change what I need without the drug. 

I lack socializing with friends now. Thinks started turning and now I don’t hardly ever see anyone. I never get invited even though they continue to do things. I’ll ask to make plans or invite them to do things and seem to get rejected. It hurts because I love them and seem like I got tossed to the side. Some is my own doing deleteing SoCal media’s. But I did that because it felt fake and the group I was in no longer was for me. I couldn’t get along with someone so I didn’t what’s best and removed myself. I have thoughts for them occasionally and makes me sad because I really do miss them. Tripping does take that hurt even if I am feeling the same missing feeling it’s just okay. In normal life it’s an effort and takes a toll sometimes. I’d say I’m introverted at times and when social I’m spotty not fearful just difficult having real connection though I do want it, from experience though I cannot ever keep friends and always end up hurt. 

My trust broken and will continue to be broken breaks me. But I rebuild. I don’t want to trip to escape but to find a for of acceptance of burdens and struggles. I feel my most self/ normal when tripping. It sounds like addiction but its not numbing pain making me comfortably numb but bring the pain out filling me and that’s what wakes me up. I enjoy the after glow sometimes even more than tripping. But my promise was to not trip until I find some with a similar spiritual level (Buddhist &amp; Hindu type perspectives. 

It would help if I feel alone on a mountain or full of “goodness”. 

I want to do it at the family property because it’s also where I can feel at home. That would be the only acceptation to my promise.

But hopefully you comments will do something. Not saying I’m doing what everyone say but just reading what people have to say usually help. Even if the outcome is nothing.

I would like to write and ebook about being addicted to MJ and how to avoid addiction and going into the loop of smoking every day, making it the worst habit of them all. The main premise would be how to incorporate weed into your life and not make it a toxic habit, throught the book I would be quitting alongside, making writing that book a good habit that got me out of it. I would be focusing on the scientifically proven health facts  and benefits, but also on  all the negative effect that can possibly ruine your social relationships and life goals. Something like that, I think you can get the concept

Sure, one of the motivations is to make some cash out of it to support my studentlife but I seriously want to tackle the topic of weed addiction and how it is the best and the worst drug there is, and how careful everybody should be not to jump to conclusions about how ""good"" it can be.

Lets say i smoked, and then they say i have to take the test in 3 hours and i just drink as much water i can ”3-4 L” just pee and drink, and repeat until mypiss isn’t any colour anymore. Then i just take the test and its negative.
I understand that in some test it just cant read it or whatever but this works on so many tests ive taken now.

My plan was to take them separately throughout the lockdown (I bought them just before we went into lockdown just incase I wouldn’t be able to get some for a while, and needed something to do whilst I wasn’t allowed out of the house). 

I’d done MD for the first time at uni with my mates in February, and then I’d done it a further 3 times by the 18th of March ( I know it’s a lot and I don’t intend on ever doing it that often ever again). Every time I did it at uni, I had done pure crystals. My friend who brought them, let’s call him T, got them from the same person every time, and we put them into empty paracetamol capsules, and then swallowed them. Me and T are a similar size, so we both dosed between 100-180mg. Out of the 4 times I took MD, I only ever had one really bad comedown, but it didn’t have a physical effect on me (e.g I didn’t feel sick or have a headache) 

So, it got to the 30th of April, and I decided I was going to take one of the pills. Because I didn’t get them through T, they weren’t pure crystals, they were instead pingers (specifically the ones with the Skype symbol on). I crushed the pill and took a half, and then ten minutes later took the other half. The come up felt exactly the same as every other time, as did how I felt while I was “up”. Stupidly, I decided to take the second pill pretty much straight after I’d come up from the first pill, because it felt fucking amazing. I really enjoyed my night, listened to some music and chilled out, called one of my friends, whatever. 

I woke up the next day and my head felt like someone had sucked my brain out, and I felt like I was gonna be sick every time I moved. I’d never felt like this on a “comedown”. 

I’m new to the MD scene, so I don’t know why this time I felt so bad the next day. Personally, I think it’s a mix of the fact that I took 2 pills that were sold to me as 200mg each, making my dosage over 200mg more than I had ever done, and the fact that I barely drank any water (I’m usually in a club with T and other friends when I drop, who are always making sure we drink and stay hydrated).

I’ve tripped on acid about 20 times now, and on mushrooms somewhere between 5 and 10 times. I’ve also done dxm maybe 15 or so times and I’ve obviously smoked a decent amount of weed, but I am fairly sensitive to it. Prior to the trip I created a playlist, didn’t take my prescribed adderal for a few days, didn’t smoke, and tries to get in a positive mindset. I hadn’t tripped in about a month and due to increased frequency in the past a lot of my trips haven’t been as good as they could have been. I consumed kava before dosing two tabs of very strong acid. I’m not sure the dose (I don’t trust what dealers claim the dose is and I can’t remember what the dealer told me anyway) but one tab had me extremely fucked up the last trip I had, very mindfucky. After dosing two I laid down for a bit, but quickly realized I was going to be very bored if I waited for the comeup, so I took a very small hit from my thc pen. I wasn’t expecting much from it, but it changed the whole trip, even after the weed should have worn off. I felt a little panicky and paranoid a few different times, and I noticed that in comparison to other drugs and combos I had done in the past, it was really fucking hard to think or rationalize any thoughts I had. I didn’t completely freak out, but I was slightly uncomfortable for a while. I believe I had ego death, which I wrote about a few days prior:


I felt uncomfortable for a long period of time, my brain conflicting and unable to rest. After a while I no longer had the urge to urinate, and my anxieties lessened. I began to feel more comfortable physically, and I didn’t feel like there was anything I needed to do with my body. The patterns that encompassed my vision were not bright, but were still very pronounced and intense regardless. They appeared to be a little dirty and dark, but not in a negative or a scary way. I felt a pull towards something (mentally not physically) and I remembered what I had been focusing on prior to this experience. I let go of myself and let this pull take a hold of me. I felt as if I was leaving my body, my mind, everything that made me myself. I no longer felt like a person, or felt like I had an identity. It was as if I had merged with the patterns and sensations and no longer existed, at least not in the way I had defined existence prior to this feeling. My eyes felt as if they were polyps of some alien plant life, and I felt waves of euphoria, although I could not identify where they were or where I was. For a moment I felt as if I would cry, like I was mourning my own death, but this feeling lasted less than a moment. I felt at peace, and I felt a euphoria that I don’t know how to describe. This experience only lasted a few moments, and I afterwards I could hardly believe it had happened. I entered this state two more times, but each time it faded after a while, and I reflected on the experience each time. It’s very hard to describe what I was feeling, but the peace I felt was perhaps more pure than any I had felt before. I believe this was an ego death experience, and I have decided to take a break for a significant period of time from certain activities and focus on my own health and my ability to enjoy my life and my sobriety. I believe that there is more for me to learn and experience, but I also believe that I need time away from this to appreciate it more fully and to take the feelings and thoughts I had that night into my life. I’ve felt good the days prior to this experience, and my mood seems to be better than normal. I have also been having deeper sleep and more vivid dreams, but this could be unrelated to the described experience.


Regardless of whether this was ego death or not, letting go felt amazing, and the trip overall was one of the best I’ve ever had. Sometimes when I get high, I want to stop doing drugs because I get too high and freak out, but the feeling goes away by the time I’m sober and I end up going back. This time was the opposite. The trip was amazing, but I realized when I was tripping that at the point in my life I’m at rn, a break, or at least significantly decreased frequency of use for a long period of time, is a good idea. I still feel this way now, and I think this trip was a very healthy thing for me.

sorry for the bad english but hope u understand

(little background. so i was a beginner smoker i barerly even knew u can trip from weed and the situation in my life and everything wastn that good back then) so right when i took the hit it felt terrible but i didnt puke. it was insta hit i was so high i didnt understand what my friends were talking bout so then my first friend went to say like ""when are your parents getting home"" there wasnt any worries about that they would have came home in like 2 days but idk what hitted in my brains i just started thinking and thinking i couldn't find the solution then everything went crazy i only saw like one or two colours they matched to the walls where we were (we were in sauna) it was like orange and like the shittiest color of yellow u can think of. i saw my friends there and i cannot describe how i saw them i could draw it but the real picture i can only remeber in my brains and when my friends were talking to me u like really cant slow any speach down so much it would feel like that one word was like extremely long like i mean EXTREMELY. it seems like bullshit but i can say it felt that i was in that world like 1-2 years like i knownobody willl ever understand what it was but for real i can say it was a long long time. people will probably say ""yeah it wasnt that long"" but ffs it was. then idk what happened but i felt sideways when i was sitting and i somehow saw that in third person and then i started to see world with my own eyes but i tried to attack my friends because i thought they ruined my life exc. i wasnt in this world i was scary and yeah. i have videos of me in that stage of time and i can say i was hell a scary then out of nowhere i got back in this world and my first thing i said was like ""whats the time"" or whats the day"" my friends told me that it was 15minutes i couldnt believe that i just laughed or something like 5mins straight. it was scary experience and i can say if this happened to you. you would aswell say nobody ever has had this bad of a trip. everything like my mindset location the colors infront of me affected that i got this bad of a trip. next time when i smoked weed i tripped again but that wasnt that bad i thought i saw a gorge of my last trip and somehow it seemd like the bad trip i had the first time. and always after that i could have not relaxed from weed like i used to. all the anxiety and paranoid thoughts is there nowadays i trip every time i use weed. i surerly got some kind of ego death cause since then i havent anymore be the same i dont talk that much but it has affected me in a good way aswell.

It doesn’t surprise me because he’s been on it  forever and the last time he sold me weed (22 grams) there was a little crystal of meth in the bag. May have been more but we were smoking that shit all the time and we didn’t notice until the bag was almost empty. 

I have two questions:

1. Should I have told him that I found meth in the bag? This was months ago now and although I normally sell weed I never sold it to anyone so it was just me and a friend smoking it and we aren’t really squeamish about doing harder shit. Kinda a no harm no foul type of situation, but I feel like I maybe should have told him? Opinions?

2. How do I go about trying to buy meth from him without like freaking him out? I used to work with him so it’s not like he is only a weed guy to me, but I have never even talked to him about meth. He lives with one of my favorite managers (who is also on meth) so it’s not hard for me to know that they are both doing it. I just want to find a way to ask him to find me some without him thinking I’m going to like set him up or anything, bc there’s a guy in town spewing lies about me snitching on him (I didn’t, everyone just knows that this guy went to prison for drugs and he can find shit🤷🏻‍♂️) also, the person he lives with CANT know that I’m going to be doing it, bc she’s almost like a mother to me and she would beat tf out of me. How do I  slip in for him to not tell her?

I hope all who read this are safe and well during this pandemic. Due to the circumstances we are in, **I am offering free facilitation of 'The Work of Byron Katie' worksheets or free informal psychological support**. Those familiar with 'The Work' and are interested in guided facilitation can freely message me personally, and in return we can relate over Skype (or a similar platform as suitable).

Such correspondence can of course be completely anonymous, and privacy and wellness of being is paramount to me.

**About me:**

For around 5 years now I have been relentlessly dedicated to The Work. I own all of Byron Katie's audio that is available to purchase (obsessive, I know!) and listen to at least an hour of content per day - and far more now during lockdown! I have listened to (collectively) thousands of hours of The Work being facilitated by Katie, and it is a never-ending path towards greater fulfilment for myself. I would sincerely love to pass this experience on for others, please feel free to message if you would be interested at all - it would truly be my privilege.

Alternatively, I greatly recommend exploring The Work of Byron Katie for free on YouTube, her podcasts online or with her copyright audio free to download: [http://web.archive.org/web/20160318085027/http://www.everypathis.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20160318085027/http://www.everypathis.org/) . I cannot describe in words how profound an effect this material and 'The Work' has had on me.

I look forward greatly to your messages, be safe, look after family and friends - and know that there is always someone willing to listen to your situation.

All the best, and much love. ❤️

The withdrawals are so bad I couldn’t even imagine this! So please give me some advice. 

Tomorrow I’m seeing a new psychiatrist about my klonopin because of insurance switches I was almost not able to get it and was glad I had a small etizolam stash left and my father gave me some of his prescription (he has a cyst that gives him seizures). 

I don’t want really trust dr for putting me on Klonopin in the first place but my prescription is for .5 morning and .5 night. I between that time I was on non prescription etizolam ranging from 5 to 20 mg a day... 
In 3 months I very rapidly tapered down to about 3mg of the etizolam. I have some left but my stock pile is about out but I don’t want to use that for tapering anyways. 

Now I’m serious about getting off this and lately I confessed to my parents that I was taking Etizolam. They don’t get the withdrawals and think they should be over by now. my mom keeps my prescription and gives me 3 a day (plus a pill of my dads) about 2mg is where my klonopin need to be a day but I don’t want to keep taking my dads. This is what I got according to Aston Manuel 

What should I tell the doctor? That .5mg isn’t enough and I need 1mg to then taper easier on my own prescription? Idk how to approach that I need a higher dose to get off eventually. All I know is .5 2x a day is killing me

I don’t want to say to the dr I was taking etizolam and I don’t wanna say I was taking my dads prescription. 

I hear too many stories of people sounding like drug seekers and I don’t blame them but I feel I can’t be honest..

I just seriously feel like my brain can’t feel like any fucking joy right now, I feel drained and just completely dissociated from everything. All I want to do when I wake up is sleep so I don’t have to face the long, dreary day that I know I’m going to be faced with. I have a loving bf but I literally feel nothing when he’s trying to comfort me.

1) Can a drug experience like that fuck you up this bad? ( I’ve done worse in terms of psychedelics and had hard comedowns but I’ve always bounced back)
2) any tips on improving my mental state? What do you guys do to tackle comedowns (if we can treat it like that).

It is chronic pain with no bacteria identified. I was going to go to school but just dropped out due to this condition. I'm unemployed and unmotivated.

After quiting I expected more energy and motivation, better memory for school. I honestly just feel worse. The withdrawls only lasted a couple weeks and I've had a full appetite and my mood rebounded quickly. I just have no motivation at all. I feel like I don't even want money anymore, it seems pointless.

I don't want to slave away at school to slave away at a job. Maybe I'm just a piece of shit idk lol. I had a decent job before this stuff started I was actually making good money for my age.

Now I just barely have any motivation. Probably due to chronic health issues and pain. I want to just use cannabis again and whatever I need to deal with the pain but I also know it effects my short term memory. I want to do something but I don't have the energy or motivation lol. 

Exercise helps somewhat. I just wish I could heal from this shit and go on with my life.

I don’t advise anyone to do drugs at that age but Anyway, here are all the drugs I tried in chronological order. It started when I was 16 but most of my experiences were when I was 17.

1. Alcohol: it’s nice at parties or when chilling with some friends, gets me in a good mood and makes it easier to engage in conversations, even though after a few drinks it might get hard to get these conversations going...
Also, hangovers are horrible and you don’t want to abuse this drug.

2. Weed: I was a stoner for a little more than a year, it’s great because it made me dream and wander in my mind. I loved going for hikes while listening to music or just browsing the internet. There were very few people I smoked with because most were not making me feel comfortable, there were 2-3 people I could vibe with while high and that’s why most of the time I smoked alone. On higher doses it can be very psychedelic and I loved that, it made me a little more creative and open minded. It’s easy to get psychically addicted and it started making me lazy and always tired, that’s why I decided to stop.

3. Benzos (xanax) These were prescribed to me because of my insomnia, depression and anxiety but I rapidly learned to use them as a drug. Either on itself or mixing with weed. You should really avoid benzos, they made me really sloppy, would fall over all the time, feelings didn’t exist anymore and then I would just fall asleep. The worst is that after sleeping for 18 hours, I couldn’t even remember what I did. That’s how I forgot 4 months of my life. I got really addicted and the moment I stopped was when I overdosed and ended up in the ER and then in a mental hospital for a whole month. 
Lesson: don’t start fucking with benzos.

4. Ecstasy. I tried it 3 times and only once at a night club, even though I left once it kicked in. I loved doing E alone in my room or while going for a hike. It’s such an incredible feeling of euphoria, warmth, love and the music dude! The music!!! It’s basically an orgasme x100 all over your body that lasts 3 hours. Had an awesome talk with my best friend while on it and that’s also something worth mentioning. I’m not saying I want to do it again, but if I do, I want it to be with a girl. You know why...


5. LSD that was the drug that saved my life, I took it as some last hope to save myself from sucide. Even though my first trip was the most intense, horrifying and Alien experience I had during my entire life. I don’t regret it. It showed me what death was and showed me things I could never describe in human language. After that first trip, I never wanted to hurt myself again and started to see the world differently. Had 8 trips in total and except that first one, all of them were great. I always went in with an intention and always came out with answers and found ways to better myself. My last trip showed me a lot and I’m not thinking about doing it again. It’s truly a magical and powerful substance that deserves so much respect. Don’t underestimate it.

6. Shrooms. Now, I don’t have a lot of experience with that because the only 2 times I took them they were wild liberty caps and it was a really low dose. Barely some brighter colors, some letters on my phone we’re moving and I just felt really happy and euphoric. I’m currently growing my own shrooms so I can hopefully have a real trip on them.


7. Salvia, now that’s a weird substance, definitely not a fan of it but damn you need to try it once. Smoked from a bong, as I was putting it down it was already hitting me, I jumped in bed and closed my eyes. I was heavy and it felt as I was spinning. Ended up in some flower field from a weird happy dimension but with the feeling of something being wrong. It’s a really intense and weird drug but I personally don’t like the effects and the taste.

8. Nitrous oxide, tried it once, not a fan. Just makes me laugh for 10 seconds and then my head hurts

9. Poppers, my coworker gifted me a bottle and I guess it was fun, because it doesn’t last long so you don’t think about it before taking it and because you can take that little bottle everywhere. It made my body feel so warm and that’s what I didn’t really like, and the smell too, it smells so bad.

10. Ketamine, that’s the last drug I tried and the best way to describe it is that it felt so good, that I don’t want to take it again because I know I would love it too much. My friend had it and I tried it when we were together. Didn’t do a lot, just enough to feel relaxed and kinda disconnected, like mixing alcohol, weed and benzos. It doesn’t last long and is very easy to abuse. My friend started doing it way too often, I can just tell by looking at her. She looks like a zombie and lost so much weight.

There were some drugs I didn’t count in like tobacco that I only tried once and hated, some meds I couldn’t remember the name, sleeping pills and codeine cough drops that my grandpa gave me and I kinda took too much (in a good way) when taking a bath.

Don’t do drugs, especially when you’re young, or just stay with weed. I don’t regret anything and I always did a lot of research before trying something. Some drugs helped a lot to understand the world and it’s a reason I’m still alive. Though it’s very easy to start abusing drugs, the problem is you won’t notice it until it’s too late. That’s why I’m doing good now, been following my dreams and not trying to escape the real world, because no matter the drug. There’s a reason we’re living in this reality, it’s a beautiful place and you shouldn’t try to escape it.

MDMA/Molly - when i take this, i’m never sad/depressed during the comedown or the next day. I follow the 3 month rule. Whenever i see any reports of other people doing this they say they’re saddened during the comedown or the next day, but this doesn’t happen to me.

He gave me clonazepam for these heart issues.

One month later i end my bottle of clonazepam and go again to continue my use but this time they gave me Diazepam. I been on 30mg\~ diazepam for almost 2 months by now.

I used benzos last year and didn't felt even close to the anxiety i feel now that i am trying to stop.i stopped them past year so smoothly i dont even remember caring about withdrawals, i just got upset that my fun was over.

I realized i have to stop taking benzos because of the underlaying problem:one day they switched me from diazepam to Xanax and it did not feel close to what i was on.Then taking 2,5mg of diazepam made me go through the day.

I want to quit benzos, but i'm really fucking afraid of the withdrawals.

i am avoiding diazepam at maximum and taking 0.5 clonazepam fraction of a pill to not seizure or shit.

i am afraid the withdrawals to make my HPPD much worse than it actually is.i am afraid it rebounces so badly my PTSD and all mental illness to get stronger than me.

anybody has experiences like this? there is any way, i can stop benzos and not hallucinate and not seizure, or not having a heart attack?? i spent so much money on these Xanax that would just make me worse.

I am not stopping cold turkey because i am afraid of seizuring, heart attacks, hallucinations, so i am taking these extremely low doses, just to get my feet on ground.

I've been smoking weed everyday for about 15 years. I remember buying ""George W. Kush"" in my highschool bathroom and getting ripped off. I remeber when you could only reliably get titanium nails and anyone with a quartz banger was considered lush. I've been in tha game for a long time. I never got a med card because I could buy it for way cheaper. I sort of recently moved and decided to get a med card so I don't have to drive an hour each way if I'm in a pinch. 

So its definitely convenient as fuck but seriously this whole thing is so obviously just a loophole to smoke legal weed. I made the appointment. It was a telehealth appointment with a nurse practitioner. It was 50 US Dollars and badabing. She asks what's wrong with me. I tell her ""insomnia and ADHD.""
""Are you being treated for the ADHD?""
""Yes my Doctors name is blah blah blah""
""What's his practices name?""
""To be honest I went once and he just kind of fills my scripts once in a while I can't remember its been so long.""
""OK don't worry about it. Ill send you a temp card while your physical one comes in the mail. Do you promise not to drive or operate heavy machinery while under the influence...""
That was it. Done. Now I can buy weed legally.

So then I go to the dispensary. There is like 7 in my immediate area so the prices were pretty competitive, which was a nice. Hash oil is pretty expensive and its no cheaper from my friend so I went for that. I get into the place. Theres a dude on the phone another smoking a joint out back and another guy taking a dab out back (either that or he was running a propane torch for no reason.)

Its not my actual job title, but in essence I'm a janitor. I kind of wear a lot of hats but 90% of the time im cleaning and moving heavy things. I have to have a modicum of professionalism (i.e. I can't use the word fuck around some account holders.) Not one of them was like ""hey be with you in a minute."" Like I'm pretty easy breezy but fuck customer service is lacking. Whatever I'm here for the oil. So I wait for them all to be done. Guy out back finished his joint comes in checks my email med card and then sells me a gram of badder, and a banger (old one broke).

So for one thing there were no THC percentages on the oil nor did they name any strains. It was tiered on consistancy. Shatter/badder/crumble/diamonds/washed diamonds.(tbf a lot of the people just run trim or a collection of good nugs for the higher quality oil so its not just one strain) Dude gets done doing a dab and then starts hitting a chillum in front of the ""no consuming Marijuana on the premises"" sign trys talking to me about the weather while im making this transaction. Theres a buy one get one free on the shatter.

Imagine going to pick up your Ritalin and the pharmacist, who just got done eating some pills, offers you another bottle for free....actually that would be an improvement. 

I wouldn't care so much if so many people in the industry weren't such self righteous pricks. I dont know about these guys specifically but I was fairly close with a guy who makes oil and sells to local dispensaries and some friends. He calls the people he sells to ""patients."" The mothafucka has a bachelors in archeology, his partner is an apprentice electrician. They aren't ""doctors"" in any sense of the word.
One of his ""patients"" needed to switch THC enemas, which he didn't know how to make or buy because he has elementary knowledge of anatomy and not really any pharmacology...you know some of the shit you need to know to make and dispense medicine. So he takes it to facebook asking if anyone can help his ""patient"" out.

Just fucking make it legal. Have a restorative justice bill where everyone who was imprisoned for smoking weed gets released with a quap and bunch of blunts. Sell to out of states and make real money, and have actual doctors perscribe specialized treatments and have pharmacies dispense actual medicinal quality weed and weed products so that people who need niche things like enemas can actually get it.

Weed is great and definitely has a ton of medicinal potential, but I want it to be studied by scientists and doctors and chemists... not my buddy Clyde who sucks down 5gs of oil a day.

The interesting thing comes now, because he said that he tried lsd and got really addicted to it, taking it everyday in very large doses (4 tabs everyday he said), for several weeks. From all I know that's impossible, because tolerance builds up so fast you'd have to double your dose each time you take it to experience an effect the next day. He also said he got very addicted to heroin later, which I do believe is possible. Later we had an argument if drugs (especially cannabis), should be legalized. I obvioisly said yes to that and told him all the arguments that everyone human being with a brain knows. If you wanna smoke weed you can do it anyways also if you're 14 like me. I myself know that it's easier for me to buy weed than buying vodka for example which is a regulated and legal drug. Then there's the fact that most cannabis consumers aren't actually addicts and just wanna enjoy themselves a little but we all know that and many more good arguments for a legalization. Then he responded ""that most people who consume cannabis start with it underaged so there's no point of legalizing it"". How fucking retarded is that?!

I’ve had some shit on my mind and wanted to see what others thought or if anyone else has dealt with this. I’ve been using drugs over the last few years. I don’t think I’m doing anything wrong. It started as minor curiosity and turned into a hobby that has added a lot to my life. But lately I’ve been feeling a lot of shame associated with my drug use, specifically when it comes up in conversation with non users. I am really bothered by the idea of what others might assume about me because of my drug use. 

I smoke weed daily for both medicinal and recreational purposes, admittedly more than I probably should. I take small hits off my vape pen throughout the day at work, then smoke flower to get high each night. It helps me with my insomnia and stimulates my appetite which is something I’ve struggled with in the past. Weed has also helped me get off of my prescription antidepressants. I’ve been smoking for a little over 3 years but I refuse to allow my family to know that I do it. Only a handful of my friends know I smoke, but I only feel comfortable telling them if I know they also smoke. 

Around late December I tried shrooms for the first time and was blown away. I had a very fun trip and also discovered wonderful insights about life. I’ve developed healthy eating habits, started working out, been more uplifted overall, started reading more books and working on more creative projects. This one psychedelic experience turned my life around and made me want to try more. 

I bought some acid from a co worker yesterday. I haven’t done it yet. I’m waiting until I have a few days off in a row. I also have plans to get more shrooms. I want to continue experimenting with psychedelics, since I loved the experience so much. 

But that feeling that I’m ruining my life or doing something wrong is so persistent when I’m talking to people about it. My roommate made a small comment yesterday about me “trying all the drugs now” and it hurt more than it should have. I practice harm reduction and read extensively before taking any new substance. I have other hobbies in my life besides drugs. I have a stable job that I excel in. I still hold relationships with my friends and family, they just don’t know I use drugs. Do I need to tell them? Should I stop feeling ashamed and shout it from the rooftops? Or is it okay to keep some hobbies more private?  Does anyone else deal with internalized stigma and if so how do you fight it? 

Sorry for the long post. I really appreciate anything anyone has to say on the topic!

We're at his mom's place, who decided to invite her hippie friends over for some sort of naked swim party. There were only a few of them.

At one point my BF wanted to take the trash out so he went. I was listening to some pink Floyd and noticed after 15 min he was gone for a long time. I went to look for him in the house and he wasn't in there. I went outside the house to search around the perimeter, worried he was tripping too hard or some shit. Then all the sudden this border patrol officer comes running from the pool, dick and balls slappin against his legs. I gasped cuz I was so surprised and he ran into some bedroom. I was FUCKING freaked cuz I was trippin balls (no pun intended) and looked for my BF some more.

I returned to our guest room and found him sitting at his desk. I laughed so hard and began to tell him about the officer, and he started BALLING. I was so concerned.

He then started going into some sort of psychosis. He thought there was some ""joke being played on him"" and kept whispering to himself. ""What do you want me to say. That I was a thumb sucker?""

I was so confused, I tried to get him to snap out of it. ""Babe you're tripping hard."" he was like, let me talk to my mom. I was like no dude, her hippie friends are over and you're babbling like a crazy dude. I was trying to keep him calm and he kept laughing hysterically and then crying. It was extremely frightening, and he kept looking at me very strangely and saying shit about his childhood in very quiet whispers.

I had him lay on me and just held him because of his extreme emotional nostalgia (which I didn't understand at all at that point what was going on in his head) and he then looked at me and said ""ARE YOU WEARING MAKEUP?"" And was like??? no??? and he said ""you're my mom"" and shit like that.

Anyway this went on for the entire peak, and when he finally came out of it after 3 hours he told me he felt like his mom and I and the hippies were playing a joke on him, recreating scenes from his childhood and teasing him (this was literally all created in his head from tripping so hard).

This ties back to the officer because when he dashed into the bedroom I told you about, my boyfriend was apparently in there CRYING because he thought the room looked exactly like his childhood room, and that's what had set off the whole ""joke"" he thought was played on him. He thought his mom and me were pretending he was a little baby again and that I was impersonating his mom.

I don't have this problem with other psychedelics

--

Hey all. I'm fairly new to psychedelics. I was given DMT without being told what it was as a ""prank"" when I was 16. As you can imagine, it was a rough time and left me scared to try hallucinogens of any kind until this year (at 24 y/o), when my boyfriend finally made me feel secure enough to dive in. 

I've done LSD a good handful of times now and love it. I always have a fun, positive high. I've done shrooms twice and had one good experience and one anxious one, but I think I prefer LSD anyways.

Before I tried the LSD and shrooms, I faced my DMT fears for the first time and freebased some old stuff with my bf that he had laying around. This was in January. That batch/quantity/method didn't do a whole lot for me besides make me feel heavy and lethargic.

Last month we picked up a new pen. While I was on LSD and having a very good, fun high, I decided to lightly puff on the DMT pen intermittently through my trip. It made the visuals a lot more interesting/intense, and extended my trip, but absolutely destroyed my mood. I got really really depressed and couldn't shake it, but my bf and I had been arguing that week so I thought maybe it was just playing off that. I stayed depressed a few days after.

2 nights ago I tried the same thing. During a very fun high, I took light puffs of the pen throughout my trip. Everything in my life has been great the past few weeks so I was expecting to be fine, but again my mood instantly worsened and I got very depressed, anxious, and suicidal. I'm still trying to shake the lingering bad feelings.

Everything I've seen and heard about DMT says it's supposed to be a positive experience and help people work through their problems. I can't seem to find anything about it making people this sad. 

Is it just not supposed to be taken with LSD and I'm misinformed about interactions? Were we possibly given a research chem?

This is the 3rd time I’ve stopped smoking for more than 3 days since I was a kid, so I don’t have a lot of dreams. I’ve been sober quite a while now. 

Last night I had a very detailed dream where I was walking along a highway that slowly turned into a plain white floor with very high plain white walls towering over me but I just kept walking like I knew where I was going. 

I reached the end and it was a large plain white wall that would be a dead end if not for the normal door sized hole, when I walk through I’m in a pitch black room with a small hole in the floor covered by boards with light peeking through.

As this is the only way forward I move the boards but I can hear voices and I get scared, so I peek my head into the well lit room and it’s a normal living room type area but everything is huge compared to me like I’m an ant, suddenly a human who is also giant compared to me sees my head and rushed toward me. 

I’m obviously scared of this giant person and jump back into the pitch black room and then go back out to the white highway, now there’s vines growing on the wall that weren’t there before, I climb out and wake up. 

When I woke up I was filled with nostalgia because I hadn’t thought about this dream since I was a kid but now that I’d been reminded I remembered having it all the time, always slightly different but the white highway and pitch black room with a hole in the floor are always there.

Writing this as a form of catharsis

Just took 2mg of klonopin and I decided to write this while I wait for it to kick in. Don't really know where to start, I guess with my history of drug use? It's not very extensive honestly, I started drinking around 14, and I fucking loved it. Me and my friends would sneak off campus during lunch and drink beer. Then I would go back to school drunk and try to function, most people never really found out because I only got a little tipsy, I had some self control knowing I had to go back to school. I never really got to the point of alcoholism, but I did start drinking a lot more outside of school hours. I could never have 1 beer if I was with friends. Always 3 or 4, then a shot, then another beer... you get the picture. I couldn't stop, my brain always just went ""MORE MORE MORE"" I loved the way it made me feel. I've been suicidal and depressed since I was 13 and alcohol just gave me that warm fuzzy feeling and made me feel like everything was alright for a bit. Eventually I was introduced to cannabis and that was pretty fun but I only did it a few times before I was convicted of a felony and put on probation, which mostly stopped me from smoking weed for  a year because I was being randomly drug tested. Once I was off probation I started smoking occasionally again.  I've also done painkillers a few times and I did acid once. 

I don't know if I was raised in an abusive household but it was definitely chaotic and unstable. My dad was in the Army so we moved around a lot, on top of that he was special forces which means he was deploying every 6 months and constantly training when he was home. I didn't see him much but when I did, he was always either yelling or just completely emotionally shut off. It was impossible to form a relationship with him, it was like having a stranger living in your house, a stranger that liked to occasionally hit you and verbally berate your mother. My mom was extremely depressed for most of my childhood and couldn't really be there for us. She was like a calmer version of my dad. Didn't hit us as much, and had periods of time where she was nice. I never learned how to form relationships with people, like I had friends, but I never got close to them because I would move 3000 miles away before I could get close, and any romantic relationship I had was usually just for sex. I literally do not know how to be close with people, I never learned. I'm so alone.

As I said before, I've been suicidal since I was 13 and I started self harming at that age too. I got diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder at 16 and in those 3 years since I've been on 7 medications and lots of therapy. None of it got rid of the depression or suicidal thoughts or dissociation. I want to die so fucking badly I've given up. That's where the drugs come into play. I bought 5mg of Xanax a few days ago and I went through that in about 24 hours. I picked up 10mg kpin last night and did not stop thinking about it until I got home from work. It makes me feel so calm and happy like nothing matters.  I know I can't have a physical dependance yet but that mental piece kicked in quick lol. I wanted to document this path I'm going down and reddit seemed like a good place to do it.

Hi guys, this is my first post here. The rules seem to allow me to post this question and I have no idea where else to ask as Google hasn't seemed to be helpful. Please let me know if this isn't an appropriate place to ask.

Anyway, I went camping this week and smoked weed, drank and took MDMA. On the first evening I was very careful and split a Tesla pill into thirds and one. Other people there took a full pill as they take it more regularly.

I should say - before this week I have only taken MDMA a couple times and never found the astral planes that everyone else seems to find. 

So I took a third and did a line of it too and felt almost nothing.

Over the week I increased the dosage and took a full pill + a line and I barely felt anything, only as slight buzz and an increased enjoyment of sensations. But my friends were off their tits on half what I took

The final evening I took... A lot. My friend made me 2 bombs over a few hours that he said was about 7× what he would give anyone else. Plus about twice a normal line. That was about the only time I felt anywhere near what I imagine everyone else was

I know the effect of MDMA is altered by the digestive system and (TMI) i hadn't pooped in a week (I can't go in strange places), could that have effected it?

I smoke weed every day too.. could that alter my tolerance?

I also had antidepressants when I was a teenager and I wondered if the effect on the seretonin reuptake could still effect it (it was around 4/5 years ago that I was last on them.

I've studied toxicology before so any biochemical explanations are welcome.

This is gonna be a long post and isn't a super high dose crazy DPH/DXM/6 tabs of acid trip report, just a dumb story that came about completely unintentionally.

Okay so first things first lets set the seen. 

It's december 2014 and i am 17yrs old, i have recently entered my first proper relationship with a girl that am very much enamored by and we have just arranged for me to meet her parents for the first time (her very strict, very traditional, religious parents) and i want to make a good impression.

I'm nervous about whole situation as i'm pretty hard into my emo phase at this point so i don't exactly fit the standard example of what a traditional family might want for their daughter.

So my girlfriend lives in a very isolated village 5 or 6 miles outside of my town, the kind of place public transport doesn't even go to. The only way to get there is to take a bus to another village a few miles away and walk through country roads for a few miles to my girlfriends village.

Anyway it comes to the big night and i am getting ready to leave to meet her parents. (i'm catching the bus to the first village where my girlfriend will meet me and we'll walk through the country lanes together to get to her house).

Just as i'm about to leave to catch the bus my mum gives me a pack of kwells travel sickness pills (i had been complaining of travel sickness on busses for weeks and my mum just happened to pick these up on this day in particular). I thank her, give her a kiss on the cheek and take a pill as i walk to the bus stop. 

What i only found out recently is that these pills are pure scopolamine hydrobromide which explains the following.

I'm sitting on bus with my headphones in feeling pretty chill, i'm still nervous about meet the parents but my travel sickness isn't bothering me at all. I do feel pretty thirsty though and can't believe how hot the bus is considering it's december, i take my hoodie off because i'm actually sweating now.

I get off the bus and my girlfriend is wait at the bus stop, i guess i looked like i'd just shat myself and tried to put it back in because she looked pretty shocked to see me the way i appeared (pale, sweaty, red eyes and looking like an alzheimer's patient trying to figure out if he's sitting down lunch or storming the beaches in the battle of normandy)

I remember thinking i'd got off the bus at the wrong stop even though my girlfriend was there. She reassures me and i kinda shake it off a space out moment. We start walking down the country lanes towards her house. From this point on things get a little fuzzy.

I remember walking down the road thinking (it's pitch black btw) and see street lights of roads in the distance and just making a b-line towards them because ""the lights are so pretty"" i was 5'11 and weighted 180lbs which was alot more than my 5'3 girlfriend so it most of been pretty rough for her to drag me out of the road 20 times as i kept trying to get to these lights. I took my shirt of at one point so i could ""feel the wind on my skin"".

This walk took us an hour and 20 minutes but i only remember 10 minutes at most. We arrive at the house i meet the parents, my girlfriend looks super humiliated, they look horrified at what their daughter brought into their home and they put me on a couch where i fall asleep for 5 hours and wake up to my girlfriend telling my i should probably go because her parents are going to bed and i kinda fucked it

We broke up within a few weeks.

An active gastritis flare up is not a nice experience - nausea, vomiting, fatigue, indigestion, just feeling shit and pain for days are the consequences of eating trigger foods, like spicy and caffeine. My gastritis is in remission right now, but I manage my diet and lifestyle to keep it at bay. Which is the same for everyone with chronic gastritis.

prior to taking vyvanse i was on depakote and seroquel for bipolar II disorder. so since it had been a few months that i was on these meds, i asked my psychiatrist if we could try something for my adhd.

now i'm not gonna lie. i want to try and be as honest as possible. we're just strangers on the internet so i'm a little more comfortable with being honest.

i had taken stimulants before. well only adderall. i liked it, but it wasn't something that i did often. sometimes i would swipe a few from my mom though.

anyways, me, being a little shit, thought it would be cool if i managed to get some prescribed. i mean, i did need them, but i knew that taking stimulants was not going to be good combined with my bipolar disorder. honestly i didn't care about that outcome, because in reality my meds weren't doing shit for me. seroquel sedates the fuck out of me and depakote, honestly, worked. but i was really self-destructive. like i'm thinking about it now and i was actually fucking crazy. and i didn't care what happened to me or how it would effect me.

so i went through with it. if my psychiatrist was willing to do it, then fuck it. 

i'm a fucking idiot i know...

at first i got prescribed strattera. it really didn't do shit for me. our next visit i tell him, he ups my dosage, still doesn't really do much. he prescribes me methylphenidate. there was a side effect it caused, but i honestly don't remember. he then prescribed me vyvanse.

at that point i had thought he was gonna prescribe me adderall since he said there was only one other drug to try. but he suggested vyvanse. i didn't know shit about it, but my brother used to get it prescribed to him when he was younger. and i learned it was actually one of the best drugs for adhd since it was basically adderall but without the terrible effects. 

i was sold, not that i had another choice either way but i was excited to try it.

i liked it, a lot. it made school so much easier, granted me the confidence i wanted, and made me feel better about everyday life. it was actually a really good experience at first.

i was only taking it on schooldays at first, but then i started taking it whenever anything needed to get done. then i started taking it anytime i needed motivation to do literally anything. which turned into taking it daily. 

i'm not sure how long it took to get to that point.

but overtime i started skipping out on meals and losing weight. i started to look slimmer and people were even noticing. which made me happy, even though it was very unhealthy.

i really liked this effect the drug had on me. i thought if i took advantage and lost enough weight i would be happy with myself. i don't know why, but i've always had a problem with my body image. this is a serious problem of mine that i'm starting to realize is very damaging.

anyways so, i went to only eating once a day to sometimes not even eating. i barely eat now. i can actually go a very long time without eating.

i now weigh 168.

i don't feel good. i take vyvanse to give me the energy to go about my day. it zombifies me and it makes it hard for me to interact with my family or coworkers. i'm never hungry. i feel shitty when i'm not on it and usually stay in my room all day.

it was not worth it.

so yeah. i'm stoned and it took me like 2 hours to write this and i kind of forgot its purpose but i didn't waste 2 hours to not post this shit so.

Still very curious about what I took that night. A friend of mine took “acid” once too and he said he had the exact same effects as me. He knew what LSD was alike cause he took 1P-LSD a couple times before he tried the “real acid”. His friends he did it with got busted, drug tested and he said they were positive on methamphetamine.)


Me and a dude I know for about a year now were talking about different kinda drugs at one of our smoke sessions and we started talking about acid. I told him I was interested in trying it and he told me that he could get me some.

A couple days ago I finally got 1 ""acid"" tab he told me had 180ug so on the same day I cut a tiny bit of it like a quarter and took it. Didn't feel anything tbh except placebo effects I guess.

Yesterday I took the rest of the tab, mathematically that would be 135ug. Within the first hour I realised I was getting a little angry and I really wanted to do something. I was getting really energetic and went downstairs in my basement to exercise a ""bit"". A little sidenote I'm not really athletic I'm 1,80m and about 70kg. I started running and had my phone with me. I was running for about 30 minutes and then exersiced with some weights and stuff for another 40 minutes. I went upstairs into my room and started playing CS:GO for about 1 hour. About 2 and a half hours passed by now and I had no optics or visual changes. Everything I looked at seemed normal I was just very energetic and I also felt very euphoric. In fact I couldn't stop smiling at all and I had a good feeling everywhere in my body. I was playing CS:GO until maybe 1am and then I went to ""sleep"".

I was in my bed, and really tried to get some sleep... but I couldn't. I was wide awake until 6am in the morning, and then somehow fell asleep and slept until 11am. On the next day I just didn't feel anything. Some people told me that on the next day of taking acid they felt really exhausted but I didn't feel exhausted at all.

If someone can tell me by the effects and experience I just told you what the hell I took I'd be very thankful.

A 2020 study revealed a new way to trick your brain. by using known receptors on the blood brain barrier, and a transport vehicle, drugs can be transported more easily into the brain. While previously it was common to do this indirectly as you may have experienced yourself. 

This still needs further research, but the first results are promising and will pave the way to more effective drugs directly for the brain. This may help in the treatment of several diseases, or in the use of recreational drugs.

I’m an 18-year old college student for obvious reasons the idea of developing a dependence on a strong substance at this point in my life definitely worries me, therefore I’d rather not even try anything that might possibly lead me down that route.  Nevertheless I can’t deny I am definitely looking forward to doing something a bit heavier in a few decades, especially after having seen so many of my friends have a kickass time on MDMA and ketamine.

However lately I’ve come across a few opinions and forums that made me think my expectations are way too high. Mainly because I’m already on antidepressants that I’ve seen described as “similar to cocaine”. I‘m on Zoloft 200mg and Wellbutrin 150mg and I’d say most weeks I smoke weed 1-3 times and have a few piss ups every month and I definitely don’t get any sort of “intense breath-taking euphoria” while high or drunk despite being on psychiatric meds. I know these drugs affect everyone differently and so do different marijuana strains but still it kinda bothers me that maybe I’ve already been “the most fucked up” I’ll ever be if that makes sense. I have a really high tolerance to weed because I’ve been smoking for 4 years now and I really don’t get anything else but a sense of pleasant relaxation from it. Even when mixing it with alcohol sure it’s a cool buzz and it‘s a lot of fun but it’s not like I’m overflowing in dopamine to the point I even struggle to eat. So my question is albeit you can only provide anecdotal evidence, would you say I could get an even stronger feeling of happiness from any substance than that from alcohol + weed + antidepressants? And how much more potent can it get?

It’s not like it’s the end of the world if I never get to feel pure bliss from snorting some gear, I have pently to live for other than awaiting getting smashed as an elder, but it’s just something I’d like to know.

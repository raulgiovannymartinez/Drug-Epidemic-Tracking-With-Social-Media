I go to sit on the couch and then suddenly I'm im in the garage punching the air, like having a full blown boxing match with the fucking air. Pictures on the wall begin to jump out at me, I suddenly am standing in front of an old abandoned castle, 3 shadow people are leading me in, they were whispering to each other, but they never looked or spook to me, Once I'm in the dark castle I wake up on the kitchen floor. My dog comes up to me I pet him and he vanishes. I was on my phone watching youtube, I kept scrolling but it wouldn't move, only to realize I never had my phone with me this happened several times. Spiders are everywhere now, I'm extremely paranoid, but I'm too tired to run from them, I hallucinate water bottles I try to grab them my hands go through air. My dog comes up to me I pet him he disapears, I can't take it anymore, whenever my hair brushed my skin it would send me into a full blown panic, I forced myself to sleep as voices taunt and laugh me, I wake up feeling foggy and out of it, and because of this trip my deppression seemed to get worse, don't fuck with this drug ever use it for what it's intended for,

I've been taking DPH (zzzquil) to compensate for the lack of escape options(relatively 1 dose a day). It helps with anxiety and I can buy it at any store, although I do not prefer being dependent on this drug at all. I read up on so many psychedelic stories and have dreams(have had 3 so far) that I'm tripping on acid. It's amazing I just wish it were real. It's like I have such an intense desire/longing for this drug, I think about it every day. Overall, my current state of mind towards this is that I am very eager and feel positive that by the time I do get to trip, I will be ready.

Pisces live in two worlds, the real world and the spiritual or mystical world where they interpret what they see into what they want. They do this to avoid all the realities of pain and suffering in the world. They have extremes of emotions and feel both good and bad intensively. Pisces have formidable intuitive ability. Most Pisces are somehow involved with occult or spiritualism. Pisces are very good at understanding people for they have the ability to delve into the psyche and see behind a person’s motivations.

Pisces are prone to drug addiction and indulging lifestyles because of their eternal search for themselves and their fear of confrontation and having to change a situation, also they justify drug use by allowing it to get closer with their ‘spiritual selves’. Once they aware this is why they are doing it, it will be easier to kick the habit. Pisces are not the pushovers that they may seem, in fact they have strength of character and will stand up for what they believe in and and they can do hard work for something they believe in. They can be very lazy but only in matters that they do not care about. Pisces is the most sensitive of all zodiac signs and is noted for its depth of feeling, compassionate nature, and shy sweetness..

The Pisces personality is hard to pin down, it is very mysterious and elusive. Pisces are molded by their surroundings, they incorporate their experiences and surroundings into themselves. They have extreme compassion and they feel the pain of others. If something is wrong in the world that affects them, it affects them deeply, they take it to heart and feel extreme feelings regarding the matter.

Used up the rest of my clear few weeks ago, didn't re-up, only used a few times with my friend in that time frame. Started running again, exercising, taking a free online course, doing well at work, *not drinking much.....*  


Until I did really drink last weekend. No reason other than the sole purpose of wanting to drink, as alcoholics do. Well that turned into an array of text messages to someone I should not have been messaging whatsoever. As intoxication increased, so did my frustration. Eventually leading to a short and sweet messaging fiasco with said someone's SO, where I more or less went off about everything and attempted to set up a brief meetup to settle things. They declined (maturely so), as I had no business going anywhere in that condition. Not going to lie, I was a little bummed. Of course after all had been said and done, I was completely blocked from everywhere by my ex-friend (which should have happened months ago even before a SO was in the picture, but that's another story).  


Even though this ex-friend and I were on full non-communication terms even before the incident, they were still present on a couple medias, as well as not blocked. I don't know why this was exactly, but at the very least it was something. It's a very complicated situation that took root over the past year, to say the least. This incident threw me right back into all those old ways of thought I work so hard to manage. I wrote all sorts of messed up BS on my FB, passed out till Monday. Re-upped clear, even more this time. So I spent the entire week pretty much hitting it as hard as I felt comfortable doing. One sleepless night, two, then some rest on the third, and a few more hours through Friday. Ended up with about 10hrs of sleep M - F. Got a nice 10hrs of sleep Friday, felt unreal, like a new person.  


But now we're beginning to realize the consequences of our actions. Emotions are fucked, depression like nothing else. Thoughts going to all the wrong places, at all the wrong times. Normal doses hardly scratch the surface, little more than the initial rush, with maybe an hour or two of some small effect. Of course I could use more in a single dose, but I guess not doing that is my last attempt at not trying to go completely off the rails (pun). Gaining tolerance that fast is a little concerning, and frustrating. I haven't drank at all since, like usual when using. This is just some whole other type of problems compared with alcohol. At the end of the day, both are equal in their ability to ruin, just in different ways. I know I have to stop, I'm not at any withdrawal points or anything like that, but I know how I am, and if it's nearby, there's always a risk. I'm considering giving the rest to my friend, and go back to infrequent use until I can be done with it.

I’m worried I was about to have a borderline psychotic episode. I know pretty much nobody here is a medical professional, but I want to see if these symptoms are at least found in some other users here. I’ve smoked pot and done edibles many many times, but not consistently. This was the first time I’ve freaked out this much.

During the come-up, I tried to keep myself grounded like I was taking a trip, talking to myself saying “this will pass, don’t worry it’s only temporary”. All my anxieties were multiplied tenfold, almost overwhelming. The part that freaked me out was that I could pretty much see each and every one of them. Now ‘see’ is not the best way to describe it, so let me clarify. It was like an extremely vivid mental picture, so much so I believed what I was picturing in my head was real life, and had to snap out of it to stop imagining those scenarios and such. Kind of like investing yourself into watching a movie only to realize ‘wait I can just look away and not see that anymore’. I was paranoid, thought people were behind me and could ‘feel’ their presence, only to turn around and have reality smack me in the face and realize there’s really nobody there. I’ve done salvia many times and the high took on a slightly salviatic feeling in the sense of body load. I think at this dosage of THC, past psychedelic use has ruined the experience of being that stoned for me.

In retrospect I never took enough to ""work"" or I took entirely too much and it was bizarre 

But one time he gave me shilajiit and gotu kola for some reason. I wasn't sure which plant was having this effect on me but I believe it to be the shilajiit. Certainly psychoactive. Nice preseason tingles all throughout mt body, extremely noticeable ones. Almost an electric energy to it.

I don't quite know how to describe the situation I'm feeling, and I really have no one else to talk to about this that can relate. I apologize ahead of time for the formatting, I don't quite know *what* I'm feeling, so its a little difficult to describe *how* I'm feeling.   


There is a part of my mind, deep in my subconscious, it is not something I can control, it is not something I can reason, it is only something I can feel. I can only put it as purely as that. But...the mind is a cage, in many aspects. I think back, to my drug filled days. Life just..flowed, and I with it. Things just happened, and I was simply a witness to them. I felt life...I don’t quite know how else to explain it. I look at the trees, the blue sky, the birds and the bees, and it feels different. Sober, that is a tree, oxygen providing, chlorophilled leaves, water, nutrients, etc. The sky is blue, the absorbance of light, angles of refraction. But, not sober. I feel...the beauty of the color blue, it radiants across the entire sky, never ending, all filling. The bold rich green color of the leaves, radiating, flowing in the wind, rustling. There is no other way to describe it outside of...I feel it. I feel it all, I feel the rustling of the leaves, the chirping of the bird, the color in the sky. I feel...free. No responsibilities, no thoughts, no ideas, just flowing with all that is happening around me, from the tiny ant that crawls, to the luminous sun shining its rays across my existence.   


These...moments, they are not just memories. They are that, moments. They are triggered, by random things, and in those moments, I cannot control it. I feel that moment, I feel those feelings. I feel, for just a brief moment, free. The moment passes in the blink of an eye, and almost like the come down from a hard trip, my elation turns to depression. I feel...down. I really don't know what it is, or what I even feel. It's a very bizarre random feeling, and it is not something I can *choose* to feel. I just feel...awe, amazement, innocence, wonder? It is a conglomeration of these feelings, all mixed together. I'd also say, there might even be a feeling of...longing mixed in with all that.   


I have been sober for over 8 years, nothing outside of a few beers here and there. My prior use was a lot of weed, mixed in with psychodelics and a sprinkle of amphetamines. These episodes are random, and infrequent, but their strength has not waned throughout the years, nor has their frequency. I have completely changed my life around 180 in these past 8 years, thus, I really don't have anyone that could even remoltely relate/understand the above. I'm honestly just looking for an explanation...what is this? what am I feeling? why? how do I stop it?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,693352,public,confidence,self,Strange...flashback moments I feel triggered by sometimes random stuff,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hq2yvo/strangeflashback_moments_i_feel_triggered_by/,no_ads,0.0,1594619943.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read before u do it PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE

So about 6 months ago now I bought some tabs which I thought were acid and turned out to be NBOME and retardedly me and the person i was doing them with did them together regardless and didn’t spit them out,
 We waited about 2 hours for a come up and that’s when it hit we felt sick unsure if we were hungry or on the verge of puking everywhere the visuals were cool but not insane everything looked as if it had life and was breathing and buildings were bouncing about i also had no perception of angles and everything felt curved around a point 

we then went inside and chilled in her bed played rdr2 and start shaking uncontrollably we couldn’t tell if we were too hot or too cold so we removed the blanket that’s when we both felt like we were truly gonna kick the bucket but luckily we survived that bit and just held eachother then left the house to find everything to have a slight dark purple hint to it and the curving had kinda settled down a bit and from there on i don’t remember much i went home had dinner and fell asleep only to wake up the next day feeling nothing but confusion on why i did what i did 



1 month later.....
i’m depressed very depressed and i can barely look at people and smile life sucks and stress is high with exams creeping up on me 

3 months later....
losing and gaining feelings for so many people it feels toxic broke up with my gf and talked to another girl and then fucked off that girl to get back with my gf to fuck off my friends to gain new ones..fuck knows what’s going on

6 months later 
now use weed and use it to cope with the occasional phases of depression i go through. 
i’m at a calm point but i still suffer from what nbome did to me 

PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS DRUG IF ITS BITTER ITS A SPITTER PLEASE PLEASE LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT TELL YOU THAT

...... i also may note my friend after that became extremely delusional and i can’t speak to him anymore because he just changed.....

the adderall and an hour later having a margarita .. ate a good meal steak carnitas and crab nachos with chicken and all the normal fixins 

I did have Jose cuervo silver through out the night mixed with cranberry juice and plenty of water, also a couple peaches 

that morning I woke up. having for probably one of the first times ever , fallen asleep randomly watching a movie and taking a break from writing my wanna be TV show. 
Cabin in the woods was playing in the background 
and toward the beginning when I was sitting there stretching my starting to ache from going pretty hard with the pencil hand , I just wake up 6 or 7 hours later ..
Never had a hangover like this , that just kept getting worse 

I couldnt shake it .. couldnt keep down anything ,nothing at all, water , peaches , bananas 

I didnt even try for 2to3 hours after awaking 
the shower was my new home 
i threw up in between showers in the toilet , and it was more than i ever have 
the amount , the duration .. unprecedented for me 

the showers multiple times turned into me not having the strength to leave it and just trying to move my face and mouth away from the shower water 
I kept dry heaving and then puking and kept feeling like I might drown- not just a little , but I kept going for air and the way the hotel shower tub is made it was hard to not breathe in water

this was vacation, and I have thrown up when I was younger, I'm 23 now and this was something that I've never heard of 

my knees would randomly get so weak I'd stop them from buckling 
dizzieness when entering the bathroom, a weird thing happening with my vision on and off ..
me nearly fainting from making certain movements..
the amount of water I always drink has pretty much prevented me from ever being hungover with headaches , and I did the same this time , 
Hydration , and even would eat fruit like pineapple with each drink , Or mix juice with it .
but this headache would build, and almost vanish , then Pulsate and build and start causing reactions in other areas that is fucking a feeling of death 
knocking at the door 

I' havent ever gone to anyone for help for almost anything 
im not one to worry 
but the pain I felt through out , 
the vomiting that me being able to stick a finger in my mouth just to see if theres more , and for the first time ever my gag reflex actually making me puke .. 

the inability to even drink water without puking it up 

my friend was leaving to go get some shit from his grandmas who lives where we were staying ,and I planned on not participating- due to my worries 
I would be unable to contain myself 
when his grandma brought down his belongings which included his much needed paper work , 
which in the same drawer of important paper work , waz his pocket pussy, well 

pocket anus 
well 
ailien replica of an anus
anyway 
for the first time in honestly my entire prior life, i was going to go to the doctor ON my on will ; not for requirements for sports or work etc

I just wanted an iv tube , and some kind of look over with machines to make sure I didnt fucktardingly. make some kind of 
backwoods liver buster that somehow really worked my stomach like a petri dish and fucked my new ovaries into pregnancy just for me to have fast forwarded whole conception Into self inflicted oral abortion

well long story longer I actually show up to an Urgent Care 
"" why are you here "" 
I tried talking and my voice was that cute thing peoples voice do it when they wake up 
except 
not cute , have been up for 6 hours or more, and it's from very loudly excercosming my redneck nuanced 4 loco my vacationed hyped up self created 
2 f.y.i's 
1. I've never been a quiet puker, I envy those who can hurl then twirl/ walk away
Loud , aggressive , sounds as if a bad actor is trying to fake puke and is pissed off the director is making him retake the scene 
2) I was great until the morning and even when I woke up it wasn't that bad but did build .. 
Its strange how the body that night decided hey , keep this shit in here all night, then , wake up and slowly begin shutting down , then 
even when you want to puke. we cant decide should we let it stay or kick it out 
but 
once you recognize puking is the option 
for the first time ever 
just will yourself to puke 
seriously 
go to the toilet after that first initial puke and from then on, should you muster the courage to try again,just go for it. 




the urgent care knew what I was there for , could hear my voice I'm meeeeh, and was aware it's been a long time with no water, no food , and lots of exciting symptoms 
asked for water , 1 minute later she comes back with 2 of those little letchup things McDonalds and golden corral uses for ketchup n gummies bears n shit.
2 ?? the generosity 

my insurance number kept getting entered in wrong EVEN after I call the oerson after me confirming multiple things numerous times with them 

the nurse I assume based on my keen observation, was a polite, professional.. doushe snuggle who after an hour and some change tells me my insurance number she called is now closed 

I call then again , theyre not .
process continues like this until eventually my insurance just isnt accepted ( my fault , I'm out of state and my insurance doesnt roll like that apparently)except for emergency rooms 

I leave into the hot sun thinking my friend wouldve schlepped out with his tail like pocket pussy between 
his somehow still untanned legs ( guy manages to live in florida , move back to corn state, then talk both way to highly and also way to much bad shit that apparently is good about florida , and yet never has a tan ' and no goddamn lie was whiter after his year ish florida stay , anywhomb)

I wait outside, and my hangover Plus Gets some much needed Sun, walking, and close to dying phone 

here the moral of the story 

will continue adding new things to my banned list which now included ( alchahol )
Bombay, 4 locos, cracken , and now my prior favorite 100 percent blue agave tequila ( only that Brand )

not the liquors fault BUT even though until thay night I had cut back on energy drinks 
having those drinks an hour+after adderall never 


this had extraz

Then later one pacing self with half redline then finishing the rest later 
never did a thing to me . 
folks
DONT drink alchahol with adderall.
You take it after and it slowly takes away your drunkenness in a way that's fucking you up on the inside ,
you drink after you take it and you just dont feel the effects WHICH if you're like me , you just wanna coast with at most some tipsyness
( never have liked getting anything more than tipsy )
It just stops you from feeling the effects , AND to some , meh maybe you want that 
BUT everything you add to that mixture, 
can mesh with that combination and put its own little self important spin on it and eventually , you'll really regret it 
it takes me Once for almost anything- to stop and change . 
I will try almost anything twice ,
BUT only if I'm not genuinely worried it wouldn't end my existence 
Folks who are shitting and somehow still reading this 
do not , drink , after , adderall 
wanna impress your friends?
Put some non alchaholic liquor or beer in your personal bottle , the bottle obviously being a normal bottle in disguise 


HOWEVER 
redline, on a side note, is the best energy drink I've ever had - and like I said 
Those things were so much apart of my life for health reasons and wallet reasons , I had to stop.
BUT these , damn .. DaMNNn.
I will definitely have these as my little guilty pleasure 

That night before the hangover, I wrote more than I had in quiet sometime 
if your procrastinating with something, drink A redline and mix it with your prescription adhd meds. 
Be responsible and have some goddamn pasta before you do, or at least a fucking sandwich you animal
But 
know
the alchahol, did little to nothing for that and actually , fucked me over 
When you're in the fucking zone like you've never been in a while 
the atmosphere is right , comfy , etc. you know -Your- Zone ,
the last thing you want is the unfelt effects of that mediocre liquor to make you unknowingly pass right out and 
put a raging holt to the masterpiece ( masterpiece worthy for your taste )
and it then be out if commission for a day or more 
unable to finish what you started 


College kids , and others needing that special boost for writing , or creating with pencil or typeboard 
Your prescription ( or your overpriced friends you savage) with some whole grain carbs, and half a redline then the other half of said redline silly through the last parts of your night
trust me 
just 
do
not 
drink

How do you quit using a drug that seems to be improving your life in every possible way? Schoolwork? Enjoyable and amazing work quality. Social situations? Forget about it, I'm the life of the party!  Any skill I want to learn or improve at I take Adderall, spend days working on it and I'm better than the person that introduced me to it. The problem is that anything I have to do that requires cognitive ability and mental stamina, I think of no reason to not take Adderall to do it. I don't abuse it in the sense of taking very high doses or staying up multiple days, but for about a year now I have been taking what would essentially be prescribed doses 3-5 days a week (20-50 mg). The comedowns suck, but pretty much last a day max for me. The problem is finding no reason to not do it. I have a pretty heavy workload for school as I am Pre-Med, and my interests are music, sports, poker, and less now because of time constraints but competitive gaming. It makes me better at EVERY single one of those things.

I would appreciate if anyone in a similar situation could give any advice or a less addictive and harmful alternative.

بِسمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحمٰنِ الرَّحيم

Disclaimer: I am an idiot and I am proud of it. I am willing to take any criticism on the chin, if you do to, so we can both improve. I will try to phrase this from 3 angles so that everyone can understand. I come from a spiritual background so that will take precedence when I am explaining but I will include all other angles, if Allah wills.

**TLDR:** 

There is a metaphysical battle between Good (long-term, serotonin-releasing) and evil(short-term, dopamine-releasing).

The ultimate goal for Good is for you to recognise others divinity including yourself and work in co-operation.

The ultimate goal of Evil is to make you recognise your divinity and enslave others by it, a.k.a become your own only God.

Every human is born with the ability to become either good or bad(free choice).

But there are only a few architypes of Good/Bad which you can act like(predestination)

The way to become good/bad is to act like someone who is good or bad.

Most people want to be good but the only way it seems you can get women in this society is to adopt dark triad personality and physical appearance, (a.k.a become a psychopathic believe you are your own God.).

When you act like someone you embody their spirit. If you embody a good spirit you are said to be enlightened, if you embody a bad spirit you are said to be possessed.

Only reason the good side is better is because it allows a libertarian approach to everyone’s divinity rather than a zero-sum approach to peoples divinity.

I have miraculously recovered from both spiritual and drug-induced psychosis. At the same time!

If you read further I can concretely show how society today is a funnel towards drug use and “possession” by spirits and how the only way to escape is to believe in God, like I did.

Everything is a drug, pick your poison/medication and get worse/better.

**Drug 1: Islam**

Coming from an Islamic spiritual perspective, I am born into a practicing Muslim family. I prayed all 5 prayers a day consistently. I had 1/30 of the Quran memorised of by heart. I was told by my parents essentially that if I just stayed asleep and brainwashed by the religion I would have a perfect life. This induced a pseudo autistic mind state of bliss which we will from now on refer to as insect mode. Insect mode is essentially a blissful state of no anxiety. This lasted until I was 14 when my sexuality was awoken. I could now no longer bare to wait until after marriage to have sex. Insect mode no longer was there, I became so painfully aware of my insecurities, how the rest of the world viewed Muslims as asleep individuals sleepwalking through life and backward people. I decided I needed to awaken my shadow (from Jungian psychology) so that girls would find me attractive.

**Drug 2: Metaphysics**

I did not want to abandon the religion that gave me so much bliss in insect mode that I tried to control my sexual desires, which led to me researching monks and how they were celibate which led me to reading about Buddhism and chakras which led to Sufism aka Islamic mysticism. This had some success and I did no-fap hard mode for 120+ days which was a big achievement, but the problem of no sex until marriage was still there. Metaphysics gave me some bliss, but I was still aware of peoples perceptions of Islam.  I read imam Al-Ghazali’s books from a young age and Ibn Arabi’s books, and reading Rumi’s poems. I have tried and had partial success with several of these techniques for enlightenment, but it still wasn’t enough. I needed to become a “bad-boy”.

**Drug 3: Actual Drugs**

This was the only technique that actually got me some women, alcohol made me loose enough to have some confidence, and along with the perspective on life that cannabis provided I got my life in order started going to the gym and looking good, I became naturally more Machiavellian and thus more dark triad characteristics, and thus more attractive. I successfully lost my virginity and I thought the path to women was through drugs mixed with a bit of psychopathic shadow elements.

**Drug 4: Return of Spirituality**

I did a massive 0.6-gram dose of MDMA which was the best I’ve ever felt in my life. I thought if I can feel this good while on Earth, I imagined what heaven would be like. I began praying again and becoming a practicing muslim, but my brain had a chemical doorway opened to “land of the spirits”.  I call it the land of the memory circuits in your brain which resemble the architypes of the collective unconscious. I suddenly had the ability to communicate with “spirits/Modes of Being/Architypes”.

**Drug 4: Psychotic Episode which led to Benzodiazepine use.**

Due to the large MDMA I lost touch with reality to the point I was “possessed” (aka lost control over my unconscious) by “spirits”. I have a video of me which my mother took of me where I’m unable to move or communicate. I quickly recovered miraculously from this psychotic episode because I could navigate my way through the land of the spirits with Ibn Arabi’s book “Bezels of Wisdom” on following the circuits of being of the Prophets of Allah and in combination with medications. I followed the circuit of being which resembled prophet Muhammad peace be upon him, and I was able to escape the land of Insanity/Land of the Spirits. Acting like the prophet cured my spiritual psychosis while medication from doctors helped the physical side. The prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, was the doctor to our spiritual ailments, a.k.a mental problems, but we decided to act like “spirits” don’t exist.

The funny thing is that now I’m on a benzodiazepine in which I feel no anxiety, which is a bad copy of the peace that I was feeling in insect mode of Islam.

The Real TLDR:

Society is funnelling every male into becoming a psychopath so that we can have sex but this will cause mental problems, which the only way you can get out of them is by copying how the prophets acted and the last prophet to Earth was Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him. And some medication(maybe? Who knows?).

**But yall will only focus on the physical side and the cycle will continue**

just like attack on titan if you watched it

Netflix tried to release a show called messiah where they had someone to act like the antichrist, aka, embody his spirit, and people wonder why 2020 was such a crazy year??? I will expand in further posts about kabbala, the tree of life, all world religions, anime and some more In sha Allah

I (28F) have been taking drugs since I was 20ish, my range now includes MDMA, ecstasy, ketamine, speed, weed, and alcohol. I have never used excessively or abused, been pretty content with my use. Backstory: I used to suffer from an eating disorder and always thought my (to come) issues were related to that, Ive thought that gave me a weaker body and stomach but now im not sure anymore.. 

Back to main story: since I began taking drugs I noticed a pattern of me vomiting and feeling sick far more often than my friends. This has gotten increasingly frequent over the past 3 years, now it feels like almost everytime I take ecstacy or MDMA I feel sick and usually vomit too. 

Because of my eating disorder my teeth are pretty severely damaged and so I have this intense fear of throwing up - so now Im in a situation where (recovered from eating disorder) I feel extremely anxious before taking MDMA and ecstacy because I think I will feel sick and throw up. Successively I have started taking less and less, thinking that would help, I bring food to the club with me so I can eat right before dropping, I make sure to eat again (bread bun or banana or something) before redosing but I still just feel anxious, sick, and often vomit. Even if I dont vomit Im so stressed out about the possibility that I dont enjoy myself much. 

I think by now my anxiety is giving me half the stomach issues, by being so focused on it. 

After not having taken anything but ketmine for the past few months I went out last weekend and took MD, immediately I started feeling stressed out and sick, and in the end within like 30 minutes I feel like I am coming down (mentally), I feel disappointed, frustrated that I am stuck feeling this way, and sad that everyone else is getting their buzz on and having fun and Im just feeling sick. 

At this stage I feel so lost Im even starting to doubt that I enjoy taking drugs, but I think if I could just not get sick so often I could relax a bit and enjoy something that used to bring me a lot of happiness again. I used to love to go out and have fun and try different drugs and go to events.. 

I think a further part of the issue is that I am such a stressball in general, I am pretty uptight and afraid of losing control, and so once Ive dropped I feel so nervous to feel the full effects of the high, that I know deep down I do love it, so I take a quarter of a pill or something just to avoid feeling overwhelmed, which leaves me in this not high but just nauseous zone. 

I have considered quitting drugs altogether but then that feels like giving into my anxiety and throwing the towel in which feels quite sad to me. 

I guess what I am hoping for is some insight from people that have experienced similar thing, both on concrete tips and tricks on how to stop myself from vomiting or feeling nauseous, but also on the whole mentality around it, how to make it something fun and enjoyable, how to relax and not feel so worried.. by now my mind-frame has become so twisted and negative which really feels like a shame. 

Would be super grateful for any thoughts, advice, experiences you have to share!

I’ve been betting big on microdosing (and macrodosing mushrooms) the last year as I try to get off my SSRI. Microdosing helped me get from the highest dose to the lowest dose of Zoloft but the lower I go the harder things are getting and rebound depression is getting intense and debilitating at times. The effects of a macro dose are supposedly muted on the ssri so I haven’t given that much of a shot, and I haven’t microdosed more than twice a week in the past but when I dose I find a good 36 hours of positive therapeutic effect.

After all the reading I’ve done, I thought mushrooms were gonna be my way out of depression and SSRI dependence, but so far I haven’t had any longer term benefits from microdosing (possibly because I haven’t taken on a strict schedule)... I seem to return to the nasty depressed black hole after a few days. I ought to give the ‘microdosing on a *regular* basis’ a real try now that I have a very steady supply of mushies but very recently the opportunity to go for a ketamine treatment for the first time is immensely alluring from all the anecdotal and academic evidence for its efficacy. That and I have someone paying for the initial treatment for me. 

Microdosing mushies is way cheaper too obviously and I don’t really want to incur the cost of an extra $500 a month for booster sessions, that’s just highway robbery if I’m able to get similar effects from the mushrooms. The main advantage of the ketamine is its action on glutamate rather than serotinergic activation as it doesn’t get messed up with me still being on that last 25mg of Zoloft.

Any and all input is greatly appreciated!

So me and a couple of friends had bought tickets to a hardstyle rave party in our capital city, HeadHunterz was the main act for the evening. It was our first sort of rave we ever visited and for this special occasion we had booked ourselves a hotel room with breakfast included. We brought lots of beer and a few joints (only drug we consumed back then) to the hotel room and started drinking and get in the mood, went outside smoking a little from time to time. Time flew by, and we decided to take an Uber to the party, got in the que (it was an indoor party) and noticed we were way more drunk than we were supposed to be. We were in que for about 30 min and once we got in we really needed to go and take a leak. So me and one other friend went on and queing once again to go the the bathroom. Once it was our turn, a random guy behind us was like ""oh guys finally! Lets go to the toilet"" and we stood there like ""uhmm no its our turn"". He replied with ""no, we should REALLY go together"" and went on forcing his way through the door. We stood there wondering like wtf is this guy doing. He started peeing and told us he was very grateful that he could go with us cause he was going to piss himself, meanwhile we were almost in chock and thought he was just being drunk and yeah.. when he was done he asked us if we had ever tried ecstasy and we said no. He offered us a free pill to share and we first said no, he asked us if we were afraid for it being something else than ecstasy and we explained to him that we 1) had never tried anything like that before and 2) it came from a stranger 3) we were drunk. He replied by opening a whole bag of pills and small bags and shit, explained that he was ""The plug for this night"", we didnt really understand and he explained how it worked at these sort of parties. He then took two pills, broke them in halves, gave us one half each, said cheers and swallowed one of the other halves, and so did our drunk asses too. About 40 minutes later it kicks and holy shit we had a good time! The energy, the feelings, the atmosphere. Made lots of new friends that night and a memory for life.

Now, fast forward about three weeks.
I'm at a club in my hometown (about 1h from the capital city), dancing, talking, being social and drunk. A few hours in I see this guy, thinking ""Hoooly shit! It's that man who gave us the ecstasy a few weeks ago! I got to go and say hi and thank him for the wonderful experience.""  so I went to him and The conversation goes a little like this:
- Hi man, remember me? I want to thank you a lot for the super fucking fun night the other week!
- uuh, dude what are you talking about?
- it was me and a friends of mine who you gave the pills at the toilet after we let you in. You dont remeber?
- uhmm... I really think you're mistaking me for someone else.
- haha yeaah I'm sure.. come one man. Are you undercover now or something? I know its you but ok... well thank you alot, and please let me buy you a beer to repay the favour.

He looked very confused but didn't say no to a free beer so he followed me to the bar and got his beer. We continued talking and he played along, asked me what had happened that night and I, who still was convinced that he was ""The plug for the night"", told him everything about it and how a nice night it was. I asked him if he had any supplies with him, how it works when selling, how to use and not to use etc. He still played along and after a while he said ""ok hold on, wait a minute... I'm really not the guy you think I am. But you seem to be a good person so what I'm gonna do is call a number, give him your information and what you want to buy and if he approves, you can have his number"". He called the dude, gave him my name, number and the information that I was interested in buying weed and ecstasy in the future. It soon rang on my phone, I answered and heard a guy with a voice changer thingy, I started to laugh out of surprise and hung up. Me and the guy I still thought was ""The plug for the night"" talked a bit longer, added eachother on Facebook and said good bye.

The morning after I took my phone, went on Facebook and to my surprise saw that the dude I added as a friend barely looks like ""The plug for the night"" from the rave party... embarrased as fuck I wrote to him and explained how mistaken I was. He just laughed and told me ""atleast now you have me as a friend and a plug you can trust, just call him when ever and he will supply you with whatever you want. And hey, lets take a coffee some day"". 

This was almost 6 years ago but it still gets my mind sometimes.

Decided to try MDMA with a bit more experienced friends for the first (and second) time over the weekend.

I originally wrote this wall of text for my gaming friends over on discord, figured I might as well share my thoughts on here as well, not-too-long-time-lurker on this sub.

The first night we got some supposedly premium shit, they had skulls on them. Took about 1 pill in 3 pieces in a span of 6 hours or so. It was by far my best party experience ever. Amazing body and mind high, minor inconviniences like jaw stiffness (gum helps A LOT), and big time sweating (it was also fucking HOT so theres that).

We ran it back yesterday before retiring it for a couple months. The 2nd night, we got some from the same guy, same price, he didnt mention it was anything different than the other ones. We later noticed those didnt have skulls on them... It wasn't the same thing.

We bought 7 of them, I took 4 halves over the span of a couple of hours, didnt feel ANYTHING remotely positive high, and the jaw stiffness was worse than the night before, even with lots of gum. One of my friends took 3 halves, didnt feel anything. 

Other friend didnt feel anything on the first 2 halves, got sick from the 3rd one. One of his friends took a half for the first time and got super fucked and his friends literally left him out in the rain, didnt even give him the carkeys to lay down there. So fucked up, I was actually ready to start some shit with them but they dipped before that, probably lucky for everyone involved in hindsight. 

Tl:dr/lesson; Good ecstasy is fun, careful with dosing, dont drink too much booze on it, but stay hydrated. Joints help a ton the day after when you want to sleep. Make sure you get good shit from a reliable source and check out what they look like, google the symbol/marking on the pill to get some info before you buy.

I am obviously very inexperienced, I hope some people here with more experience can chime in and give directions to me and people in similar situations.

We also had altercations with police, barely didnt get caught, I can write that story down later if people are interested.

I was saying shit like ""i will do coke only in columbia"" but deep down i believed it because i just wasnt intrigued by it. 
One day my plug shows up from nowhere all in smiles and offered me coke. I quickly denied (because of my beliefs around this drug) kindly and said ""thanks bro but i prefer to trip together sometime""
But little did i know that this was only the beggining...
ever since that night he triggered something awful.
Weeks pass and i have killed the thoughts of doing cocaine.  im at the house of my plug (another plug) to meet my cousin who was buying a shit ton amount of weed every week. 
We sit there have a chat and he tells us ""i got 100g's of coke..80 bucks""
She looked me with her eyes wide open and said nothing. Now its funny because she was telling me stories in her work doing coke etc 
The next day i get a message from my cousin 
""Hey are we gonna drink coca cola?"" 
She was working and because of that i agreed to go buy it and return back. 
I go to my plug and smoke weed while we have a chat and i tell him that i want a g of coke. 
He then turns and gets the plate with some fatass lines..at that moment i knew that i was  gonna try and didint even think about it twice.
I do 2-3 lines and after a while its time to go back. 
Obviously i fell in love with the feeling..
Everything goes smooth and im in my cousins house. I snorted 7-8 lines in her house.
Next time im in my plug's home he was already packing a bong with cocaine and ashes. He puts the bong into my mouth and says ""take it as an entrance fee"" i laughed and smoked it. 
after all this i cannot stop thinking about her..
Psychedelics are cool but i feel like cocaine makes me more aware of things + makes me feel like a fucking king. 
Am i fucked brothers? 

TL;DR: a teen was not fucking with cocaine and then with the help of the universe BOOM cocaine in his nostrils. Snorted two times and smoked crack once.

I usually get my vallies from the DW and cost around £1 a pill in pharmacy packaging. I had a bad spell taking these a few months back, but I hadn't touched them for a good couple of months.


20mg would usually have me sleepy and sometimes asleep within an hour. These cheap ones, I've taken them every day this week due to having a really bad few days. Probably about 5 a day after work, and not really felt much. Kinda tired but mostly functional.


Today, I've taken 10 and I'm still pretty functional, I feel like I could go for a drive and interact with people fine. 


Can tolerance really stay around for a couple of months after no use? Or could taking them every day for a week increase it so quickly and highly?

I was so against drugs growing up that even the thought of anyone I loved, like my dad or mom, just taking a drag of cigarette drove me crazy. But once I took that first hit of weed and all my problems were temporarily solved just like that, all that anti-drug shit went out the window. From that point on I had one focus... getting higher. And I’m not talking about graduating to a harder drug. I’m just talking about smoking more and more weed until I was numb. And doing that day after day year after year for what? To escape all my fucking problems, to escape all my insecurities, and forget about my ridiculously high aspirations. And that was fine with me for a few years... but eventually I got to the point where I had to smoke so much weed to get comfortably high that it was a chore. And completing that chore only gave me 30 minutes of joy. After keeping this up for awhile my friends graduated to LSD. I was so against it at first but they did it numerous times in a short period of time and seemed the same, maybe even a tad bit enlightened. Plus, I looked up to a couple of these guys, so eventually I took the plunge. I dropped acid and loved it. I should’ve stopped there but to keep a long story short, which I might fully explain in another post, I did acid about 10 times once every weekend for about 2 or 3 months, and I was just a senior in high school. How fucking foolish and ignorant of me. I don’t wanna know how much my IQ dipped during those 3 months. But I was a motherfucking burnout. A low life druggie burnout who never achieved a damn thing after the 9th grade besides the next high. What a fucking loser. Anyways I knew I needed to put an end to this, so that’s what I did, for maybe half a year anyways. Then one weekend, maybe a month before I graduated, my parents were out of town for the weekend and what do I do? Throw a party like a normal kid? Nooo? I decide to drop acid with my buddies one last time. Here’s what happened, I took 2 tabs, like I used to when I had somewhat of a tolerance, and I tripped balls like never before. I was tripping harder than I ever had before after one hour and I still had another hour to go before I was peaking. Long story short I lost my mind so fucking bad I couldn’t even talk to people and was so scatterbrained I could barely put a thought together without getting an extreme rush of anxiety and spent the next 7 years in this living hell. Spent 7 years hopping from one antidepressant to another. Those never worked so I drank a lot, because the only time i felt free of this curse was when I was drunk. Oh but I didn’t just drink. I smoked weed all day everyday and did cocaine more than my fair share of times. I was so depressed, suicide was always on my mind. I wasn’t ever gonna do it because I could never do that to my parents. But man, when you are an absolute shell of your former self and can’t even have the simplest conversation with somebody, you feel like you are dead. You don’t want friends or family seeing you like that, especially your guardians who raised you and are so damn proud of you. You took their 18 years of hard work, and yours, and shattered it all in 3 fucking months. SO DONT DO DRUGS KIDS, it’s all fun and games until you’re the one who gets burned. Anyways back to the story, after 7 years of hell my psychiatrist suggested I try an antipsychotic along with my antidepressant. The first 3 months were the absolute worse and I was motherfucking zombie. But one day bam... I was me again. Or at least I could somewhat enjoy my surroundings again and make minor conversation. Sure, I still had a lot of work to do, but now I had the tool to actually fix myself, I had my mind back. 

Now to be completely honest I’m glad this happened to me. Even though I wouldn’t wish those 7 years on my worst enemy, they changed me for the better. During those years I was stripped of my ego and was constantly monitoring myself and everything “wrong” with me. That’s why it was so hard for me to have a conversation, because I would literally overthink every single word and overthink every little thing in my life, my mind was exhausted. But, when you spend 7 years examining yourself for every conscious second you are forced to confront someone... yourself. The scariest motherfucker in the world, the boogeyman, your motherfucking self. And the thing is I was so beat down I couldn’t make up excuses for myself. I couldn’t say yeah I was fat but only because I didn’t have time to workout and eat healthy. I was completely honest with myself. I was a fat, dumb, addicted, selfish, spoiled, never worked hard for anything in his life piece of shit. And from that point on I only had one option, become who I was meant to be. No excuses, no bullshit, no hitting the bong and taking the easy way out. Yes I dug myself a deep hole but for the first time in my life I BELIEVED IN MYSELF. I truly believed I could be whoever I wanted to be. Even before the drugs I always doubted myself and put everybody else up on a pedestal. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that I have an extremely mild case of cerebral palsy, I just walk with a slight limp. But that made me different than everybody else, especially on the playground where self esteem is built through sports/games like football, basketball and kickball. The reasons for my insecurities never mattered anyways, and the only thing that mattered now was that THE ONLY PERSON WHO WAS GOING TO STOP ME FROM BECOMING MY GREATEST SELF WAS ME.

By the way, if anyone can relate and is going through some serious serious pain please reach out. I’m not on here often but I’ll try to respond within a week at the very latest. And if you feel you don’t have the strength to fix your problems please please read “Can’t Hurt Me” by David Goggins, or at least watch his videos on youtube. THIS MAN WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE

(If you’re doing this with a benzo or a substance only soluble in PG or ethanol it WILL NOT WORK, so don’t hurt yourself)\
2) Make sure substance is 100% dissolved, even if it means stirring for 10 minutes or hot water baths and draw up in syringe. Make sure there are NO air bubbles in the syringe. Flick if necessary. Making sure it is 100% dissolved is CRUCIAL for substance with low active doses. I got sloppy with mine because 2-FDCK dose range doesn’t have to be precisely dosed. \
*Note to make sure it’s fully dissolved you should be left with the same amount of liquid you started with. (i.e if you dissolve 50mg in 1ml of solvent you should still draw up 1ml, if you draw up more it’s not fully dissolved).

3) Get a blunt tip, lube and lay down in your bed. Line up the blunt tip and lay on your LEFT SIDE. This is very important you lay on the left side so it travels towards the sigmoid colon (I think that’s the name).

4) Lay almost flat on your stomach and insert needle into butt. Only draw up what you intend to plug because precisely reading those ticks is hard with it in your booty. Look up “enema position” to see what position I’m talking about.

5) BOOF! Push the syringe in slowly, and in increments. The more water (solvent) you used, the longer you are going to have to stay lying down.

6) Lay down for at least 15 minutes to let it all fully absorb. WELCOME TO YOUR NEW WORLD OF DRUGS!

I’ve noticed I barely feel anything with 2ml and under. With anything over 3ml I feel an extremely strong urge to shit, even though there’s no shit, so just beware!

I'll usually only take 5mg very occasionally if I'm having a particularly stressful day and just need to unwind.

Fast forward about 30 mins and I'm starting to doze off and this is when it starts.. i'm thrust into an episode of sleep paralysis (happens often to me). If I try to sleep immediately after the episode I just get SP again, so normally I'd turn a light on, scroll through Instagram for about 5 mins, then try and get back to sleep. Only I couldn't do that this time because the diazepam was making me so tired I literally couldn't keep my eyes open, so right back to sleep.

So this is the start of about this crazy cycle of waking myself up from my sleep paralysis, not being able to stay awake for more than 30 seconds, and slipping right back into it. I have no idea how many times this happened but it must have been at least 15+. The longer this goes on, the SP fades, and I just get absolutely crazy dreams. The content of the dreams wasn't so crazy just that they felt so real. I kept waking up feeling totally disorientated, being unsure of what room I was in, who was in the house, who was sleeping next to me (spoiler: no one was), if the conversation I'd just had was dream or real... and one point I even thought I was about 20 years older than I actually am.

We grew apart around 2018 because of my drug addiction, last year when i got out of the first rehab clinic i went to, i looked for her again and we started off a great friendship.

I relapsed and i went this year to another rehab clinic to which i was kicked out of. I felt really shitty and she was always there for me. I really appreciated it. 
I'm not sure what happened. We had grown distant these past month but i thought we were okay. Just last week i made an edit for her and wished her a happy birthday. Everything was cool.

Except today she ended our friendship. 
She just told me that she thinks very differently than the way i do, and she said something about my moral being ""corrupted"" and she said that she wishes the best for me, she told me that she doesn't feel sorry for me and hopes that i one day find someone that understands me, Because she doesn't and is truly DONE with me.

I am truly devasted as she one of the only two irl friends i have and it makes me feel down to think that our long friendship ended.

I developed a very strong aversion to “drugs” after that, and I haven’t done anything besides booze and weed (realistically, much more booze than weed) for going on 4 years now. The anxiety, panic, and paranoia has persisted this whole time, despite counseling and prescription drugs. 

My wife decided she wanted to have a little “extra special” fun for her birthday and got a few points from her good friend. I was pretty reserved when she asked me to do it with her. She’s much more experienced with a larger variety of drugs than me, and the mere mention of anything harder than a few beers always puts me almost into a panic. But, I didn’t want to disappoint her on her birthday. 

I put a couple Truly’s in me and got the courage up to take some. Started off slow and just tried to vibe, put on some music, etc. I started feeling pretty good and had some more. And then some more, and before I knew it, I’d taken almost my entire half without tripping myself out. My wife and I proceeded to have the deepest conversation we’ve had in a very, very long time. Talked about some things that I didn’t think would ever see the light of day, from both us. It was more therapeutic than I could’ve ever imagine. 

She’s gone to bed now (too much to drink), but I’m still up with one small line left for myself. Just chilling and watching the Expanse.

I know essentially next to nothing about controlled drugs, except for the one I’m currently on for my chronic pain- Hydrocodone 7.5/Acetaminophen 325. This post is more of a vent/rant than anything else, I guess.

I was prescribed it almost a year ago for multiple pain conditions- and I used to be TERRIFIED of opioids. Everything is different now. It’s the only thing that touches my pain, and of course has the lovely side effect of making me feel pretty fantastic mentally. Initially, I only took two per day. That slowly turned into three, and now my script is for four per day. Because: tolerance.

Except I don’t take four per day. As soon as I get my monthly script, I’ll take more than that daily- even if my pain isn’t horrendous in that moment. Sometimes I’ll take two, followed by another one or two an hour later- I’ve taken up to 8 in a day before, JUST to enjoy the fucking feeling. I’m hyper aware of my Acetaminophen intake, and that’s probably the only reason why I haven’t taken more than that in a day.

I know this might not sound awful/excessive or anything as a short term thing- but this has been my life for almost (?) a year now.

I have to count out my pills and plan around my refill accordingly. By the second week after my refill, I start getting stressed- will I have enough to last me through the day? How am I supposed to deal with the depression that follows when I start cutting my doses back after those first two weeks of bliss?

Take now, for instance- I blew through so many during my first two weeks that I can only take two per day for the next 12 days. And this is what scares the shit out of me- two per day *isn’t enough* anymore. I become irritable and depressed between doses. I become snippy. I become anxious. And I’m absolutely terrified about how I’d feel going 24, 36, 48 hours without a pill *at all*.

I went 24 hours without a pill months ago, before I started actually abusing them, and I don’t remember feeling anything at all. But right now? If that happened *now*? Things would probably be different- and I’m scared. I hate the fact that I’m not in control anymore. I hate the fact that I have the rest of my life together, but I somehow let myself lose control with this fucking medication. And I hate, hate, *hate* the fact that I’m using them for something other than just my very real, very terrible chronic pain.

I’d ASSUME that after taking an opioid for almost a year straight, every single day, I’d experience withdrawal symptoms eventually if I went cold turkey- right? But my issue is that there is literally *nothing else* that touches my actual, physical pain. I feel trapped.

I feel completely stuck. By finances (to attempt other, safer treatments for my pain- the American healthcare system is a joke), by my pain, by my depression, by everything. 

The most ridiculous and mortifying part? I don’t plan on stopping. It helps my pain, my doctor fills it for me *because* it helps my pain, and I have access to it. But I guess this is me kind of...admitting? Out loud, to anyone who will listen, that I’m addicted, and I’m only realizing it now. I’m an idiot for only realizing it now. After THIS. LONG.

I’m not entirely sure what I’m trying to say here or get out of posting this. I guess I just need someone to hear me, and to maybe understand, without judgment. Or maybe with judgement. I don’t know. I have absolutely *no* idea where I’m supposed to go from here. My next appointment is in 12 days- I’ll be getting the refill, and I know I’ll continue taking it. But maybe I can cut the bullshit and start taking it **as prescribed**? Would that even make a difference at this point?

I don’t know anymore. I just feel completely lost. Anything would help, at this point. Advice? Similar stories?

I know the only real answer here would be to cut the shit and start tapering off carefully- but when you have multiple conditions that require a strong painkiller to allow you to function and go to work, things get...a little complicated. 

Guys, I just don’t know what the fuck to do anymore. Maybe I should just stop talking, take it as prescribed instead of abusing it, and carry on with my life, accepting the fact that *yup*, chronic pain patients can and **WILL** become physically dependent on their pain medication, but that’s no excuse to abuse the script.

I’m quite literally talking out my train of thought here and none of it makes sense to me.

Fuck.

So I've lost a lot of the magic due to my tolerance, and my 150mg trip recently had me feeling a bit underwhelmed. It was nicest when I combined it with weed, so this time, I ate two 200mg edibles 2 hours ago, with 190mg Memantine 1 hour ago(my tolerance for edibles is very high for some reason, don't worry. It's been consistant throughout the years)

Here is a brief summary of the combos I've found enjoyable and not as much, for you all to compare with your own experiences. I DON'T CONDONE COMBINING ANYTHING IM NOT A DR ETC ETC these are just my subjective experiences with them:

Memantine = C (Fun, nice clear dissociation for \~12-18 hours, slightly psychedelic and entactogenic, fun subtle CEVs at +++ doses and very subtle OEVs, Antidepressant effect by itself, lessens cravings for DXM/K/PCx, music enhancement)

Weed (smoked) and Memantine (20-120mg) = (A-. Synergistic. Enhances visuals. Slightly more psychedelic and dissociating. Comfy body load. All around a good time, like breat and butter!)

LSD (\~300ug) &amp; 30-100mg Memantine  =(S TIER, AMAZING! obliterated anxiety, enhanced psychedelia, OEV &amp; CEV ++ with a low dose and ++++ with a trip dose. Extremely introspective, and almost felt like there was a ""shield"" around me, protecting me from any anxiety. One of my favorite combinations ever, VERY synergistic!) 

Mdma (\~220mg) and Memantine (\~30-60)= (A, very fun, seemed to enhance psychedelia and lessen comedown. I did notice slight chest irritability, but couldve been the E or placebo. I was cautious of this combo due to how dangerous dxm and e and pcp and e are. ymmv.), 

Dxm (450mg) and Memantine (\~80mg)= (D, UNCOMFORTABLE. Doesn't synergize well I found, chemicals fight to be most notaceble and side effects of both are enhanced. You will probably be more dissociated, but not in any good sense, recreationally or spiritually. DO NOT RECCOMEND, SAVE ONE OF THEM) 

K (repeated) and Memantine (\~80-150mg)= (C-, no real synergy, helps you temporarily get into a deeper headspace, but you'll burn through your K and they don't really synergize. SAVE YOUR K, especially if it's not cheap where you live! If you're in UK I'd say you'd be the exception. If anything, it feels like you took a slightly higher dose. would reccomend whippits for this instead.)

Nitrous (Repeated) and Memantine (20-120mg)= (A FUN! Out of all the dissociatives I've done, IME this is the best one to do with memantine. 1 8g cartrige feels like 3 cartriges. Dissociation+++, tolerarance to Nitrous goes way down. Be Safe!) 

Alcohol (2-8 drinks) and Memantine (20-120mg)= (\~C. Reverses your tolerance to alcohol, gets you buzzed quicker. 1 drink feels like 3. I dislike alcohol altogether so I'm slightly biased, otherwise, this would be a ""B"". Slight chest irritability. Drinkers will love this combo! Stay safe! Slightly less psychedelic and more intoxicating/dissociating)

Kratom (5-10g) and Memantine (20-130mg) = (B. Reverses opioid tolerance, kratom was much stronger. Slightly synergystic, but almost able to fluctuate between the opioid feeling and the dissociated feeling at willl. Slightly less psychedelic)

Klonopin/Xanax/Gabaergics (1-10mg) and memantine (10-150mg)=(B-. I would say this isn't synergisic, or reduced benzo tolerenace, but it definately had a marked increase in anxiety reduction and overall feeling of wellness taking the two. Less psychedelic. I take 4mg Klonopin daily though so I'm biased here as wel, but it certainly didn't work against each other. Respiratory depression can be a bit unconfortable but hasn't been as issue (FOR ME, ALL THESE ARE SUBJECTIVE). High dose memantine stimulates you a bit more, but it I hadn't found it uncomfortable with my current dose.  

Amphetamine (\~10mg) and Memantine (lower dose)= (A, IF TAKING LOW DOSE MEMANTINE. Helps reverse tolerance to stims and hide comedown/side effects. No experience taking it with a high dose. For fans of Nootropic stacks, you guys would like this one)

Caffiene and Memantine =(C. YMMV.)

Nicotine and Memantine =(B+. Nicotine feels better while somehow at the same time reduces overall smoking cravings)

Weed (Edible) and Memantine (190mg)= TBA. Currently trying this combo riight now. Will report back.

That's all I can think of at the moment, if you guys can think of any combinations I should try or add/remove, let me know! This is a bit of an obscure substance, so I'm trying to get as many reports of combinations in as I can!

I feel like Prozac fucked my head up to where I can’t feel joy anymore...anhedonia or whatever. I abused a lot of drugs mostly benzos. I feel like I am **HONESTLY** done with this life deep down even if I can’t accept it fully due to instincts. I need my benzos back man. I abused them and learned from it I grew older I’m more responsible all I need is 2mg alp every OTHER day if that. Than all I would need for fun is edibles in moderation. If I’m already fucked I’ve died numerous times and had to be brought back I had a serious flesh eating disease in my chest that gave me a 1 in 10 chance of survival. Got through that like a fucking world champ didn’t shed a single tear all I was worried about was give me my benzos and painkillers. Yea when I take a bar I get cravings for other drugs but that’s what the edibles are for or an occasional fucking amphetamine idc if it’s prescription or not. If it allowed any longevity I’d be taking speed in the mornings and benzos at night daily but even if it’s a low dose it won’t last. All I need it to know that if I need or want a benzo that it’s there waiting for me. That in itself is a huge culprit when it comes to me feeling doomed and similar to what an animal might feel at night during a thunderstorm. Home is flooded in unfamiliar territory with a sense that a predator is on their tail planning on making them their dinner. No benzos = no caring/trying/wanting but a lot of hating myself/cringing/thinking it’s all already over. It’s like death paid me a few visits and I fought hard enough for it to retreat and now I’m just on a reprieve to accomplish staying alive atleast until my parents are dead....because I already gave a huge chunk of my heart to someone... and I thought I got over them and just had some low testosterone levels/depression preventing me from being able to pretend im into a person enough for me to think/feel that I may get my happiness and will to live back....but that chunk of my heart is still locked up and forgotten somewhere because after making an off the cuff decision to go to a bar I’ve never been to I saw one of said persons siblings. I wasn’t that excited to go out I just wanted to sit at the bar and be with my depression sipping on a double captain and coke. Once I recognized it was in fact her sister I started to doubt my own perception until she brought me my drink and recognized me as soon as eye contact was made. Her face went from normal to almost mortified she even stopped and took a half step back before I sensed her unease and smiled maybe making her think I didn’t recognize her or that I really don’t seem like the monster everyone painted me out to be out of jealousy and the need for me to fail. All I know is because she was there it made me feel closer to that piece I lost which made me remember what the sum of the broken parts of my heart felt like. She reminded me of her so much because they are full sisters. Does anyone feel like when you find that one you have no chance at happiness without them even if you’d already given up and 110% tried to move on like the other ones.....I knew those didn’t compare. MKes me feel like if I didn’t have such a disgusted view of what I think I’ve either became or always was on the inside emotionally possibly caused by my mother and the way my dad forced me to do things as a child that didn’t make me happy even though o was the ace of the team.

I struggled with social anxiety and general anxiety for the vast majority of my life, as well as depression. I was always a kid who kept to himself, and I never had a large number of friends. 

Once I got to college in 2019, I finally made some good friends. I had never tried any drugs before that, and my friends and I made some spectacular memories together smoking weed, doing DXM and psychedelics, and occasionally drinking a bit of alcohol. 

I fell in love with drugs fast. As someone with the type of personality that I have, I felt like they filled a whole in my life. They brought me closer to friends, I began to meet more people, become more sociable, mellowed out my anxieties, Music sounded incredible, and I began to actually feel happy for once in my life. 

Once I came home from college in March 2020 because of the virus, I felt like shit.

Hey guys so I got myself in a pickle.. i relapsed on meth after sobriety of it 4 years. Im 24 so I really don't wanna screw up my life. Right now, im working a graveyard shift at a gas station and my co employee uses coke nightly and offering it to me every once in a while kinda triggered me to relapse on meth after 4 years. It ruined my life all those years ago and do not want it ruining what I built again!
I am stuck pretty much in a cycle of using meth on graveyard shift and then when my two days off come I try to recover enough to where i can work with feeling like I will collapse of exhaustion. But it is never enough. I have even had times when I took three days off work sick back to back but still feel so drowsy when I return and then I am too overwhelmed by the high pressure at my graveyard job and its mental tasks and physical tasks because I'm too burnt. My boss says I can't have no more call offs. It always leads to me relapsing on meth because of work. I know that I can not let this demon take over me again if I didn't have a job... but that's not an option rn. So I am ordering Adrafinil 150mg/30ml solution online in hopes it can take away the overwhelming mental and physical exhaustion caused by withdrawal for a few weeks. I have high hopes that if it will attenuate part of the withdrawal so that I'm functional at work to not become mentally and physically overwhelmed. What are your thoughts? Or experiences?

Mind you, I had never tried any type of drug, but my friend said it was 100% safe. The first 2 trips were really cool, but the third one left me paranoic for days. Basically I lost all sense of self and went through 2 lifes each in a different dimension, long story short I was trying to go back to the 3rd dimension but everytime I tried I was like ""crushed"", or squeezed, it was a really weird feeling, like specially the lower part of my body was being twisted into a spiral. When I was finally coming back to my senses I kept thinking what I was seeing (my friends and the place I was in) was just a dream, since in the other dimensions this one hasn't been proven as real. After the effect passed I stayed on shock for hours, it was like my whole sense of reality had been altered (ofc it was the drug) but it kept going for so long I thought I was gonna go crazy.

After that I didn't try it for month, I was too scared, but one day we met up I was in the mood and told my friend to give me a very small quantity. This one was even worse, what I remember is being able to ""see"" all the parallel realities from my life, my previous lives and my future lives. I would say they were orbs, but I could see, feel, smell and hear the differences between them. After I started to come back for my trip I really thought I was stuck, something during my trip told me not to do it ever again, it was a threat, but kinda for my well-being. Also, my friend was really scared for me, since apparently I've been crying most of the time, was rocking back and forth and kept saying first things about a monster, then about a child, etc. I guess these were my experiences when I ""looked into"" the realities, I don't remember it tho. Even if I was crying during this one it wasn't as bad as the first, since my reality sense was already weird.

Then, a few months after that one of my friends had a joint and we shared it, somehow I wanted to do an experiment and try to project myself into another dimension (thinking that I could control it), so I laid on the ground and basically did a meditation to go there. It worked too well. First my whole body felt numb and tingly (which is something that happened in my previous experiences as well, on the others it was focalized tho, on my lower part of the body or on my arms), then I also went into some really weird trip, and the next thing I remember was being in the couch watching a movie. But something was really wrong, in the other experiences once I came back I felt here, even if mentally I was really confused, in this last experience I wasn't anywhere, my whole body was still numb and tingly, I kept asking my friend to grab my arm, to eat something, to move around, just to feel something from any of my senses. Eventually it faded out, but to this day I sometimes have the feeling that nothing is real, I don't even know how to describe it, I have also tried to do a meditation and I get to the state of feeling numb and tingly so I get scared and stop. I have hypersensitivity and I have really really low tolerance to alcohol, so I thought my body was overreacting in the same way. I also have really vivid, complex dreams, I can usually remember 2 dreams every night with a lot of detail, in all of them I have 2 consciences and I can choose to turn them into lucid dreams, and I feel like that reality that I saw is really similar to some dreams I've had before any of these.

So, is it possible that the drug left me in some sort of medium state between a higher state of conciousness? Has something similar happened to any of you? None of my friends (who have tried way more stuff than me) or people on the internet who's experiences I've read had been through something similar, it'd be great if someone here could give me an opinion.

So originally i was gonna take 2.5g but since our one friends decided she wasnt in the right mindset we had extra so i ended up taking 3g. The strain was golden teachers. smoked weed about 2 hours before i ate the shrooms for context (high tolerance to weed). 

So i ate the shrooms at like 9:30 and started feeling it at around 10:15-10:30

The comeup was the best part, i always hear about comeup anxiety but i just felt giggly and euphoric laughing my ass off and full of affection. 

I got visuals, my friends tapestry looked like it was right in front of me even though it was on the ceiling. The hardwood floors looked wacky and drinking sprite felt really weird. 

Then at around 11:45-12 we started peaking...
My friend threw up and it was at that moment that it started to become a little overwhelming. Seeing my friend throw up gave me a little anxiety because it made me think i might throw up cuz placebo nausea. i tried not to stress about it and luckily i didnt throw up. I was getting sensory overload so i just sat in the garage and stared out at the rainy and windy driveway. After a bit of that i crashed on a mattress, spooned a pillow and closed my eyes cuz light was too much.

I had a strong body high, it was neither bad or good jus very heavy. I drifted off into this dream space and thought about stuff in my personal life. I wasnt the biggest fan of this and wanted this part to end. I can see how ppl forget theyre on shrooms and are terrified cuz it feels like forever, i didnt reach that point but kinda saw it. I didnt get any of those like ""grand realizations"" or ""new perspectives"". I just felt like my mind was too retarded to think about anything meaningful. I just closed my eyes and came down after that.

After the trip i hung out in my friebds treehouse listening to dinosaur jr at 3am trying to figure out what i just experienced. 

So a few questions.... 
What dose of shrooms would match my comeup for the whole trip?
When do i get the mindblowing experience? Does it come at a certain dose or do i have to do it a few more times?
Ive heard lsd is alot more easygoing and fun than shrooms, is that true?

Let's just say I have someone I'm very concerned about. They're a former drug addict and I just found some stuff on their bed the other night (laying out in the open). I can only guess what this is, so upon confronting them about it, it's denial, denial, denial, take offense at the suggestion, denial, get incredibly upset, hate me, rinse and repeat. Plus, they're damn right when they say things like ""You don't even know what that is and you're going to come at me with this?!""

I've googled, but most articles are too vague for me or too specific towards something this isn't. It's a plastic bic pen that's had both ends removed. Both ends have melted a bit and there is a brown residue inside it. The person is on suboxone and they get a drug screening once a month. The area around where they live doesn't seem to do much drug testing on the weekends, so if they were to get high Friday night, I think they'd be in the clear by Monday.

I've watched this person fall asleep while standing up... then fading like they're reaching to touch their toes, and just about defying gravity by all accounts. Having said all of that though, this \*is\* a good person and I care about them greatly. The consequences for them doing this and ultimately being caught though are... dire. I really hate being in this situation.

Ugh... Identification, advice, resources, or even just a good luck would be greatly appreciated as I'm not sure where to turn, who to ask - or hell, even what to do at this point.

Here's the best I got on what I found:

Just a quick question, that lies in the title.

Me and my buddy have started partaking in some coke for the past month. To keep the post short, my buddy started getting some intense rashes usually after a night of snorting. 

The rashes are pretty painful, and he notice they get triggered when he's either physically hot or in any sort of mental distress.

The rashes don't last long; around 10-15 minutes at most.

I've been searching the internet, but, cannot find any other information regarding this.

Is this normal to experience when doing loads of coke?

It was a group of 8 people and we had 3 and a half people(one person was sleeping until things got really bad.) The journey began around 5 pm. Soon after, the trip was fine, I was making food, everyone was going around doing their thing, vibing to the music. There was a group of folks staring into the house. And then, this one friend lets call him Tom, Tom took 2 tabs and he had done this before and Tom said he's ready for it. Before I could state to Tom that's a horrible idea, I wouldn't want to put bad throughs in his head prior to the trip in case he rejects my suggestion. Also, I found out he did 2 as everyone was taking it and I'm like wtf. regardless. I was busy watching over one group of folks and they wanted food. So I only had 2 other people to make food for like 10+ heads, which is not ideal.

&amp;#x200B;

And then, Tom walks in the kitchen, he proceeds to take a hit of his vape, and let's say one of the members, let's call him John tripping gave the look of judgment and then walked away. Tom felt like he fucked up because john hates it when Tom vapes and usually nags him not to vape if tom comes over to John's house. Anyways, john walks out, Tom starts getting mad and started shaking. Tom feels that screaming out his problems will allow him to see clearly. Instead, he bothers 3 people and 1 other about his nicotine addiction. Tom put down his vape on the desk and starts bashing his head into his arm saying he can't live without the nicotine. I tried to calm him down but he kept walking in and out of the room. I believe the thought pacing himself will work, but he kept coming back into the kitchen saying the nicotine is getting to him. So I tried to talk to Tom and let him know its alright, people can recover and get better. And then, he started harassing the other trippers and began saying questionable things. I didn't realize that Tom could possibly be bi and was trying to come out to John, and kept trying to say things about John. John ran into his room and locked himself in so he can getaway. Needless to say, when Tom realized that John wasn't interested, he tried to go after another who is also tripping balls. Before I know it, Tom took off his pants, no boxers, and tried to run at this girl who was tripping balls, and her man was right there and went over grabbed her, and brought her upstairs. At this point, everyone is scared of Tom. Tom tried to attack ANOTHER TRIPPER without his pants. Now I and this one other tripper kept trying to stop him from going upstairs where everyone else is scared AF and praying he falls asleep except it was only 11:30 PM and they had the rest of the night. I kept trying to keep Tom company, but he didn't like that I'm in the room. Tom didn't like that I was talking, he didn't like it if I looked at him the wrong way.

 I was just guarding the stairs and Tom kept pacing back and forth angry because he didn't realize what he did, he was confused and he kept thinking everything was about him. I was not able to get through to Tom because he kept being violent and told him repeatedly that I'm the sober one. Tom is quick, so whenever he comes by the stairs my first impression is that he might go under my arms. So I just kept putting my body over the stairs. Then, Tom punched my face but luckily only got my forehead, his punch was still off but I was shaken. Tom's face looked so scared after he saw that he punched me, that he ran into the bathroom and kept saying ""I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm dumb"" in a ball in the corner. I never saw someone get so vulnerable and so frightened about what they did. Tom eventually got up and started getting mad that we were with him and kept pacing. Now Tom is in the kitchen, there are some sharp knives in the sink. Tom proceeds to see it, and tries to grab it, the other guy who was tripping balls but could speak to him, shook his head at him. And he let go of the kitchen knife, I was never so scared to have someone walk around the kitchen, anytime Tom came into the kitchen, a part of my heart was pounding that he wouldn't try to take the knife and kill himself or hurt someone else with it.

Tom began to act drunk, for some reason he thought our group trip name ""backyard wedding"" because we had shot classes that someone brought that were wedding-themed, that he is going to get married. So Tom thought he was first trying to marry John, then this other guy then finally the girl he almost sexually assaulted. Eventually, Tom calmed down, and we got him to sleep. The rest of the trippers were so afraid of him, they couldn't sleep and his face of rage anger and like he's going to fuck you up was embedded into a lot of their heads. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am still lost for words to understand how fucked up that night was, how much shit the rest of the group and myself had to suffer due to the reckless behavior of Tom who took double and thought he is fine. I hated the fact that our last night of vacation would come down to ending with the full group scared of their mind in one room because of Tom who didn't fully understand himself what happened. I still feel the bump when he punched me, anyone is planning to trip sit friends, please have someone that could kill the trip like a Xanax or something with you even if you trust them because you never know and don't want to end up in a situation where you can't even approach the person.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,693076,public,confidence,self,"First, time-tripping sitting turned into the worst nightmare I have seen unfold",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hpfqqw/first_timetripping_sitting_turned_into_the_worst/,no_ads,0.0,1594523480.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A doctor who prescribed Ozzy Osbourne with 13,000 doses of 32 different drugs in a year turned him into an incoherent, stumbling wreck, according to the singer's family.
While Osbourne is recovering after an almost fatal crash on his quad-bike at his home in Buckinghamshire, Dr David Kipper could have his licence revoked by the medical board in California after an investigation of his methods. The doctor faces charges of gross negligence for over-prescribing drugs to other famous patients.
According to records released by the singer's family, while he was under Dr Kipper's care Osbourne was simultaneously taking opiates, tranquillisers, amphetamines, antidepressants and anti-psychotic pills.
It is alleged that he was swallowing up to 42 pills a day at times, contributing - his family says - to a deterioration in his mental health.
Prescription records show that he was taking eight doses of amphetamines, nine of tranquillisers, 16 of two different barbiturates, two anti-seizure tablets, two anticonvulsant pills, two painkillers and three sleeping pills.

""I couldn't talk, I couldn't walk. I could barely stand up,"" said Osbourne, before his crash. He sacked Dr Kipper in September, after learning of the official investigation. ""I was lumbering about like the Hunchback of Notre Dame. It got to the point where I was scared to close my eyes at night - afraid I might not wake up,"" he said.
""Ozzy was over-medicated,"" said Sharon Osbourne last week, before her husband's accident. ""Ozzy would call Kipper and tell him how bad he was feeling and Kipper would say: 'Take five more of these and 10 more of those'. It was insane.""
Dr Kipper did not return calls from the Telegraph but has issued a statement saying: ""I have only good wishes for Mr Osbourne and for his family and for their good health."" He said that medical ethics barred him from discussing care.
Dr Kipper has also been charged with running illegal detoxification programmes for addicts, mostly in the Peninsula Hotel, next to his practice in Beverly Hills.
The rise of Dr Kipper is a bizarre Hollywood tale. Unlike most doctors, he has a Screen Actors Guild Card and a string of bit-part roles to his name in films such as As Good As It Gets.
Although he has no specialist training in addiction medicine, he established his reputation after befriending film stars. Osbourne, who has fought substance abuse for a long time, hired Dr Kipper as his personal doctor in June 2002 to help to him beat addiction to prescription drugs.
The family says that Osbourne's 10-day detoxification programme cost $30,500 (£17,450) and was successful until he appeared to relapse when Sharon was diagnosed with colon cancer.
Dr Kipper was hired to monitor Osbourne, accompanying him on the ""Ozzfest"" tour in the summer of 2002 and charging him $32,200 (£18,427) for his services. During the tour, he was placed on medication called Ambien for insomnia and Adderall, an amphetamine mixture.
In the months after Ozzfest, according to Osbourne's records, Dr Kipper added Mysoline, a barbiturate to prevent seizures, and Zyprexa, a powerful anti-psychotic drug.
Prescriptions were issued for Valium and Dexedrine, an amphetamine. He also offered the singer $500 (£312) Buprenorphine-Valium injections, described on invoices as ""pain injections"" but used as part of Osbourne's detox treatments.
One drugs specialist at the University of Southern California said: ""The doctor was stimulating him with uppers and knocking him down with tranquillisers.""
The services of Dr Kipper did not come cheap - $650,000 (£372,000) between August 2002 and August 2003, plus $58,000 (£33,220) for the drugs.
Dr Kipper's lawyer, John Harwell, who will defend his client against the medical board's charges, said that the allegations made by the Osbourne family were either ""inaccurate, incomplete . . . or false.""
The Hollywood actor-director Danny DeVito has come to Dr Kipper's defence, calling him ""the most honest, caring, selfless, responsible doctor we have ever had"".
Speaking before his accident, Osbourne said: ""I see Dr Kipper as a sort of a friendly villain. He befriended me. I liked him. He comes off as a really nice guy - that is until you get the bill.""",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,693073,public,confidence,self,Ozzy lol,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hpf6m9/ozzy_lol/,no_ads,0.0,1594521543.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Go back half a decade and the only information you had to go on regarding precautions/dosage/effects/interactions was the word of somebody else who had taken it, or even worse, the person you were buying it from. Today we are able to collectively assemble and disseminate information and experience in a way that makes it available to nearly every single person on this planet and that's *really fucking amazing*. 

I remember years ago I binge-read a bunch of Erowid's [Datura Train Wrecks &amp; Trip Disasters](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Datura_Train_Wrecks_Trip_Disasters.shtml) just because there were so many of them, and reading them was enough to let me know it probably wouldn't ever be a substance I would be interested in. Had I been born 20 years earlier though and somebody I'm friendly with pulled out a bag of some strange seeds that were going to ""get me real fucked up"" and I were the kind of person that was inclined as to take drugs from strangers, well.. I can imagine having a real fucking awful time. 

Even worse is thinking about the first ever person to ingest datura accidentally without any prior context of a drug/altered state of consciousness.

That would be a *real* fucking trip.

Where are you reading this from? Probably very far from here and yet I'm there and somehow in your mind right now. The inescapable and global grasp of the *Internet* and our eternal engagement with it through the smartphone has been a pivotal (r)evolutionary shift in our history, one even more significant than our discovery of fire, agriculture, steel, or the combustion engine. We are yet to scratch the surface of its potential and power, and the deeper implications of its existence and what that says about us - the Internet is the genesis of a global awakening and awareness of hidden communal connection.

Modern constantly connected culture has allowed us to act as a sort of rudimentary hive-mind. Our access to, and saturation of information, media, and communication is both **constant** *and* **instant** - it is now possible to share our thoughts with almost everybody there is - our friends and family, their friends and family, people we don't know and never will, people in another country, and people who may not even share the same language as us - a single sentence spat out into the ether can potentially reach billions of people on the planet in a matter of minutes.

You, me, and everybody else has a form of direct access to nearly every other human consciousness on this planet - what could we possibly use that for?

**Memes, of course.**

To crowdsource the question of 'what is *good*?', because that is what lies at the centre of all belief.

The fact that we have seemingly become ever more divisive and politically polarized is therefore not to be tutted at, wished away or met with calls for civility, but rather acknowledged as the *only way* in which an outcome - Truth - can be arrived at, copy itself, spread, and propagate to the point where its opposite seems wholly and utterly absurd.

Advocates for either a progressive or conservative approach to policy can not compromise *not* because the facts are in disagreement (although that is true), but because what comes **before** the facts is not agreed upon; that is, the way the world is structured and ordered, or **The Way The World Is**, which itself always acts as the background for an ideology rather than the reverse. The idiom *'seeing is believing'* is true backwards as well, perhaps even more convincingly -  **believing is seeing** and this is evident now more than ever.

I’m going to make some statements that are broad and general, but ones I feel are fairly common and often subconscious. These are not meant to be statements of  “fact"", only associations to get us to think about how we reach the conclusion of ""fact"".

*The relationship between progressivism and conservatism is like the relationship between masculine and feminine which is like the relationship between individual and community.*

Consider this disharmony between two opposing (or complementary)  principles as essentially the basis of all philosophical (and thus political) thought. Also consider opposing principles as really a **single thing** as opposites always exist only in relation to each other. This admittedly sounds a lot like some meaningless new-age woo, but I think most of us can and do recognize the basic and fundamental necessity of this tension between opposites.

We see what our minds project and what our contexts allow - we frame the world in the language we have at our disposal and what words *mean* is not something static and *in* the word itself, but something dynamic, unique to us specifically in the way we *relate* to that word.

Language has an implicit kind of magical quality - by that I mean much like an imagined casting of a spell, it is widely assumed that speaking the right words in the right combination (and order) can influence and compel people to act, and this action is the source of social change. This is why great orators have possessed great influence over the course of history - someone must be able to give *power* to an idea that can move masses to act as a single unified force of nature.

Language is itself inherently biased, limited, and divisive - **Black Lives Matter** means absolutely nothing until it is interpreted and language is always loaded with prejudice, even and perhaps especially when great care is taken to make sure it is not. There is always a fundamental aspect of loss from translating a feeling to a thought to any *thing* else, even when the path is as seemingly direct as from thought to speech. 

Have you ever known *exactly* what to say but been unable to get the words out properly in the moment? 

Have you ever written and rewritten something multiple times because the exact *feeling* you’re trying to capture just isn’t there? 

As much as language is the primary way we communicate, ironically it just as often obfuscates and confuses because the kind of language we have available to us directly determines how we understand and conceptualize the world (and ourselves). It is not a matter of merely being *Peterson-ianly* ""precise"" in our speech, because precision is meaningless if the principles that precede it are incompatible.

How many proponents of any ideology have *actually* read and engaged with its foundational or supporting texts? 

Probably very few.

How many have absorbed bits and pieces through their specific context - language, culture, family, friends, media, and digital memes?

Probably almost everybody.

You simply can't exist in 2020 and not intuitively just *know* what a meme is. Even those that exist totally cut-off from the online sphere would get the picture with some examples. Most typically we think of images like [this](https://imgur.com/Sc1nBL7), or [this](https://imgur.com/yW2QUqt), but these are just some examples of the modern, digital meme and don't begin to even scratch the surface of just *exactly* what a meme is and why the answer to that might be really fucking important.

For example, a picture doesn't need any text to be a meme. Similarly, a picture can be *only* text and still be a meme. A phrase can be a meme, or even [a single word](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/c/c3/D%27oh.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141226214635). A [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_scream). [Symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_S#/media/File:%22Cool_S%22.svg). The structure of the building you're in and the design of the device you're reading this from are memetic artifacts. Musical subgenres, fashion and style trends, social patterns and institutions including family, marriage, property, law, crime and punishment - even complex ideologies - religious, political, and philosophical (all actually inseparable and arguably the same thing) - are essentially very nuanced and enduring memetic conversations that span hundreds and thousands of years.

Human behaviour is memetic - a product of pattern, repetition, and context rather than a series of conscious “choices"" we make at every moment - this is not to suggest we are totally bound and determined by fate, only that we are bound and determined to act in accordance with our own character - we are not *something* responsible for our decisions, we *are* our decisions, and for that we bear responsibility. 

Can you imagine Donald Trump acting like anything else besides a caricature of pure petulance?

That’s his role to play - his constitution. If it weren't he would be someone else, and here lies the crucial error that pervades all levels of society.

I think the belief that he, or you, or I ""make decisions"" is quite backwards - it’s partly a product of the language we use to speak about ourselves and the world - a confusion of the symbol with The Actual Thing - and partly just our basic instincts. It's plainly obvious that I am aware and can consider many possibilities and outcomes and think rather abstractly about present, past, and future, so it only seems to follow that I **must** exert some basic influence over the course of my life, but I think if we really examine that thought there’s no good reason to assume that’s true and necessarily follows. We might *feel* that it does, but perhaps that is a sign to be skeptical of our most basic assumptions.

I find little distinction between *Me* and *My Choices* - I **am** those choices, not a separate entity in the pilot's seat of my skull that ""chooses"" - that stands separate, considers, and then finally pulls the lever that corresponds with the **choice I’ve made.**

Those last three words are superfluous - to me they all reference a single thing - a localized *happening* from my specific perspective.

This idea is naturally unpalatable as it seems to absolve one of all responsibility, for both wrongdoing and ownership of good acts and artistic creations, but I think this is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction to protect our sense of *I* as something distinct and in control, as to accept the opposite comes with a great and terrifying sense of powerlessness. This terror is multiplied further when coupled with the additional quality of randomness, and the ordinary and pervasive accepted fact of our free will  is an attempt to reconcile this powerlessness with our instinctive desire to be in control. Even when faced constantly with the reality of circumstance where one life is destroyed based not on any decision or choice it was able to make, but the simple act of existing at the wrong point in time and space and colliding with the wrong other does nothing to dissuade us of this familiar and comfortable illusion.

Responsibility is not something we *take*, it is what we **are** by sheer virtue of being.

Memes and the repetition of pattern connects us to something far greater than any single one of us - our *collective* human ideas about value, function, purpose, and their relation with each other - memes are a portal to the sum total of all human knowledge, experience, and feeling - memes are threads sewn into the fabric of the tapestry of reality, connecting us to the past, present, future, each other, and something totally separate - something unspeakable that yet demands to be spoken of - something that can be glimpsed only for a moment and reflected only as a fragment.

You may have felt it when engaged in something everyday and ordinary, yet struck as if for the very first time by the majesty and totality of all there is - all experience happening right now, billions of distinct and separate simultaneous *happenings* - connections - disconnected only by virtue of the limitations of our own collective conceptions of what is real, what is true, and what is possible.

What *is* possible?

It is possible then to understand **Humanity** not as an abstracted collection of billions of separate individuals, but as a single, *unique happening of organism/environment* that can act with that awareness of unity and underlying connection.

We currently insist on persisting in an ordering of society that enriches only a small handful that have fallen to the top through nothing other than circumstance and who insist this *must* be the natural ordering of the world simply because it is the current ordering of it. 

Can we really trust those who wield inordinate amounts of power to fairly consider how it might be meted out differently? Is the fate of society directly tied to the fate of the billionaire class, or to the current institutions of governance and policing?

We are meant to believe and accept that this is just **The Way the World Is**? 

As far as I see it, society bears little proof of functioning properly *anywhere* as long as we define ‘properly’ as for the common good of all people. If we instead understand ""properly"" as to the obscene and perverted benefit of a small few at the expense of everybody else, then it is functioning tremendously properly, and will only continue to do so until We put a stop to it.

From where is authority and power actually derived?

The primary source is our shared belief that these institutional structures are legitimate and just - and they are so long as we believe it. 

The secondary source is the ability and willingness of these structures to respond violently if we do not accept the first.

Violence is of course the most powerful and persuasive avenue of acquiring and maintaining power, both literal violent action and indirect violence inflicted and facilitated by a system of organization that regards the principle of one's right to hoard obscene amounts of wealth as higher and more just than an attempt to provide the basic material necessities of life for all people.

That is the basic moral principle that serves as the keystone of the structure of our society *as it is currently ordered*.

To preserve life violence may sometimes be necessary, but violence can be avoided memetically - you cannot put a bullet in a concept and it’s just as futile (and a bit if a moral grey area) to do the same to those who espouse, exemplify, or believe it. Violence can be lessened with the correct memetic foundations to underpin our collective conceptions of 'self', 'other', and 'world' and the reciprocal nature of those three things - violence is given power by distinction and separation, but that power can be neutered partly by understanding that not only are we ourself, we are also every other self, too.

So, if memes are the true catalyst of human action and social change, can we then ""meme ourselves"" into a better reality? Can we, together, engineer, build, or construct a meme to spread and transform our shared, collective (un)conscious and the ideas that follow about not only what is true, *but what is possible*?

I think a good place to start is to understand the **illusory and mutable nature of money and wealth, their direct relationship with power, authority, and control and the distribution of these things**. Money is a real *thing* that performs a necessary *function*, but our shared understanding of it holds real power over its form, and in this way we can collectively shape and alter that power it commands over our lives through a collective psychic exercise.

We can't function without money, but we absolutely can function with a new way of distributing it in hopes of lessening (not eliminating) the amount of suffering directly related to poverty and the misery that flows from that.

Ask Google, ""how many billionaires exist?"" - Answer: 2095.

Do any of them really have billions of an actual, tangible currency or is their currency really in the form of power and influence as represented by money?

Is the standard work-week from Monday to Friday or Monday to Thursday?

Whatever the answer, is that because this is simply The Way the World Is, or might The Way the World Is be directly shaped by our collective ideas about it?

Wars are no longer waged on an actual battlefield - our modern war is a psychic and spiritual one set in the space of the collective human (un)conscious, and the targets of annihilation are not only people but possibilities - the target is Truth, and the creation of Truth As it Serves the Manufacturer - we are in an era of memetic warfare and unless we can understand that and figure out how to twist it against itself our collective human spirit will be swallowed whole, outlived by the last plastic piece of shit we can sell.

2095 problems and one crucial error stands between us and a better society, and building that society is as simple as building, believing, and spreading the right memes.

Cannabis withdrawal is often scoffed at, which I certainly understand given its relatively benign symptoms in relation to other drugs. But I consider myself to be a relatively rational and strong-willed person, and I wouldn't be making this post if it wasn't a challenge. 

Chronic, long term user. Longest period of abstinence in recent memory has been 34 days (symptoms were peaking at this point so I have no concept of how long they would take to resolve). 

Trying again, currently on day 22.

Current symptoms:

Mild:
- Irritability 
- Emotional volatility (interestingly, alternating cycles of euphoria and depression)
- Appetite suppression
- Low-grade fever sensations
- Muscle pain
- Cravings

Moderate:
- Difficulties with sleep onset/latency
- Hulk strength boners &amp; increased libido (not bad!)
- Increased energy/wakefulness (not bad!)

Severe:
- Night terrors/REM rebound (bad!)
- Cold sweats
- Sleep duration (averaging about 4-5 hours a night because the night terrors jolt me awake every couple hours)
- Sleep paralysis and hallucinations in the moments in between temporarily awakening from a dream and falling back asleep into the same dream
- Body temperature fluctuations

What I've tried, in order of what has helped the most:

1. Phenibut

A 1.5g dose of phenibut gave me a feeling of sleepiness I hadn't felt in weeks at the end of the day. I also slept beautifully, for 8-9 hours with no perceived night terrors

Caveat:
This was my first time consuming phenibut, a week ago. I have not since tried it again due to discussions I've seen regarding it's addiction potential

2. Exercise

I have consistently exercised throughout these weeks and noticed that sleep quality is much worse on rest days

3. Mindfulness/meditation

Helpful in sleep onset and in maintaining positivity regardless of emotional extremes

4. CBD concentrate

Helpful for cravings, but I believe this is largely placebo due to the habitual action of dabbing something

5. Benadryl

Helpful in sleep onset but no perceived effect on sleep quality 

6. Magnesium Glycinate

Slight improvement in sleep onset

7. 3mg Melatonin:

No perceived effects

8. Oleamide

No perceived effects 

9. Lemon Balm extract:

No perceived effects 

What I read may help but have not yet tried:

- Gabapentin (prescription)
- Zolpidem (prescription)
- Benzos (prescription)
- NAC
- Trazadone (prescription)
- Prazosin (prescription)
- Naltrexone (prescription)
- Nicotine patches (??) I don't get it either but here's the study:
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-020-05476-1
- Passionflower
- Kava kava
- Valerian root
- Magnolia bark extract

Other details:

* No history of (frequent) night terrors in adolescence, or of insomnia 
* Usage has consisted of flower + concentrate + edibles, each consistently now for years
* Tapering has been attempted in the past which greatly helped sleep issues. But main concern is whether this is simply delaying &amp; extending REM rebound
* Concerned whether REM suppressing medications/nootropics listed above would simply delay/extend REM rebound
* Have tried many drugs but no history of substance abuse other than cannabis 
* A powerful introspective LSD experience is what has motivated me to push for sobriety to this extent

Well, I've been thinking about several techniques that may or may not have been tried throughout time, if they have tell me, so I can do more research. If they haven't, perhaps I'll find a way to engineer them.

1. Sugar cubes. This technique feels familiar, somehow. But, I nevertheless feel like it would be easy enough to create, there are dozens of tutorials to make your own sugar cubes. I feel some pure LSD (solution, obviously. Me and my friends called it ""wash"", I don't know how universal that is), maybe in lots of 600ug could be put into the cubes. Would it be fun to suck a sugar cube as you slowly slip away? Keep out of reach of children lol.

2. Ice cube. Similar thinking, even easier to make. Maybe let melt in a nice whiskey, or your homemade lemonade.

3. LSD bread. This one may be a little more difficult. The melting point of LSD is around 83° Celsius, however most bread bakes above this. A lean dough bread can bake at 87° Celsius, so maybe you could sneak LSD into the final stages of the process. I think going for a picnic and eating your LSD in your bread would be a good way to have a nature trip.

4. This one I feel is the most unreliable theory. Adding LSD to one of those humidifiers. I couldn't find a spice for the gaseous point of LSD, however I wonder if a humidifier could teach it? Maybe wasteful, but a fun method nonetheless, provided it works

I realise I'll probably get very few up votes, but those who read, feel free to add more or point out flaws in my theories.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,693055,public,confidence,self,Ways to consume LSD,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hpe14m/ways_to_consume_lsd/,no_ads,0.0,1594517590.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I haven't been doing well mentally for a very long time. It's to the point that I can't feel proper emotions. Like I'm void of any and all emotions, just a hollow being existing.

I steal my dad's tramadol (he injured himself a long time ago and still has a few packs left) just to feel something. I honestly don't know what to do because it's my only way of being able to feel, well anything. Even the numbness helps to keep the emptiness away.

My parents are emotionally unavailable and I've burdened my friends enough with my problems. I'm sure I'm just slowly digging my grave as my intake increases but I've given up. I've chosen this path anyways so it's my problem.

I'm not doing it cause I think it's cool, I understand the dangers of misusing/abusing drugs and it's affects, I haven't even told anyone I'm taking tram. I just want to feel something. I just needed to get it off my head, I'm helpless right now. 

I'm just thinking of the future, if when I'm older I'll end up depending on more dangerous drugs and ending up like an addict.

Ever since popular culture made a huge ordeal about permitting, respecting and enforcing the rights to changing your sex how-so-ever you wish, and being unquestionably respected for however you wish to go about it... be it with drugs or surgery, etc... it occurred to me – to a great degree – that the right to influence your state-of-mind (how-so-ever you wish to go about it, i.e. drugs) should be equally permitted, respected end enforced; anything else would be completely hypocritical.

If Joe wants to be Josephine and change his sex with hormone pills, then I should damn well be allowed to modify my state of mind with drugs. I should be allowed to take something that mellows me out regardless of the drug in question, how a doctor perceives it, or society's adopted stance to the drug. I should be allowed to take something that makes me more awake, alert... or for that matter anything that allows me to reflect more deeply on life... or spiritual matters.

If the world is going to make such a huge ordeal about sexual fluidity, it would be crazy to differentiate the right to mental fluidity.

It was my friends birthday and he borrowed a house from his grandparents middle of the woods with no neighboors, around 3 hour travel with train to get there then 1 hour with a bus then walk 30min. We had spirit, beer, 10g of mdma crystals and 25g of hash and was going to stay there for 3 days.

We finally arrived there in the evening but one of his friend was late and the other 2 came next day. While we were waiting his friend called saying he got a ride and was almost there, so we started to roll a joint to smoke while we were waiting.

When he arrived he seemed really weird, he stumbled out of the car and pulled out a bag with 200 1mg Alprazolam (Ksalol), I didnt really knew what it was back then but he ate them like candy. The girl that drove him there was apparently a random person he got in contact with and was mad that he ate them in the car and lied about how far it was, but she decided to join us.

We started to weigh our mdma doses but I passed, I felt that something was going to go wrong, I've never felt such a strong ""this is going to go really really wrong"" feeling.

They took it and while they were waiting my friend rolled a fat joint that we smoked while drinking, when the mdma kicked in for them I found out that my friend had taken benzo too (3mg) and holy shit, he looked so braindead, dead inside, no eye contact, looked like he had no soul and fell on the floor over and over again and broke things.

The other guy looked like he had a (what I thought back then) seizure, I could see white foam from his mouth while he was shaking uncontrollably like crazy and didnt answer us at all, the girl and I freaked out and wanted to call the ambulance but my friend said that he's fine it happened before don't call. The entire night the girl and I ran up and down the stairs to check on them and constantly about to call the ambulance.

Later they just passed out, but he was breathing, so 5 in the morning the girl and I went to bed upstairs and slept in the same bed (but no sex sadly).

The next day the entire house was so damn disgusting, everything was a total mess but they seemed to be okay. The guy didnt remember anything but when I explained everything he just said ""I must of had a good time"", but a good time is nothing without the memory of it? He also said it was good that I didnt call the ambulance and that he is immortal and shit.

The girl had to leave so I asked her if she could drive me home but she had to go to work which was nowhere near where I lived.

Fastfoward to when the other 2 arrived that day they instantly asked if we had benzo, thats when I really wanted to leave but didnt know the way home.

I went to bed before they even started (said I was not feeling well) but couldnt sleep since it sounded like a warzone down there, but when I finally fell asleep they came in like it was a god damn zombie apocolypse, and the zombies tried to communicate with me.

They left after awhile and the next day the guy with the benzos said he had to leave because he had to sell his benzos, he ofc didnt know the way home but at that moment I didnt care and left with him anyway, I cant stand another day (he gave them benzos before he left).

He kept asking random people if they wanted to buy benzos right infront of people on our way home, he didnt had money for the train so he sadly got kicked off somewhere (he said that I didnt need to pay for his ticket because he ""wont get caught"").

I made my way home with a smile and relief but also fear of benzos, the addiction, the way they act and all. Back then I loved to get really fucked all the time, large amounts of Alcohol, Mdma, Tramadol, Weed and Ritalin, but that shit scared me more than any other drug.

My friend didnt remember much that happend and he got caught because they never got home and their parents had to pick them up, they saw how messy he and the entire house was and found drugs (don't remember exactly what they found), but he basically said ""fuck benzos"" and never took them again.

I've tried benzos later tho, only 0.25mg (except 1mg during Tramadol withdrawals but don't remember how it felt) but I can see how amazing it is for people with anxiety, its pure bliss to not feel anxiety for once but please be careful with them and don't ruin parties by bringing benzos.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,693014,public,confidence,self,A story of why Benzos scare me more than any other drug.,0,[],0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hp990m/a_story_of_why_benzos_scare_me_more_than_any/,no_ads,0.0,1594499648.0,,,,,Custom,9469b226-728a-11e9-b0d5-0ebd9c4fbbf8,Long Post,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Had to be admitted to the hospital, and they just told me I was having a bad trip. I couldn’t sleep that night and had racing thoughts.

The day after my bad trip I constantly had the derealization feeling, but was doing okay.

14 days went, and during these days I was totally happy and was just continuing life as usual. UNTIL

I was driving and suddenly got hit by this derealization sensation, the feeling that I was about to faint. It was very scary and I couldn’t breathe. That night I couldn’t sleep because of my anxiousness, and the weeks following that episode was horrific. Anxiety and nervous every second, insomnia etc. Now after 4 weeks (from the panic attack) I am in a constant nervous state. The anxiety is lingering and it’s a depressive feeling. I barely sleep 4-5 hours during the night.

Things have improved from the first week, and I don’t sense derealisation anymore. However it feels like this anxious feeling is going to be following me permanently. It’s unbearable.

 I've been an opiate addict for a long time and tried many drugs. Drugs that are 'uppers' have the most 'obvious' euphoria. For example if you take adderall/coke/meth/speed/MDMA you will get this shining bright euphoria, self confidence, energy, and other drug-specific feelings (for meth like you are king or for MDMA like you love everyone). However, you owe these drugs back what they delivered to you. After a meth binge, or lots of MDMA use, or staying up all night on coke you will feel like shit. To an extent this aspect is similar to an alcoholic hangover.

On the other hand, for many people who experiment with heroin they are underwhelmed (not including IV usage, but most experimenters rarely ever IV first time). They just feel good, chill, happy, but they feel like this spooky drug 'heroin' hasn't delivered. They are just mellow. Oh obviously it has all been a lie they will think. Heroin isn't spooky, it's chill. It's not addictive like everyone else thinks. It doesn't make you do stupid shit or stay up all day and hallucinate like amphetamines or coke. It doesn't empty your serotonin like MDMA or give you a hangover like alcohol. People tend to just think oh, what a nice drug.

So the next day they wake up and everything is normal. No headache or shitty feeling--just a slight afterglow of that nice feeling. Oh it was cheap as well! It only cost $10 for a whole night of being high! I thought people said heroin was expensive? And then next weekend comes... There are all these drugs I could do but I liked heroin. It didn't 'fuck me up,' I could still think clearly. No hangover. No feeling like shit later. I still was awake. It just made me happy and content with life. Oh and it's only $10! Well, I should get some more for the whole weekend. This is great! I will use Heroin on the weekends now!

Now let's say this person works and has responsibilities. He knows he can't go into work drunk, or on MDMA, or high. So he doesn't. It's actually simple. But heroin... Well the user might actually find they do better work on heroin. Instead of being sad or grumpy or depressed with his job... he is just... happy. Mellow. Content. Everything is fine and the world is beautiful. It's raining, it's dark, I woke up at 5:30AM, I'm commuting in traffic. I would have had a headache, I would have been miserable, I would have wondered how my life took me to this point. This point I'm at right now. But no, no, everything is fine. Life is beautiful. The rain drops are just falling and in each one I see the reflection of every persons life around me. Humanity is beautiful. In this still frame shot of traffic on this crowded bus I just found love and peace. Heroin is a wonder drug. Heroin is better than everything else. Heroin makes me who I wish I was. Heroin makes life worth living. Heroin is better than everything else. Heroin builds up a tolerance fast. Heroin starts to cost more money. I need heroin to feel normal. I don't love anymore. Now I'm sick. I can't afford the heroin that I need. How did $10 used to get me high? Now I need $100. That guy that let me try a few lines the first time doesn't actually deal. Oh I need to find a real dealer? This guy is a felon and carries a gun--he can sell me the drug that lets me find love in the world. No this isn't working, I need to quit.

To answer your question, heroin feels nice. That's all, it just feels very nice. You can make the rest up for yourself.

About the size of a ant and light blue in color with a engraving that reads “a215”. I should note that authenticity of of these pills are doubtful since I ain’t personally get them from a pharmacy. However reading about how common histamine reactions are with this drug i assume it’s real since my high as well as the side effects seem on par with what Percocet is suppose to do. I should also note this was my first opioid experience. So no tolerance.

3 days ago I snorted maybe 6mg worth of crushed up pill and snorted 10mg more about a hour later. When I woke up in the morning I had a swole ass lip and hives on every part of my fuckin body. I researched and found it’s just a common histamine reaction and Benadryl will help. 
So I took no more then 150mg of Benadryl a day for 2 days straight. I showed healing progress but still ITCHED LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER. So on the 3rd day I’m still on Benadryl but suddenly I’m reacting bad. Both lips are swole again, my eyes are puffy and I’m heavy breathing. Fearing for my life I check myself into the emergency room where they immediately hit me with epinephrine and steroid and hives, swelling and itched went away instantly. And they sent me back home. Which is where I’m at now. I should also say this was the first allergic reaction I’ve had in my life. 


So I basically have a couple questions for my opioid vets since I still have 2 pills left. 

- Is this something I can expect every time with Percocet?

- Did this happen cuz I snorted it instead of orally taking it?

- What can I do/take to prevent this from happening again?

From what I remember I have in the past also misinterpreted things in the distance or peripheral vision while high which can be for example a dumpster looking like people or something. (This I understand is worrying to some extent but yeah it hasn't happened in forever.)

The plan was for there to be at least one sober person per lsd participant so I found a few friends and ended up finding 2 people to trip with this would also be there first time and a few friends to watch over us we felt it was necessary to have a little more sober people in the room with us we had 5 sober to 3 intoxicated and please keep in mind that we all did lots of research leading to the experience the trip sitters read about being trip sitters and anyone consuming the lsd was required to at least a little background in the drug before agreeing to take and we did lots of research I found the Youtube channel psyched substance helped me a lot in the days I had to prepare my self I watched a lot of videos to make sure I had the right safety precautions in place and just like they said on that channel the best way to be safe if to not take any drugs nothing safer then being sober in these situations but I recommend people do more then we did we all knew what we were in for at least as much as you can know without doing the lsd but we didn’t find out the Dose and didn’t test it and I think everyone should do those things I was safe but not everyone maybe that lucky test your stuff for sure I only knew I was safe because my dealer had done a lot of what he was selling me i had seen him do it and I figure if it was dangerous to consume he at very least would have show some kind of side effect of that but test it safer then sorry but now about a week later we gathered are trip sitters and took are tabs they were gel tables we cut them up and picked up the tabs with steel tweezers then put them on our tongues and they went away pretty quickly honestly quicker then I thought it would no real tase really kinda sweet you could find a little bit of a sweet taste if your looking for it but all in all a simple process we took it and set a timer for 45 minutes as we were sitting waiting for it to kick it we figured we would also smoke some weed while we were waiting for the effects and personal I think this not only made my trip more enjoyable for the first few hours at least leading up to my peak I was feeling pretty good and I do think the weed helped that a lot after the first 45 minutes i was feeling it but nothing really crazy maybe even nothing more then the weed until I start to feel a little more awake and honestly pretty aware of my surroundings I felt pretty good but my friends were going through some other stuff one wasn’t having a bad trip or anything but definitely felt the effects stronger then I think I was at that point he was finding doing things like reading on his phone or typing in his address for food delivery was pretty hard for him telling me a lot of times over the course of the first two hours that he still hadn’t managed to order anything but he swore he was trying and now around the two hour mark is was feeling a little different walking was getting hard I was losing the energy I had from before and traded it for the need to sit down and kind of hold my head in my hands and gather my thoughts and this is when I started to I think really feel the difference of being high off of my weed and this closing my eye and sitting there was pretty trippy at that point but if I didn’t have my eyes close and wasn’t putting all my focus on what I was feeling I wasn’t really tripping to hard yet I was even thinking of taking another tab and I’m happy I didn’t it was to demanding hoping to feel really different really fast but it did hit after about two hours and thirty minutes I found my self peaking I was laughing harder then normal and laughing a lot and was having mild visual effects like the ghosting effect when I moved my hand and when people moved but when my eyes were open I definitely still knew I was on acid but at this point closing my eyes felt unreal I was 100% tripping nothing really over the top just enjoying the body high of it also to note I felt very warm the whole time at least that’s my experience I was pretty warm and felt like laying on the floor and processing everything was my best bet and I did and it was pretty great I hadn’t thought of anything negative in hours I felt all and all relaxing and let the trip take me where ever it felt like once reaching the three hour mark I felt i needed rest no sleepy or tired almost like I had just got home from a hard day at work I didn’t want to move or really even talk mostly trying to focus on breathing and taking in the effects but I was social the whole time I made sure the tell people how I felt and still was checking on my friends as well making sure everything was going alright and this is probably where I felt the most lucid I was in all senses just chilling I was in a warm environment safe if I felt I Was rolling pretty hard there was nothing much to do but talk out loud about it and to let it happen and that’s what I did and let me say that’s still over the best advice once you place the tab in your mouth just accept the flowing trip if you know that once your in it your in it the whole way it becomes easier to let go your gonna be high so might has well relaxer your self because I was in a very safe place and felt pretty good it made it feel amazing it wasn’t like anything I’ve experienced that’s for sure I could go more in-depth with it if this post gets any kind of attention but at time of writing this I’m about 10 hours in and still feel some effects but nothing to crazy things still feel go to look at and touch but I don’t really feel like sleeping yet but my friend who took some not long before it did said that after about 14 hours that’s when I’ll start to really want to sleep and I’m his case also feel the need to eat a lot but it anyone wants a part two for this where I can try and talk about that I was seeing and feeling more as well as the day after effects and anything else anyone wants to know id be happy to make another

So I took what I think was speed the other night and basically had a weird time with it. I'm here again because I took it again under slight pressure but that's no excuse. 

So a few days ago, I think was Monday, I bought ""molly"" which wasn't molly at all, and I stayed up for hours on said molly which I asked about on here and got a few answers like meth and speed. So anyway, I had a decent time on it and abused it for like a whole night and day, I'm not exactly sure how much I was given but I got told it was around 10mg worth or more. 

Anyway, I slept okay the next night because I took like 5 Aleve Pms and knocked out. Today, I realized that they were people over and I just wanted to hang with them (they're my brother's friends) 

And they had a ""Molly"" cup passing around, my boyfriends brotheris the one who sold the fake molly to me by the way,  and they told me to take a sip and have a good time and i said no that's fake shit thats speed and they swore it wasn't fake so so I took a sip. It was fake.

Now I think I may have overdosed. Because my heart won't stop beating fast and I've taken like 8 eleven pms and it isn't working at all. I cannot go to the hospital because I've been there too many times due to stomach problems. I had only an acai bowl this before I drank the fucking thing. Now I'm freaking out, my heart won't stop beating and I'm just so not myself and I just feel like really awake and agitated and I can't stop it anything to help me? 

By the way it took me forever to type this paragraph because it is so hard to control my fingers they are shaking . I'm not sweating or feel any pain anywhere just flipping out over the fact that my heart won't stop beating so fast.

That night I didn't start drinking until I got there and planned on having a calmer night and not drinking much. I had a white-claw and a shot of liquor at the makeshift bar area and stopped there. 

&amp;#x200B;

By the time I went back to the dancing area to find Zoe I felt like I was had 15+ drinks and was extremely happy and energetic. Trying to find her in this small house became difficult because when a girl would face me I would think it was her for like 10 seconds while I stared at these strangers. By the time I actually found her I couldn't stop talking and the I started touching her hair because I found it fascinating. I went back to dance and felt like I kept seeing some of my other friends there but there faces would morph into strangers after a few seconds, like a mirage. After dancing and staring at people trying to figure out who they were I felt like I was too drunk to stay to and needed to go to sleep it off. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the way out I thought I had found Zoe and was hugging her and explaining why I needed to leave, when I pulled back I realized it was another stranger and brushed it off. I left and actually found Zoe and said that I needed her to drive me back to her place. Walking to her car to sit and wait for her I was skipping and singing to no one. I felt like I was glowing from the inside out and ""elevated"". The last thing I remember is sitting on her couch when we got back around midnight. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next day I woke up in her guest room and it didn't feel like the last night ever happened, after falling in and out of consciousness I fully woke up around 8 am. It was light a light switch flipped off, instead of hazy fading in and out with blacking out with alcohol. I had puked in her car and her apartment but didn't feel sick at all or had any memory of it. I myself was covered in vomit but I couldn't find the feelings to care. When I went to find her I felt like everything was a mirage. She seemed like she wasn't real. The posters on her wall were swirling, any noise in the house sounded like it was talking to be but that I just couldn't comprehend it. Everything took a ton of effort to try to comprehend and it felt like small actions were huge deals. I started panicking and felt like the entire place had bad vibes and that I needed to leave immediately. I left my belongings there because I felt like I bad things would happen if I took them with me. I called an uber and hurriedly explained that I was tired and wanted to sleep in my own bed. Walking out of the apartment building I tried to find the exit but every-time I thought I had found it I would reach for the door and it would dissolve into the wall. I finally found the exit after about 10 mins and got in the uber. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt extremely tired so I made coffee when I got back and drank it quickly trying to wake up. I couldn't be awake anymore so I went to my room and went straight to bed in my clothes. I slept for about two days straight. I didn't question anything about that night until I woke up, I started panicking when I remembered that I had only had two drinks and started to question if I had been drugged. For three more days I could barley leave my bed. I felt like I was a shell, or like I was thinking ""from the back of my brain"" and that the thoughts were struggling to come to the front where I could understand them. I felt like all of my feelings and motivation had vanished except for feeling tired. I didn't care about anything, I could only find the energy to eat snacks that were near my bed and only left the bed about twice total for the bathroom. It felt like an extremely intense emptiness/nothingness. Everything hurt but I didn't care, all I was worried about was that this was how my brain was now and that I would have to struggle everyday like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up at the end of this one morning and it felt like all of my feeling had snapped back and suddenly I could feel emotions again. It was overwhelming and after having none even though it seemed like I wasn't overly emotional. I got angry and started to actually process what had happened and started seeking out people I had seen that night. I learned that I had also smoked weed after we got back (although I smoked occasionally so this wasn't shocking) I called a hospital to get drug tested but they said it was probably out of my system by then anyway and not to bother.

We’ve all been there including myself and here’s a few things I’ve learned to not get caught and to be safe.


1. Maintain a positive relationship with your family.

This is important because if you have a good relationship with your family they will be less suspicious of your behaviour and it’s just fun to be friends with your parents.


2. Sourcing drugs 

It can be hard to actually attend a drug deal, I did some real stupid shit to get drugs like getting the dealer to come to my bedroom window and buying it through there (DON’T RECOMMEND) . The best way I’ve found to get drugs without getting caught is to either walk your dog if you have one and meet the guy in a park or to go hang out with your friends somewhere and buy it with them. Don’t send drugs to your family mailbox (I did that with 50 tabs of lsd and my dad took me to pick it up from the post office). 


3. Consuming the drugs

I wouldn’t recommend coming home high on anything if you have to talk to your parents, it’s very easy to know when someone is high. For smoking weed, you should either invest in a vape or one hitter. For the one hitter, make a sploof, go outside and hit it once somewhere your parents won’t know. With a vape, you can likely get away with hitting it on your room if you follow some simple steps: use a sploof, have an open window with a fan pointing to it, have a towel pressed under your bedroom door, close any vents and use clear eyes just in case they walk in. 


4. Hiding paraphernalia

This will depend entirely on your room setup but here’s a few ideas:
- inside a pc
- recently moved? Keep a couple cardboard boxes and put them in that
- disguise your bong as a lamp by just putting a lamp shade on top 
- get some storage cubes
- hollow out other electronics
- inside a tv cabinet
- inside the walls
- make a false bottle drawer
- don’t do drugs in your parents house 
- Mount a box underneath your desk


5. Testing kits.

I know from experience it can be difficult to get a testing kit to your house but you can find companies that offer discrete mailing services, ask your dealer to get one for you or find a physical store that sells them and go pick them up.


6. Balance drug use with schoolwork.

Failing school just causes so much more stress and complications. I regret not working harder during school. I was one of the kids who would just show up high everyday and smoke on the oval, I even came to school on acid a few times including during my exams (also don’t recommend that)

Im 17 yo male and i have been everything but drunk and its pissing me off. Its not that i dont drink alcohol, its that i consume large large fucking amounts and whilst all my mates are pissed i still dont feel anything.

I first noticed this last year when i went to a free with a few boys to get pissed. I had 9 beers (heiniken 4.5% alcohol i think) and played beer pong and other drinking games and everyone was fucken smashed BUT ME. I thought i was doing something wrong or maybe i was drunk idk if im supposed to feel something but i felt absolutely nothing and i was completely normal.

Then a few weeks ago i went to another free and this time i got 700ml vodka with 40% alcohol. My mate had these like 100ml cups and i poured 100ml and drank it, my throat was fucking burning i felt like i just drank poison. I sat and waited 5 mins and i still felt nothing and everyone else was already pissed, so i poured another 100ml drank it, felt nothing, then another 100ml drank it and half hour later still feeling nothing. 

Btw i hadent eaten anything a few hours before me drinking so my stomach was empty.

I stopped at 300ml vodka cause i thought that was already way too much and there was no point drinking anymore i could feel my fucking tonsils crying at the back of my throat.

Am i just retarted and doing something wrong or are most people going to be drunk at 300ml vodka?

Am i supposed to feel something, like am i drunk and just dont realise, cause if i was drunk thats pretty fucking shit, i didnt get any hangover or anything ughhh idk what to do, i feel like any more alcohol and my livers gonna collapse fuck.

I made this playlist I called “chillin and killin” which is mostly screamo rap or otherwise heavy music over electronic kind of beats, I found this artist King Yosef and his songs are kind of scary as fuck. It got me thinking, would it scare the shit out of me if I Tripped and spent some hours listening to/watching scary music videos? 

If you want check out this song, it’s only 2 mins. https://youtu.be/QwApV3j66bA this is the kind of music I have on the playlist. Not sure why this song in particular REALLY creeps me the hell out. It’s kind of freaky.

The other scariest song I can think of is [Blood by Velvet Acid Christ](https://youtu.be/6Po_v17fIPc), listen if you dare. Lol. This band is one of my favorite industrial groups and the guy  is known for producing music while on a FUCKTON of acid 24/7...so maybe I’m onto something.

I had smoked DMT several times and I thought this would be no different. The friend who gave me the spiced leaf Said that it wasn’t really strong and that she had no real effect on her. I took that in my stride and popped the leaf into my cannabis pipe and decided on the whim that I would film my experience.
I let my husband know that I was going to give this a try and he asked me “do you want to trip sitter?” I told him I didn’t think I would need one as our friend had mentioned it wasn’t really that strong.
Holy fuck. This was nothing like I expected and I blew my fucking socks off. As soon as I took the first Toke on the pipe my husband called out from the other room “Jesus Christ that stuff smells strong“ and I took my second puff. My third puff was when hubby came into the room and said again “Jesus that stuff smells so strong“ as I blasted off into the DMT 12 dimension. All of a sudden my teeth started grinding hard. I started to dry rich and my hubby set me up so that I would not throw up and aspirate. (On a number of different occasions DMT has made me throw up, so whenever I have it, I prepare accordingly with a little “sick basin”) The next thing that happened I can’t explain. Suddenly I started having “seizure like fit (kicking out, throwing my body) while drumming my heels into the bed. I spasm so violently I kicked over the tripod that was filming, (oh yeah it was filming the entire time.) The next part is even more terrifying because of the noises that the camera picked up, while pointed at the ceiling. I started to yell out and it was all gibberish or some foreign alien language and my husband was calling my name the entire time. This trip lasted for 25 minutes. As I slowly returned to my body I felt an overwhelming sense of love and compassion from my husband, but at the same time I felt like I had just got my arse kicked for being disrespectful and careless.
I became aware that my husband was holding me on the bed and he finally relaxed and let me go. I felt like I had been ripped out of my body through the back of my head and then kicked around the octagon a few times and then shoved back into my body rudely and roughly.
After the trip had ended I watched the video back and it was unbelievable and a little frightening at the same time as incredibly informative.

So I just came off a 10 day T-break, and go to pick up my script of 15mg XR adderall. Pick up the paper copy, head over to the pharmacy, get told to park because it'll take a minute. Weeelll, they fucking forgot about me for 30 minutes until I went in and asked for my speed, please. I thought that was the end of the shafting I was going to receiving from the pharmacy today, but not so.

&amp;#x200B;

I notice the bottle is different. Its got a different label around the top, etc. When I get home and open it open, I find out that it wasnt blue-and-white Global Pharmaceuticals like normal, but a green-and-white ANI Pharmaceuticals (Might be UMP pharm, bit unclear on that)  
Anyways, who cares right? Amphetamine is amphetamine. I even like the new pills better aesthetically.

&amp;#x200B;

But then I opened one.  The beads are fucking TINY, like half the size of the normal ones. This makes crushing them almost impossible. I beat those fuckers like the owed me money with the bottom end of  a security baton, but they just don't crush as easy as the other ones.

&amp;#x200B;

I took 35mg via parachuting (post-crushing, of course). It's nothing like the old ones at all. I don't get euphoria at this point, but it definitely does give me a noticeable mood boost, especially after 10 days. It's nowhere near as stimulating, energetic, and even the side effects aren't as pronounced. It just is not as strong, and maybe that's because I fucked up crushing it? About an hour ago, I snorted about 25mg. No rush, a bit of energy. And again, this is after 10 days of no tolerance. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I noticed last night a few hours after first dose was feeling periodic heart beats that I noticed.  Not sure if these are palpitations or something else to worry about, or just my body getting used to less adrenaline and slowing down and I'm noticing things that I wouldn't have noticed before.  Whenever they happen they surprise me.    


I'm also on an lisinopril - an ACE inhibitor, metformin/glucophage (for Type 2 Diabetes), and take melatonin to sleep.  My doctors and the pharmacies know about all of these, has anyone else experienced this?  Have any thoughts or know anything about what might be going on?  Just need to figure out if this is potentially something dangerous and I should go to the ER or something that my body is just noticing and will get used to.    


The information on Propranolol mentions that it can 'cover up the symptoms' of hypoglycemia including dizziness (a symptom of Propranolol), light headedness (also a symptom of Propranolol), and mentions palpitations being a symptom of hypoglycemia - though that's something that Propanolol can be used to treat.  How does it do that?  Just because a lot of the symptoms are shared and someone might suspect it's not low blood sugar but instead the Propranolol?  Or can it make low numbers look high?

&amp;#x200B;

A chance popped up to do the coke and I was like ""fuck it, sure"".  After we did the coke, my sister-in-law is like ""BUT WAIT... THERE'S MORE"".  And suddenly she produced some dope.

I have nobody to share this with because my entire family believes I'm this wonderful sober version of me who isn't drinking every day or randomly doing coke and heroin on a Tuesday night because fuck it.  I'm happy I did it and I'm now not sure if I want to make it a regular habit it again or just let it be a one time deal.

I was at a party with some people in the grade above me. I had been drinking some but not to the point of being drugged, and then took one hit of a glass gravity bong with what I presumed to be and was told was weed. At the time, I was a seasoned stoner and had probably been smoking every day for at least a year and a half. What happened next had never occurred to me when smoking previously, and has never occurred to me since, even when experimenting with mushrooms. Almost immediately  after I took the hit I could feel myself getting dizzy and the room started looking odd, like things rotating and moving almost like how things move when you’re on shrooms but way more disorienting and not really the same. I went into the bathroom with two other girls who had also taken a hit and looked in the mirror. I started to hallucinate that  changing into different animals and eventually I got stuck on a rabbit. Obviously I knew something was off but I didn’t know what to do as one of the girls in the bathroom with me was violently throwing up and the other girl was singing opera (this was very strange and not in normal behavior, I could tell she was in some kind of weird state). I got out of the bathroom and sat on a couch, basically immobile waiting for it to pass and watching things around the room appear bigger than they originally did and some appear smaller. Unfortunately then a boy came and asked to “show me the bathroom”. I was very aware of what he was actually trying to do and refused several times. Even though I was in a practically vegetative state I managed to say no for about 40 minutes upon which I gave in because he simply wouldn’t leave me alone. We went in the bathroom, started hooking up with the lights off on the floor. And I begin to have a completely out of body  experience where I literally was watching myself hook up with this boy from the perspective of the ceiling, completely dissociative for the entire event. Once he was done, I got dressed and left the bathroom I walked out and remember thinking everyone knew what had happened and became extremely embarrassed and unable to speak. Things were still moving microscopically and I was becoming increasingly anxious so I decided to go to  bed. I woke up the next morning feeling completely fine as did the other girls. I’m just wondering if the weed was laced. I’ve had many experiences with both drinking and smoking individually and together, and though I have gotten sick a few times I have NEVER hallucinated like that, and the other two girls who also smoked said the same thing.

I'm a 33 year old male. After years of struggling with ADHD symptoms I've been taking Elvanse (same as Vyvanse, which is lisdexamphetamine. A chemically delayed release of dextroamphetamine).

The medicine works great for me. Concentration has improved and my overall mood has been SO much better. I was functioning quite ok without meds, but everything has become so much easier after I've started regularly using my meds. While Dextroamphetamine gave me a huge crash at the end of the day, the slower releasing medicine I'm currently on seems to flatten the highs and lows (not great for recreative use but great for medical use!) 

Before I was on these meds I had been recreatively  using drugs such as Amphetamine, 2FMA, 2FA, 3mmc, ketamine, MDMA, LSD, 4-HO-MET. Basically I'd use drugs about once a month. Sometimes at parties (MDMA) or at home (LSD, Ket, amps).

I'm wondering what impact my daily lisdexamphetamine (30mg, equivalent to 12mg of dexamphetamine) would have on that recreatieve drug use.

I can image that amps and MDMA would be disappointing due to dopamine tolerance? Or am I overestimating the dopamine impact of MDMA compared to its (not impacted?) serotonine activity? I'm not expecting any impact on Ket and a limited impact on the psychs.

Unless you've been on a month long acid binge, or are on SSRI, or have a naturally high tolerance to serotonergic psychedelics (which is *extremelly* rare), you are either delusional or full or shit.

I experienced nearly full spectrum of effects on real 105ug (with the exception of ego death and OBE), and had my ass handed to me on real 220ug.

I'm saying *real* because prior to that, I've taken ""100ug"" and ""200ug"" dozens of times that were nowhere near these with the effects

There have been tabs that were claimed to be 150+ug with as little as 20ug (lab tested).

I'm writing this as an advice to all newbies wanting to try acid; I'd advise you to rather do 1p-LSD or 1cp-LSD; these are either prodrugs to LSD or have nearly similar effects, and you can get them on clearnet (provided ofcourse, they aren't outlawed in your country), and most importantly, 99% of the time, **doses are as advertised**.

I'm not saying there aren't trusted vendors out there, with properly dosed acid that *slaps*, I'm just saying there are lots of vendors who did get properly dosed acid that eventually lost its potency due to improper stashing/preservation while waiting to be resold (i.e. not a first hand).",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,692867,public,confidence,self,Lots of people here overestimate their doses,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hovu4f/lots_of_people_here_overestimate_their_doses/,no_ads,0.0,1594439397.0,,,,,Custom,14240396-9da9-11e5-9ca6-0e5d32eec499,Lysergamides,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't have any worries, doubts or questions I just figured the last 5 or so hours have just been very wholesome and I think we could all do with a few more light hearted storys these days.


It was originally just a Friday night pub night with the boys but the pub closed at midnight and we mostly still had the spirit to bender. We drunkenly walked and laughed out way to one of our houses to get some Molly and Ket then walked back to one of our bendering spots.

The night was already a lot of fun as two people who changed high schools around the second year were also there and so I hadn't seen them in about 5 whole bloody years!

We tried our hardest to put our spirit into the bender but some were too tired/drunk and my best friend we'll call H had a bit too much Ket earlier on and wasn't feeling up for a proper bender.

So the bender fell apart but I had already dropped some Molly and as H was going home it was hitting me. H just wanted to go home and watch a movie and keep warm and we agreed that it'd be cool and fun if I just rode my Molly out at his place and I could sort of tend to his needs like water or a bucket if he thought he was going to spew.

The next few hours were just pure deep talk about life. Just the two of us, literally both under the blankets and in his big bed together haha. H and I talked a lot about our dreams and learnt some new stuff about each other, which surprised us both as we've been best friends since we were about 7 years old.

As we both knew was coming, H eventually fell asleep and now here I am, just sitting up in his bed next to him and just thinking how grateful I am for him being a part of my life.

You can check out the post yourself from the link in the previous sentence if you'd like to read it.

Personally, I have no idea what to believe. I've never bought a test kit period so idk whether these guys are actually trustworthy or not. While that post certainly doesn't paint them in a very positive light though, I've seen a bunch of posts elsewhere where people who bought from them seemed pretty happy with their purchases so their kits seemed to work for them. Worst comes to worst, I'll just go with Dancesafe or Lunar Labs but EC is the cheapest out of the three of them so that's why they were my number one choice. However, if their kits don't work properly then I'll just pay more for ones that actually do from someone else since my safety is obviously more important than saving a little money.

I\'m hoping they will be accessible to a wider audience while maintaining their integrity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is still so so much to explore ! And there will always be so much to explore! This is by no means done, I still have a large backlog of substances I have found that I still need to investigate further and write about (Lophophine, 8A-PDHQ, Cryogenine, rare Diarylethylamines, Halogenated Tryptamines, HA-966, Indazole Tryptamines, Selfotel, Grayanotoxin, Traxoprodil, ZDCM-04, 7-Chlorokynurenic acid (maybe)), but I am definitely open to suggestions for others!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf any of you are interested in studying these further- please heed the warning at the top of each post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is what I have so far:  \n[Dioxolane Dissociatives](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/05/obscure-and-unknown-dioxolane.html) \\- (Etoxadrol, Dexoxadrol, WMS 2539, WMS 2508) A series of NMDA antagonists studied as anesthetics that demonstrated remarkable hallucinatory properties that led to them being abandoned and forgotten\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Benzomorphans](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/06/obscure-and-unknown-benzomorphans.html) \\- (Pentazocine, Phenazocine, Cyclazocine, Alazocine) An interesting series of drugs that act primarily as opioids, though they are likely also NMDA antagonist dissociatives. Interestingly, they act on the K-Opioid receptor similar to Salvinorin A, and case reports cite vivid open eyed visuals and dissociative-like effects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Halogenated Tryptamine Analogues](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/05/obscure-and-unknown-halogenated.html) \\- (Trifluoromescaline, 2-Chloromescaline, 2,6-Dichloromescaline, 2,6-Dibromomescaline) An interesting series of forgotten mescaline substitutions- Trifluoromescaline may be extremely long acting, while 2,6-Dibromomescaline seems to be intensely visual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Analgesic Psychotria Alkaloids](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/07/obscure-and-unknown-analgesic.html) \\- (Hodgkinsine, Psychotridine, Pscyhollatine) Psychotria is best known for P. viridis, which contains DMT. However, there are several species (most notably P. colorata) that have interesting analgesic properties, which (though not confirmed) seem to be attributed to mixed opioid-NMDA antagonist activity. Though these pend further testing, this may be a naturally occurring dissociative!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Butyl Tryptamines (Part 1)](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/05/obscure-and-unknown-butyl-tryptamines.html) \\- (MBT, DBT, NsBT, NtBT and 4-HO-DBT) Part 1 of a long post about the butylated route of tryptamine substitutions. Shulgin said ""Butyl is futile"", but many of these compounds seem active, though not exciting. It still warrants further investigation. Part 1 delves into some of the specific ones Shulgin tested and a further analysis of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Butyl Tryptamines (Part 2)](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/05/obscure-and-unknown-butyl-tryptamines_24.html) \\- (NBT, 4-HO-DiBT, 4-HO-DsBT, and other possible compounds) This is Part 2, where I look into Butyl tryptamines that Shulgin never worked with. I then go on to list out all of the possibilities for butyl substitution and make conjectures based on structure of which may prove to be the most interesting psychedelics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[PEA-NDEPAs](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/06/obscure-and-unknown-pea-ndepas.html) \\- (TMA-2-NDEPA, DMPEA-NDEPA, M-NDEPA, DOM-NDEPA) A bluelight poster synthesized and self-tested a series of phenethylamines with extremely bulky substitutions that ultimately resemble a lysergamide. Some appear to be very potent psychedelics!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Deliriants of the Edgewood Arsenal Human Experiments](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/06/obscure-and-unknown-deliriants-of.html) \\- (BZ, EA-3443, EA-3580, EA-3834, and EA-3167) These are drugs that should never be tried by people, they are anticholinergic deliriants that were developed by the U.S. military as potential incapacitant chemical weapons and tested on army volunteers. They are all extremely potent and long lasting, with one compound lasting up to 10 days.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[LAE-32](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/05/obscure-and-unknown-lae-32.html) Another one from the annals of the U.S. government, this lysergamide was briefly studied during project MKULTRA. It appears to be a much less potent lysergamide, dosing &gt;1 mg, with curious antipsychotic effects that weren\'t investigated further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tricyclic Arylcyclohexylamines](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/06/obscure-and-unknown-tricyclic_16.html) (PD-137889, PD-138289) What happens when the 2 main rings of an arylcyclohexylamine are constrained into a tight 3-ring structure? Potentially potent dissociatives that certainly warrant further investigation into substitutions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Tricyclic Tryptamines](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/06/obscure-and-unknown-tricyclic.html) (RU-28306, NDTDI) Some redditors may remember these unique highly potent ""psychedelics"" as very lackluster but I delve into them for the sake of looking at their implications within structure-activity relationships. RU-28306 particularly appears to be an odd sedative.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[2-MDP](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/05/new-frontiers-2-mdp.html) A simple little dissociative that resembles an anticholinergic. It has only been tested in animals but behavioral effects seem to be similar to normal dissociatives and it appears to have an odd long lasting stimulant effect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Ergometrine and Methylergometrine](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/06/obscure-and-unknown-ergometrine-and.html) Two lysergamides (one of which is actually a WHO essential medicine) with effects strongly reminiscent of LSA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Antibiotic Induced Hallucinations](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/05/obscure-and-unknown-antibiotic.html) A detailed look at the delirious hallucinations caused by common antibiotics. While rare, it is interesting that such a mundane drug can have such powerful hallucinatory effects! Definitely not one to try for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Aptiganel](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/05/obscure-and-unknown-aptiganel.html) An NMDA antagonist developed for treatment of stroke that was abandoned for its dissociative hallucinatory effects. The failure of this drug led to the collapse of the company that developed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Mefloquine](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2020/05/obscure-and-unknown-mefloquine.html) An antimalarial drug whose clinical trials were rushed. It was later discovered that it could induce powerful psychosis and deliriant hallucinations in some patients, sometimes permanently (!), which led to a series of murders and suicides. An catastrophic cautionary tale about rushing medical development.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CNS-5161](http://nervewing.blogspot.com/2016/04/new-frontiers-cns-5161.html) Another dissociative that was abandoned during its medical development for dissociative effects. This is actually the first one I wrote, like 4 years ago before reviving this project recently. Probably due for a rewrite as it no longer meets the standard of the other ones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo which of these do I think have the most potential for further study?\n\n\\-The Dioxolanes show a lot of promise as really interesting drugs, these are what I would most like to see researched further. They also have a lot of analogue-building potential.\n\n\\-Benzomorphans seem interesting too, though they may be dysphoric in their effects\n\n\\-The halogenated mescaline analogues all show promise\n\n\\-The Psychotria Alkaloids MAY be interesting but not enough data exists to say anything for sure right now. Further testing (and I mean lab testing, not ""testing"") must be done on them\n\n\\-The following Butyl Tryptamines: 4-HO-MBT, 4-AcO-MBT, 4-HO-MiBT, 4-AcO-MiBT, 4-HO-MsBT, and 4-AcO-MsBT, 4-HO-EBT, 4-AcO-EBT, 4-HO-EsBT, and 4-AcO-EsBT\n\n\\-PD-137889, PD-138289 show promise, and have a lot of possibility for active analogues through all sorts of substitutions\n\n\\-DOM-NDEPA, the DOM analogue of the PEA-NDEPA structure, and by proxy pretty much all of the DOx analogues of the PEA-NDEPA structure. This one was the most potent and had the most interesting effects.\n\n\\-2-MDP may be interesting too, animal studies show promise\n\n\\-CNS-5161 is also probably worth exploring further\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I would like to reiterate- just because I say these may be interesting, don\'t go out and just try them willy nilly! A lot of these should first be tested in as clinical setting as possible in as controlled a manner as possible, some absolutely need further lab tests before they should ever be administered in humans, and some should just not ever be taken by people at all. I hope this can open them up to further discussion and investigation!', 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My quarantine passion project has been a series on my blog I have been calling &amp;quot;Obscure and Unknown&amp;quot;, where I delve into medical literature and other sources to find interesting hallucinogens or prospective hallucinogens with scant records of human use.

This is actually the first one I wrote, like 4 years ago before reviving this project recently. Probably due for a rewrite as it no longer meets the standard of the other ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So which of these do I think have the most potential for further study?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-The Dioxolanes show a lot of promise as really interesting drugs, these are what I would most like to see researched further. They also have a lot of analogue-building potential.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Benzomorphans seem interesting too, though they may be dysphoric in their effects&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-The halogenated mescaline analogues all show promise&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-The Psychotria Alkaloids MAY be interesting but not enough data exists to say anything for sure right now. Further testing (and I mean lab testing, not &amp;quot;testing&amp;quot;) must be done on them&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-The following Butyl Tryptamines: 4-HO-MBT, 4-AcO-MBT, 4-HO-MiBT, 4-AcO-MiBT, 4-HO-MsBT, and 4-AcO-MsBT, 4-HO-EBT, 4-AcO-EBT, 4-HO-EsBT, and 4-AcO-EsBT&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-PD-137889, PD-138289 show promise, and have a lot of possibility for active analogues through all sorts of substitutions&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-DOM-NDEPA, the DOM analogue of the PEA-NDEPA structure, and by proxy pretty much all of the DOx analogues of the PEA-NDEPA structure. This one was the most potent and had the most interesting effects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-2-MDP may be interesting too, animal studies show promise&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-CNS-5161 is also probably worth exploring further&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I would like to reiterate- just because I say these may be interesting, don&amp;#39;t go out and just try them willy nilly! A lot of these should first be tested in as clinical setting as possible in as controlled a manner as possible, some absolutely need further lab tests before they should ever be administered in humans, and some should just not ever be taken by people at all. I hope this can open them up to further discussion and investigation!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'send_replies': True, 'spoiler': False, 'stickied': False, 'subreddit': 'ObscureDrugs', 'subreddit_id': 't5_38fqy', 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/ObscureDrugs', 'subreddit_subscribers': 7818, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'suggested_sort': None, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'thumbnail_height': None, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'title': 'I have been writing very detailed fully cited articles about extremely obscure hallucinogens from medical literature', 'top_awarded_type': None, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'treatment_tags': [], 'ups': 1, 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/ObscureDrugs/comments/hotpzg/i_have_been_writing_very_detailed_fully_cited/', 'user_reports': [], 'view_count': None, 'visited': False, 'whitelist_status': None, 'wls': None}]",/r/ObscureDrugs/comments/hotpzg/i_have_been_writing_very_detailed_fully_cited/,,,,,,,

Sure coffein has a few downsides too, especially when you had too much you get more tired than you already are, but coffein is more than enough to stay awake, or in my opinion at least. Also coffein is legal so you wont get in any trouble using it.

I mean amphetamines are way more useful to party hard, but when you just need to stay awake, that's another story.

**From Wikipedia: The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors** (CoSM) is a transdenominational church and [501(c)(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)) organization dedicated to the realization of a shared 1985 vision of the American artists [Alex and Allyson Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Grey) to build a contemporary public Chapel as 'a sanctuary for spiritual renewal through contemplation of transformative art' [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chapel_of_Sacred_Mirrors#cite_note-1)

One of my best friends, Steve, was approached about attending a full moon party by a coworker. He had never heard about the chapel before and decided to attend. He planned on only taking some molly but his acquaintances had brought truffles with them as well so naturally he indulged. He had quite the experience that he relayed to me which made me very eager to attend one of these parties. 

Fast forward a month and the day has come. I get home from work and Steve is already at my apartment talking to my roommate. He’s got that mischievous smirk I’ve seen on his face over and over through the years. Steve and I go back to kindergarten so you can image the shit we have done through the years. He is my drug partner in crime. We have tripped, snorted, and rolled many times before. He reaches into his pocket and throws a bag of molly at me. I had planned to only take a tab and a half of LSD at the party. I had never candy flipped before and so I was giddy with anticipation. 

We packed up and were ready to go to psychedelic church. At the last second, I grabbed a banana, an apple, and an orange. We contemplated getting food before we left but decided to just get on the road. So, we get to our shitty little motel room and decide to order a pizza. They said 30 minutes. We wait and I eat the apple, Steve, the banana. An hour and a half later, after a joint and countless phone calls with our dimwitted pizza driver, the pizza had arrived. He shows up and says “You should have told me you were blazin!” \*face palm\*

Our cab had arrived at the same time as the pizza so we dropped a tab and a half and agreed we should wait to eat the pizza until we got back.  

We pull up to this great big white house with sprawling grounds. The place is beautiful. It was a tripper’s paradise. Lots of grass and acreage to walk around, a laser show being projected onto the trees, a large fire pit with benches, a trip tent with tapestries and pillows and much more. The place has good vibes and the people who show up all share the same open mindedness. All different people from all walks of life were there and most were on some sort of drug. The stank of shwaggy weed and sage filled the air. The inside of the house is filled with Alex Grey’s incredible artwork. Shout out to [Cosmic Christ](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0935/8886/products/Cosmic-Christ---Poster---Alex-Grey_1800x1800.png?v=1571270282). 

Anyway, so after walking around the grounds a bit and sharing some weed with a few kind strangers, we both start coming up hard. The fire gets lit and I flutter to it like a moth. Steve and I are just in a trance watching the fire dance when I remember we need to eat the molly. We scurry away from the fire and take a seat in the empty trip tent. 

I very conspicuously halved the bag of unicorn dust into our hands. I licked my palm and i swear it hits me instantly. I think the lack of food contributed to this. We go inside for the first time. (Shoes off) It’s warm and inviting. I am tripping absolute balls. The entire house is like one big art exhibit. I was completely blown away by it. I just wandered from piece to piece, mouth agape with a smile. We spent a good long while doing this. The art is almost too intense for me as the peak starts to creep up my spine. I have to look away. According to Steve, I looked as crazy as I felt. The fire was calling us so we found our shoes and made our way to it. Stairs are hard on acid. I barely make it down them without falling.

A random guy at the fire calls us over and says “I saw you guys turbo boosting in the tent, got anymore?” This made me laugh so much as I’ve never heard this term. I sadly had to let him know that we hate eaten it all. He fist bumped me and told me to enjoy the night. 

At this point I needed to lay down and just close my eyes, so I did. I put my backpack behind my head and warmed my bones beside the fire. Steve joined me and we both strapped in for the peak. Everything at this point was very intense and I was starting to a get anxious. I remember saying to myself, “just let go, let go, surrender to it.” And I did. I kept my eyes closed for a long time and kind of went deeper and deeper until I went into a dream/trance. I remember seeing the entire contents of the universe being sucked into a box. It was like the box was a black hole and it was pulling everything into it. Then it felt I was entering a room and opening doors to the next one on repeat. Then POW! I saw the gun that Joker, from Batman, uses that shoots out the little flag that says POW! on it. This made me laugh hard, audibly, and come out of it. People around me most of thought I was nuts lol.

I remember thinking that all these questions that everyone is constantly trying to answer is ultimately meaningless. Life is just so absurd and incomprehensible. I opened my eyes and the greatest feeling of euphoria rushed over my body as I remembered that I had one. I felt so damn good. The laser light show was in full swing above my head and I just bathed in the glory of the trip. Behind me, a woman and a guy were in one of those deep talks about the universe, aliens, life, love, you know. I was really enjoying listening to them and when they stopped talking, I snaked my head around and said please don’t stop, I am loving this. They just laughed and we chatted for a bit. As the party was dying down, we called for our cab to pick us up. It was a different guy who picked us up. We got in and he asked us what we were doing up to here. Steve chimed in. “Were here for the full moon party and to look at the art!” The driver just kind of made a mmhh noise. 

A second later he goes “Yea, I’ve been up here I know what you’re doing” in a way that I did not like. I took this time to close my eyes and just vibe in the back seat. Halfway into the ride I hear the engine of this local cab driver’s shitty car start to rev. I open my eyes to this dude literally racing another car. I start to freak out a little and yell “Dude! WTF are you doing!” It felt like we were doing 90 when in reality it was like 40-50 mph. Steve just laughed at me. I was still a bit on edge when we arrived back to our motel. The driver apologized and said he knew these roads like the back of his hand. Whatever dude, super unprofessional so no tip for you! 

Safely back at the motel I threw on this onesie I got as a gag gift for Christmas. Steve didn’t know I had it with me so when I jumped out of the bathroom, we both laughed and laughed until it hurt. It was at this time I realized how god damn hungry I was, so I opened the pizza up. It did not look appetizing at all. Steve jumped in and started to eat it. I asked him how it was, and he said GOOD! I started to eat a slice but my mouth was so dry and the pizza too cold. THE PIZZA WAS IN FACT, NOT GOOD. When he saw my disappointed face Steve couldn’t control himself and with a face full of pizza mustered out “I knew it wasn’t good but you needed to eat something!” We both laughed for what felt like an eternity. I opted for the orange instead. 

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of the night we threw on some music, played with those [scratch art things](https://www.firstpalette.com/images/craft-mainpic-large/scratchart-main.jpg), did some yoga, smoked joints and just made each other laugh uncontrollably until the sun came up.

How is ethyl loflazepate compared to xanax? 
How much would it take to equal 0.5mg of xanax? (if it's possible to compare). 
From what I understood ethyl loflazepate lasts like 8h, way more than xanax and seems to be way less strong (?). 
Wouldn't take 0.5mg xanax at night as the doctor suggested fuck up the tolerance for the loflazerape very quickly? 
 How do they differ in terms of potency, anxiolytic properties, relaxation, recreational potential etc?

Starting in mid fall of 2019 my sister (19) and I (F20) started buying dab carts from a new dealer. I found him through a friend of a friend on snapchat. The carts were pretty cheap and I had limited money so it seemed like a good idea. We regularly smoked these carts everyday until early March. 

We spent most of our days waking up to immediately hitting the cart. We would hit it anywhere between 10-30 times a day each. The only time we took breaks was when we had no money, and the breaks never lasted longer than 5 days. We constantly craved the pen but we told ourselves we were just emotionally dependent on weed, nothing else.

It’s difficult for either of us to recall specific instances because the whole thing feels like a blur. But we know our symptoms.

We began to have severe mood swings and emotional outbursts at the slightest inconveniences. We attributed this to our stressful living situation. We had great difficulty recalling things from memory, whether it be 10 years ago or 10 minutes ago.  
Separately, we both became extremely depressed and anxious. We’ve both had a history of depression and anxiety in the past so at the time we assumed it was a regular part of our mental health cycle. But looking back we were much worse than ever before, even to the point of being suicidal. We were emotionally unstable and something as simple as not being able to zip up my jacket would send me to tears, and sometimes screaming. 

We became very lazy and unmotivated. Loading the dishwasher felt like taking the SATs again.   
We would hear people calling out our names or a knock on the door, that would turn out not to be there. 

We live with our parents and they began to notice our erratic behavior, often noting that we were high. They first noticed our slurred speech and blank stares. This surprised us at the time because we hadn’t noticed those symptoms on our own, and we never had these symptoms from smoking real marijuana in the past. We pushed away their worries as we felt valid in our behavior. Everything we did felt justified because we felt extremely anxious if things weren’t laid out the way we expected them to be. 

In early March, we completely ran out of money as neither of us had a job anymore. Desperate to get high we turned to the internet and heard about people getting high off of cough syrup. This seemed like a pretty okay idea, as we felt we needed to get high. We each took about 6-7 times the amount of the recommended dosage. 20 minutes in my sister began vomiting. We immediately realized we were headed to an overdose. I woke my parents and they drove us to the emergency room. I requested a drug test and it came back positive for marijuana and PCP. We instantly knew our carts had been laced. We were able to draw our previous symptoms to our usage of PCP but it took a few more months for us to come to terms (on our own, and then together) with the fact that we had been addicted. Since then, we’ve cut off contact with this dealer and we haven’t smoked since. 

After doing lots of online research about PCP, we didn’t come across a single symptom that we hadn’t experienced at one point or another. Many of them were constant. But we were in absolute denial that it was anything more than marijuana.

So what do we do now? We have no insurance, and we can’t ask our parents for help. I’m worried that if I did find my way to a doctor it might go on my medical history, and I might be denied certain medications that I need (I am taking necessary daily medication.) 

So that’s why I’m here. What are the possible short and long term effects of smoking PCP so often and for so long? Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated.

I have taken pregabalin as below:

5th July - 600mg - 6th July - 600mg - 7th July - 2250mg - 8th July - nothing - 9th July - 3450mg.

My excuse for taking it was that I've just quit kratom after about a 6 week Taper. I took my last dose on 1st July so 9 days clean today.

I don't get that much out of pregabalin (although it definitely cures any kind of kratom withdrawl symptoms) hence yesterday I just sorta kept taking it until it became too intense. Then I had a couple of beers and 0.5mg etizolam to sorta even me out and prevent any seizures. 

I had a bad headache yesterday and like a burning feeling in my head, although this could have been down to me missing my usual 15mg mirtzapine dose two days in a row as the burning feeling stopped after I took the mirtazapine, however the headache/migraine continued until I took 50mg Sumitriptan.

But yeah anyway I went off at a tangent there but would welcome any advice on whether you think the headache was kratom or mirtzapine related or even if it was pregabalin related (headache stopped before I took Pregabalin, it stopped after the Sumitriptan). 

But my main question is am I addicted to pregabalin, will I have withdrawals it I stop taking it now (was that headache or burning sensation withdrawals?).

Or can I safely carry on taking it for a bit longer? I will take either nothing or a low dose today and tomorrow but after that maybe higher doses.

This was the second time i tried weed, the first time i wasnt sure if i really got high cuz i couldve also been drunk. We brought a pipe to smoke weed but its not really like a weed pipe that i see pics of online it looked more like a meth pipe (wasnt used before). we put the weed on top of the hole and smoked it and we also smoked a joint after. it was like 10 mins and we didnt feel anything but suddenly everything was super weird. i started losing memory of what i did and did some stuff that i didnt think through. After 15 secs (or what felt like 15 secs) i would ""wake up"" and feel like i had been dreaming and completely forget everything i just did. the high was very strong when it first hit. everything felt zoomed out and then zoomed in. its hard to describe but it was really surreal. it felt more like a nightmare than a dream. my friends also began experiencing this. i remember i told my friend that the weed had to be laced with something because it wasnt normal, he said we were just super high and going on a trip but he said hed never had smth like this before. basically this whole dream-wake-up cycle went on for ages. at first time went by really slowly, it felt like an hour and we would check and only like a minute. After a few hours, time went by really fast and what felt like a minute was like 40 minutes. I remember I did a lot of dumb and dangerous shit (like trying to cut my finger off w scissors). i also remember everytime i looked out the balcony i thought abou jumping off because i was convined i was in a dream but a voice in the back of my mind knew it wasnt. i honestly dont remember most of the things that happened. this went on for a long time so i then tried to fall asleep so it would be over. after i fell asleep for a few hours i woke up and i was pretty much sober even though it was kinda still there. im basically just asking if this has happened to any of u before or if any drug experts know what drug can do something like this. idk if u really can get THIS high with one gram of weed shared b/n 3 ppl. also my eyes werent red, i remember my friends eyes were but mine were just a lil bit. anyway was this just some weird super high weed experience or could it possibly have been laced w smth. what type of drug has effects similar to this?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,692759,public,confidence,self,Was my weed laced?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/homqly/was_my_weed_laced/,no_ads,0.0,1594406601.0,,,,,Cannabinoids,,Cannabis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Me, one of my closest friends and his cousin decide to drop the L without giving it too much thought since both me and my friend are experienced users. His cousin was doing it for the first time so he did a smaller dose (100ug) while we both did (150/160).

First of all, if you're experienced with L you know that smoking weed before the peak can lead to some very intense experiences, its kinda like rolling a dice and hoping you land on a good experience instead of a bad/weird one.

My friends cousin didnt know all that much about acid so he suggests we smoke some hash since he wasnt feeling the acid, this was about 50 minutes in and I knew for sure that soon we would all be tripping hard. I advise against this, especially since its very potent hash but we end up smoking a big ass spliff between the three of us, ignoring my better judgement.

Now, it was a really hot summer day and we had a lake nearby, so as soon as the acid/hash combo starts doing its thing we all decide going into the lake was our ""little mission"". If you've taken LSD before, you know your brain can really get in the zone and all you do and think is the little missions you set for yourself.

5 minutes later we are all inside the lake and having the time of our lives, only to realize a couple of minutes later that it had LITERALY thousands of small leeches. Shit starts getting real when we get out and i ask them if I have any on my back, my friend says im fine and that i only have a couple that he can see, we get them off our feet and backs but thats when it hit us, leeches like to go inside people's assholes and live there for weeks.

After what seemed like an eternity of getting the leeches and paranoia off our minds we decide that we are all very fucked up and start going back to the farm house we had nearby.

A couple of more hash joints get passed around and the idea of getting into the water seems appealing again, since its so hot. But this time we had gotten smarter, there would be NO LEECHES this time around, so we walk to a smaller lake that was a couple of minutes away.

Mind you, this was when the LSD really started doing its thing where you start going into really weird loops of thoughts and its hard to get away from certain things, so the leeches were always on the back of my mind, wondering if I had some up my asshole that I didnt know off.

So, this new lake also had leeches, we only realised this after jumping in, as one does when under the influence of LSD (very normal for lakes to have leeches in my country this time of the year, especially in remote locations). After a couple of minutes my feet were full of leeches but this time I was actually tripping balls, it was almost like no matter how hard I tried I couldnt get them off me, and I started imagining the leeches sucking my blood and getting inside my skin.

Meanwhile my friend and his cousin decide to outsmart the leeches (their theory was that if you dont touch the lake's floor the leeches dont get on your feet/body) so they get a bunch of metal chairs inside the lake and start creating a path with it.

Its hard to paint this picture with just words but we had me, tripping balls scratching my feet for what seemed an eternity and thinking I had leeches inside my skin, and these two dudes, also tripping balls, trying to create a path of chairs that would take them to the middle of the lake, so they wouldnt touch the floor.

Long story short, they lose one of the chairs, spend hours trying to find it only to come back with minus one chair and a body full of leeches once again.

After this we just walked home, paranoid as shit that we had leeches up our assholes and with our heads full of acid, the rest of the trip revolved pretty much around smoking hash, listening to my friend play guittar and talking about how much paranoia we have towards our assholes.

I wouldnt call this a bad trip, it was just a weird one, i've had trips that felt a lot worse than this. Just felt like sharing the weird experience. 

TLDR: Took acid and smoked quite a bit of very strong hash, got inside a lake that was full of leeches, tried a different lake that also had leeches so paranoia kicked in and we all thought we had leeches inside of us.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,692742,public,confidence,self,Who knew LSD and Leeches dont mix,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hollec/who_knew_lsd_and_leeches_dont_mix/,no_ads,0.0,1594400323.0,,,,,Psychedelics,450b9864-9d47-11e5-bb1d-0ef44579b8c1,Psychedelics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The differences in each of them was so interesting. After trying all of their connects products I felt like there was a better experience somewhere else. I could tell it wasn’t decent cocaine based off the appearances of all their dealers. So I had asked a buddy of mine who always bragged that he had “the finest white China” if I could purchase his connects product and try it. He set up a meet and instantly knew this guy was the real deal. He was very professional and an older man. After talking and feeling each other out I purchased his product, went to my room and broke some up. Texture and dexterity was nice. The smell was almost not there but kind of sweet smelling. I took one line and I had found the holy grail.

I've taken this dose before, and its much less recreational than ketamine or dxm, but it has its own unique headspace. I like how it doesn't have much forced euphoria, so you still have to do thing's while you're dissociated and make it fun. Plus, it lasts about 24 hours, so you have lots of time to enjoy the dissociation. A few things i like to do on Memantine are

\+Smoke Weed

\+Walk outside

\+Play an open world game, and get sucked into it.

Somewhere just beyond the surface. Blissful ignorance emanated from him and coated all of the walls of his apartment from the ceiling down for a brief moment, giving it an air of grey tepid water that has been sitting too long in the open air. He could not stop himself from relieving the pain. The pain of being alone so long that loneliness is all that you have. Like a broken friend that keeps pulling you under tarry waters until you can have nothing but that same brokenness he has to offer. It infected him and burned out his nerves until he couldn’t feel anything anymore save the glassy pinpricks of unfortunate events that seemed to clutter the path he walked along. For the longest time he wanted someone to save him, and I think he still does. But not in the same way as before. He simply wants to undo the film that he finds suffocating him. The same film that everyone can simply see through, but that would be his demise if he allowed it to keep tormenting him. Unfortunately, the best he could manage were some miniscule punctures to let the bare minimum amount of air in to keep him alive. To keep him breathing, despite choking on every breath. To some, life is beauty unbounded by the constraints of mental trappings and imaging, leading to interminably fruitful endeavors. To others life is a stone; one that is so obstinate that simply by association, these same people turn into living caricatures of stones themselves. But that is the nature of things; beauty begets beauty, power begets power, and failure begets failure. If only there could be a source of light nearby that would seek to envelop and understand him rather than unmask what he had become. If only he didn’t just wish for more darkness. For no matter how much he willed for things to be different, his nature was what it was, and as surely as the setting sun tucks its head into the earth, his light had set long ago into the horizon of his mind and body leaving nothing but the detritus of opportunities missed, time lost, and people forgotten.

i’ve also got some nasal salve I could play afterwords to further reduce the drains of my nose. Anybody else have any tricks to reduce the clooge nose because it’s impossible for me like that. or maybe someone knows of any more scientific studies on exactly this problem or has some general information on this as well?

because if it isn’t really harmful I would absolutely love to continue using the nasal spray, but if anyone knows if this is really bad actually I’d love to hear some alternatives.

i’m sure I’m not the only one that’s his problem but I guess most people don’t question the (possible) harmfulness of these actions. really been able to found any similar threads on Reddit on this topic.

I'm in Year 12, and it's the time of year where major work due dates and exams are coming up. Up until this point I've always been the one to cruise through school quite easily, smoking weed and chilling out with my friends, not really caring much and procrastinating heaps. These past few weeks I've stopped smoking weed but I've replaced it with stimulants: coffee, so much fucking caffeine, nicotine, MDMA, Ritalin. 

My eating disorder and depression are suffering so much. I feel like my mental health is depleting, I've spent the past 3 days on Ritalin pumping thousands of words into these essays. Don't call me stupid for taking ADHD meds, I know its dumb and terrible for my situation. I know I'm capable of doing the work on my own, but I feel like I have no faith in myself. I'm a good student, get relatively high marks, but the perfectionist in me doesn't recognise this as an achievement at all. 

I'm not sleeping, not replying to friends, I feel so isolated right now. I'm walking straight into something I will inevitably regret. Each day I say, no more coffee, no more smokes, eat some damn food, don't rely on these meds, but I feel like I'm already stuck here, and fail every time. I am so anxious.

Don't really know where I can ask a question like this, so if you know of a better subreddit to ask this to don't be afraid to point me in the right direction.

I've been struggling with some serious chronic fatigue for many years now. Really don't know if it's from just general CFS, an autoimmune disease, or just the depression/anxiety/stress I had as a kid messing up my brain permanently.

It's always affected my life and how much I can really do, but just recently I was able to convince my Psychiatrist to prescribe me some Adderall XR because I've heard that stimulants can help people with constant fatigue like me. I've also always had symptoms of ADHD, but I'm not really diagnosed and it's not the reason I'm taking it.

I've taken 10mg, 20mg, and just today I was upped to 30mg. I was upped each time because I literally just don't feel anything working. I DO get side effects though for the first few days of each new dose (dizziness, nausea, shaking, etc. My body's pretty bad and fragile so I wasn't surprised) but then they go away and I just kinda feel a bit more hyper than usual, though I can't tell if its the Adderall, or because I've been outside more often (not in public, just the backyard) But even with that I don't really have any better focus or

I was just wondering if this is normal? What should I be feeling? Should I try asking for some other medication, and what other stimulants do you know of that would be good for fatigue?

Read the last paragraph.

Over the 4th of July weekend, I rented out a little rustic cabin with no electricity that was a short hike into the woods in a pretty rural &amp; isolated part of my state for the weekend. I really needed to get away from it all, but I also wanted to be in the perfect place to trip since it had been so long. I spent my time here alone. The first night I spent hiking around the nearby trails and relaxing, generally absorbing the sights and sounds of nature. It was incredibly tranquil and my life's previous stressors were of no worry to me here. On the second day I was feeling comfortable with my set and setting, so I took two tabs of LSD around 4:30PM. I ate some food beforehand so the come up took a while, but after about 90 minutes I started to feel that exciting psychedelic energy in my chest growing stronger and stronger.

Soon enough, that body energy began to feel uncomfortable and the trip was underway, so I went to lay down in my bed inside the cabin. I started out by listening to Phish's Fukuoka Japan show which is some of the trippiest music they've ever played. I don't have a very clear memory of what happened during this time; the combination of the LSD and the intensity of the music really turned my brain into psychedelic soup. I must have laid there for over 90 minutes. By the time they started playing their crazy Twist jam, I was finally feeling well enough to get up and out of the cabin. I went back outside and built a nice campfire while I listened to some more Phish and smoked a joint. I really was in the perfect place to trip. I was surrounded by a beautiful dense forest, and my cabin was right at the top of a small hill. I had a great view with a twisting creek at the bottom of the hill that had attracted a few deer during my stay. At this point, I was surprised the visuals weren't very strong. There was some minor breathing, the leaves in the trees sparkled just a bit, and I had what is best described as HDR vision; the contrast of dark lines against some lighter background were more apparent than ever. As much as I love visuals though, that wasn't the purpose of this trip.

Eventually the sun had set, my campfire had all but burned out completely, and I was left sitting there in the woods in the dark. Coincidentally, I was also at the tail end of Phish's 12/29/1994 David Bowie performance. For the uninitiated, this is a wild 35 minute jam, and in the end of it they start whispering and whistling cryptically over some spooky ambient synth soundscapes. That combined with the dark forest barely illuminated by the moonlight was an incredibly chilling experience. I'm sure most people would hate this kind of stuff, but somehow I just love to dive right into the spooky vibes when I'm tripping. It was fantastic.

Eventually I made it back into the cabin, where I started listening to Miles Davis' Bitches Brew in complete and total darkness, save for one small light on my bluetooth speaker that barely illuminated the objects in front of me. What an incredible piece of music that album is. The musicians all sound like they are fighting each other the whole time, but occasionally come together into some incredible jaw dropping grooves, only to fall back into a tug of war moments later. The production of the album is fantastic as well, instruments were panned so creatively that I could clearly picture all the different musicians on the table in front of me, launching their melodies at me from every direction. Visually, everything was taking on this cartoonish, Team Fortress 2 animation style appearance as well, for the few objects I could see anyways. I started to feel like I was transported back to the 1960s, visualizing colorful decor around me. I also started laughing hysterically about what I was doing in that exact moment. Did I really drive 7+ hours to lock myself in a remote cabin in the dark just so I could listen to my Miles Davis records in peace? Apparently so. I laughed hard about this concept for quite a while and have way too many recordings on my phone of myself trying to describe this concept, and failing miserably. 

At some point, I got pretty thirsty. I felt like I had a mouth full of hair and hadn't had a drink for the good 6+ hours I had been tripping. I went to grab a water bottle out of my cooler. This wasn't just any water bottle, mind you. It was filled with super clean well water hand pumped right out of the ground 50 yards away and chilled super cold on ice for the whole day. This was absolutely the most satisfying thirst quenching moment of my entire life. I cannot emphasize this enough. That one single satisfying gulp of water awakened a sense of environmental protectionism inside me. We must keep our water clean, we must keep our forests safe. It was all so beautiful and life essential, there is no other way. I still have a bottle of that water in the fridge too, its still delicious to this day.

Bitches Brew is a long album, but I managed to finish it. I followed that up with Ulver's Messe I.X-VI.X, which is an incredibly dynamic electro-symphony type performance. They're one of my favorite bands and this is one of my favorite albums of theirs, so it was a treat to listen to through a psychedelic lens. However, I was nearing the tail end of the trip by the end of the album. It was around 2:00AM, so I decided to call it night. I popped a Xanax which unfortunately did nothing to help me sleep like it usually does. The cabin was incredibly hot and I was very sweaty. I barely got a lick of sleep before having to drive home the next day.

The activity of the trip almost sounds boring looking back it, since I basically just listened to music and absorbed the beauty of nature for 10 hours, but it was very zen as a whole. What really made an impact was the effects afterwards. The trip in combination with disconnecting from society and losing my cell phone signal for a long weekend was an absolutely incredible spiritual awakening for me. Leading up to this, I was under a ton of stress because of COVID, the civil unrest around the world, and tons of pressure at work. I hadn't tripped at all in years either, since my trips started turning into a psychedelic light show and were losing the spiritual magic that means so much to me. I'm glad I went on this trip, because this weekend made a huge impression on me. By stripping away every connection to the outside world, every convenience in the modern world like electricity, showers, motor transportation, and eventually my mind via the psychedelics, I was able to focus on the bare essentials, psychologically speaking. As a result, I feel SO much more clear headed than I have in years. I feel much more satisfied in who I am as a person, my identity as a man, what capabilities I have, and my confidence in instilling the changes I want to make in my life. Life has been chaotic for the last 6 months to say the least, so its fulfilling as can be to dump all the wasteful bullshit occupying my psyche and focus on what really matters most to me. And that is exactly why I'm a firm believer in the power of psychedelics. I find the insights from these trips to be so deeply valuable to my growth as a person that I could not imagine the struggle of raw dogging life without them. Now I embark on the real challenge; using what I have learned from this spiritual journey and executing these lessons to build a more meaningful life for myself.

It's December 21st 2012, the Mayan End of the World, roughly 3 o'clock east coast time. Me and my three best friends from high school were home for Christmas break and we wanted to trip. We just got introduced into the psychedelic world in August 2012, and for me and my one friend, Fred, this would be our third or fourth 5 gram mushroom trip.

Fred had been renting a house with some dudes in his university town about two hours away from our home town. We decided to drive there as all his roommates had gone home for break, so it would be totally quite and private. His one roommate, Talon, was going to meet us there to trip too.

The guy driving, James, was always around as he didnt go away to school and stayed in our home town to work. Andre, had come back from school very far away so we didn't see him much as he usually spent summer break in his school city.

Since it was literally the darkest day of the year and we live in the north east of North America, it was pitch black on the drive. We were definitely all nervous and there was certainly an atmosphere of apprehension. Andre had never done a psychedelic before and James and Talon had never done 5 grams. Fred had been getting deep into Terence McKenna, so we had been infatuated with the idea of 5 grams in darkness.

As soon as we arrived we settled in to Fred's room with Talon already there. We scaled out 5 grams to each person in a cup, looked at each other, laughed a bit, and then everyone ate the sacrament.

Now the waiting game.

We browsed around that old site 8track (is that shit still around?) looking for a good playlist. About 30 minutes since consumption and we are all getting heavy. I had been sitting in Fred's office chair and I basically slid on to the floor, as the waves of psychedelia were coming faster and getting stronger. Talon chips in and says he knows a great playlist so we throw it on. Perfect. Fred flips the light switch and off we go.

At this point I can't say what was going on with the other guys, but my body felt incredibly heavy. I closed my eyes, lying on my back on the floor and crossed my arms across my chest like a mummy. I started to feel as though my consciousness was a piece of paper being folded together tighter and tighter, tighter and tighter, smaller and smaller, until everything was so small I felt like an atom. And then at the final fold, pop!

Oceans of colours and rainbows came cascading through the music in my minds eye. I had no conception of who I was, or what anything was. I had no feeling of having a body, only the feeling of a consciousness stretched across infinite space and time. Anything that was, I was there, as pure unfiltered consciousness. Waves of love sustained every breath in and out, but not breaths of a body, breaths of reality.

After a very long period of this experience, I came to this black space inhabited by a monstrously large eagle, with tribal native American features. It was bigger than any skyscraper I've ever seen. It had this neon green and black shine, similar to the northern lights. At this point in my life I had been an atheist, and was frankly quite scared of death, scared of my own mortality, and depressed at the cold emptiness of reality that I perceived.

The eagle explained to me nonverbally that all of reality is love, that there is absolutely nothing to fear in life or death, that death is simply an illusion, and that the universe is far more amazing and mysterious than I am aware. I felt this message so strongly and powerfully that the eagle disappeared after it knew I had understood.

As the music continued the cascades of psychedelic colour returned and I regained awareness of my body. I rolled over for the first time in what must have been hours and saw my friend Andre lying beside me. In the past there had been some pretty big tension between me and Andre, and there was a period where I really resented him, and I know he felt the same towards me. But when I saw him and felt his presence, I was hit by this huge realization that he's exactly like me. That he grew up pretty much the same way, and ultimately wanted the same things I wanted. I felt tremendous love and compassion for him and I wanted to give him a huge and apologize. But I could feel he was feeling the same things towards me too. (If you're reading this Dre, I love you man)

By now at least four hours had passed, maybe 5, and breaks between waves were getting longer, with each wave less intense. Some laughter came on the playlist, and the five of us all laughed at the same time. Then we laughed again at all of us laughing. And then we had this strange experience of telepathy, where we were all inside the same head, knowing exactly how everyone felt, being one together. And then some of us sighed, and some of us laughed in astonishment, as this transcendent Truth dawned on all of us simultaneously. Someone said, 'Money', but none of us know who, so maybe it was the mushroom. And for the first time in any of our lives the banality and triviality of the rat race seemed blaringly pathetic and stupid.

Another hour or two passed, and eventually we started asking each other if we were 'back'. Someone flipped on the lights. Andre was crying and he obviously had his reality blown in a great way. We started smoking weed and the weed smelt incredible. To this day, there's no better feeling and no better smell than weed after a transcendental mushroom trip. It was just after midnight, we were all worn out. We talked and laughed but everyone was still digesting what happened. It was clear everyone just experienced the most important thing that would ever happen in their life. We all found a bed or a couch and went to sleep.

In the morning the world was still there. I had got a text from a girl I had been in love with all through high school, asking me if I wanted to go out on a date. We'd end up dating for four years which would change my whole life. Fred and I would go on to have many more psychedelic trips, many of which were life affirming and changing.

Anyway, that's still the single greatest trip of my life 8 years later and that eagle is still burned in the front of my mind every waking moment. All the best, psychedelic homies 👍",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,692651,public,confidence,self,December 21st 2012 Trip Report: 5 grams Mushrooms,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hodg42/december_21st_2012_trip_report_5_grams_mushrooms/,no_ads,0.0,1594364568.0,,,,,Custom,,Long Post,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I crushed it with a razor snorted it in about 3 separate lines with a bill and it burned like a bitch for a good minute. 

Cut to 7 minutes later and my head is spinning. I thought it would mellow me out but instead it seemed my body was trying to drag me under. I staggered to my bed as my legs felt like lead, and yet I couldn’t quite fall asleep. 

So instead I’m lying there feeling so half conscious that I might as well be tripping. I eventually knock out, and then wake back up, thinking I slept a full night, at 3am.

I was always a bad role model doing drugs myself, normalising violence and drug dealing and I showed little regard for risk. I was selfish and put myself first. I prioritised money over family 

I pushed him away when he misunderstood my concern about his drug abuse for me just being mean. I didn’t listen to him and I dealt with it all in the wrong way. I tried to solve everything by pushing money at the problem and I should of tried to help earlier. What hurts me the most is he would of helped me out, I know he would of but I couldn’t help him and I’m supposed to be his older brother.

Then how did I deal with his death ? Conspired to kidnap the drug dealer and assault his friends, never went through with it though thanks to a close friend. That’s the only way I knew how to respond and that’s the mindset I taught him, if I had just acted like a normal person on occasion maybe he wouldn’t of passed before his time. I’m honestly only seeing now where I went wrong but obviously it’s too late now, don’t  wait if you know someone who is getting dependant on something or you’ll regret it for the rest of your life.

Peregrina contains an array of tryptamine compounds with the most prevalent being Bufotenine (5-HO-DMT up to 7.838%) with insignificant amounts of others like n,n-DMT and 5-MeO-DMT. The ancient snuff preparation method allows for the most bioavailability since traditionally the crushed seeds were heated with slacked lime allowing for a crude freebasing extraction using primitive tools. Since little information exists of the nature of the alkaloid fatty acids which are contained in the beans, I took a shot in the dark and discovered the following.

PROCEDURE: 3.803g of crushed A. Peregrina beans were crushed (roughly 300mg of Bufotenine if we assume full 7.8% concentration). To this is added approximately 2.75g of sodium carbonate. This is thoroughly incorporated and then small portions of 10mls of water are added with a glass dropper to thoroughly wet the dry mix. This is stirred and gently heated on a hotplate where CO2 production is evident upon stirring with a glass rod. This is reacting 2 molecules of the fatty acid salt forms of the tryptamine alkaloids, tannins, and oils found in the bean with one molecule of sodium carbonate forming the sodium salt of said fatty acids and releasing the freebase forms of the prior mentioned components. In addition this evolves 1 mole of water and 1 mole of CO2. As the bubbling decreases, the hotplate temp. is gradually increased and the water is boiled off to yield a spongey cake. To this is dripped acetone using a dropper to clean the sides of the beaker. The sponge is mixed with the acetone which turns deep amber as it dissolved the freebase alkaloids. This us then mixed to a paste, spread thin, and gently baked off in an oven at 125°C. Once a dry crumbly cake, it is broken into coarse powder and weighed. 

FINAL RESULTS: The coarse powder weighed in at 6.243g indicating a loss of 0.28g compared to the starting weight of the combined sodium carbonate and crushed beans. Since the weight lost as gas contains equal portions of water and CO2, this indicates 2.257mmol of each gas or around 0.208g of CO2 and 0.085g of water.

Using basic stoichiometey we can crudely determine that about 0.5g of the 2.75g reacted with the 3.803g meaning for every 300mg of extractable bufotenine worth of A. Peregrina seeds (or about 4g) add half a gram of sodium carbonate and this should be fully consumed by the acidic components in the beans. The acetone should have pulled out the freebase alkaloids and left them behind on the surface of the bean and carbonate matter. It would burn to snort as the left over 2.2g of sodium carbonate is caustic but benign to heat so the powder should be smokable. Will update if I try that...",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,692623,public,confidence,self,A.

I weigh about 170lbs if yall care.\n\nIntro:\n\nI woke up and decided that I wanted to trip today. I just got new LED lights for my room, so I wanted to watch them while tripping. After I woke up I showered, shaved(I hate facial hair while I trip), brushed my teeth(clean yo teeth fools), and decided to drop.\n\nT+ 0:00: \n\nDropped a tab and took a hit off of my weed pen. This is more of a recreational trip, but it is my first report.\n\nT+ 0:18: \n\nSwallowed the tab, and took another hit off my weed pen. I am very curious to see how weed affects my comeup. So far I just feel relaxed from the first couple hits. -- I still got a fair bit of anxiety during the comeup. I thought the weed would help with that but I guess not. --\n\nT+ 0:25: \n\nEverything is starting to feel kind of smooth and slimy. I get this effect every time I comeup on acid.\n\nT+ 0:36: \n\nSlight auditory enhancements. The music definitely sounds better. Also starting to feel a little nauseous. There is a slight euphoria, I'm gonna guess this is from the weed.\n\nT+ 0:42: \n\nAnotha hit from da weed pen. It feels very good to stretch now. My toes are cold. It's probably vasoconstriction from the lsd. Oh and I started yawning. I don't remember yawning during my other lsd comeups but I heard it can happen.\n\nT+ 0:50:\n\nMy jaw is starting to feel tighter. I do not like this feeling but I have experience with acid and molly so it's not unfamiliar. I think the visual enhancements/hallucinations are beginning... The colors seem brighter.\n\nT+ 1:00: \n\nYawning pretty often now. My stomach feels a little weird. And I feel kind of restless. I'm cold so I'm gonna go outside for a little bit.\n\nT+ 1:07: \n\nIt felt nice to go outside. While I was out there I started to get feelings of anxiety. I feel this every time I come up on acid.

Every shroom trip was an eighth, and 3 lsd trips were 1 tab. My last trip, a week ago, was my first time on 2 tabs. I smoke everyday so I have some tolerance to weed. I weigh about 170lbs if yall care.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intro:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up and decided that I wanted to trip today. I just got new LED lights for my room, so I wanted to watch them while tripping. After I woke up I showered, shaved(I hate facial hair while I trip), brushed my teeth(clean yo teeth fools), and decided to drop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T+ 0:00: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dropped a tab and took a hit off of my weed pen. This is more of a recreational trip, but it is my first report.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T+ 0:18: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Swallowed the tab, and took another hit off my weed pen. I am very curious to see how weed affects my comeup. So far I just feel relaxed from the first couple hits. -- I still got a fair bit of anxiety during the comeup. I thought the weed would help with that but I guess not. --&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T+ 0:25: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything is starting to feel kind of smooth and slimy. I get this effect every time I comeup on acid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T+ 0:36: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slight auditory enhancements. The music definitely sounds better. Also starting to feel a little nauseous. There is a slight euphoria, I&amp;#39;m gonna guess this is from the weed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T+ 0:42: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anotha hit from da weed pen. It feels very good to stretch now. My toes are cold. It&amp;#39;s probably vasoconstriction from the lsd. Oh and I started yawning. I don&amp;#39;t remember yawning during my other lsd comeups but I heard it can happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T+ 0:50:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My jaw is starting to feel tighter. I do not like this feeling but I have experience with acid and molly so it&amp;#39;s not unfamiliar. I think the visual enhancements/hallucinations are beginning... The colors seem brighter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T+ 1:00: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yawning pretty often now. My stomach feels a little weird. And I feel kind of restless. I&amp;#39;m cold so I&amp;#39;m gonna go outside for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T+ 1:07: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It felt nice to go outside. While I was out there I started to get feelings of anxiety. I feel this every time I come up on acid. Meditation helps me the most with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;T+ 3:00: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still coming up on the acid. The visual hallucinations are absolutely incredible.

From there I remember I almost passed out and told my friend to call a ambulance and sitting down trying to calm myself down. I dont remember how I got back home now that I think about it.
I remember it fucked me up mentally a lot though; I posted it on the trees subreddit but they all said there’s no such thing as laced weed and I thought that was the case too; until I found out there a few articles in my country where police found a lot of weed mixed with methadone, I got curious and looked into it and the symptoms are the EXACT same; panic attacks, breathing problems, losing motor functions and blacking out.

My surgeon (different hospital) knows about my past and made it sound like I won’t be getting pain killers. I need painkillers. Not because I want to abuse them ... I mean, I will abuse them, but I’ll mostly use them for pain. 


Are there any work-arounds? Can I talk to somebody else? Is there a way to convince my doctor to give me opiates instead of ibuprofen when I leave the hospital?

Now that my university is only online this Fall and I’m already behind, I just don’t want to do it anymore. It seems pointless. I think taking a tab by myself would really help me work through this stuff but I haven’t ever taken that much or done this alone. 

Are there any tips or advice any one that’s experienced can give me? In my current life situation is this a terrible idea?

The acid must have really gotten to my head at that point because I forgot who and where I was, I forgot I was on acid, I couldn’t remember how I got there or how we started, I just knew I was into it and I was really turned on. After that we chilled on the couch while he played video games, and this is where I had the urge to drive and see other people, which my boyfriend had to convince me not to do. I was really giving him a hard time, I really wanted to drive his car (i dont have a license) but he talked me out of it in the end. We ended up going back inside and watching Breaking bad, and here’s where things got weird for me. 

At this point we were riding the comedown and I started feeling really weird, especially watching that show, which isn’t really my vibe on acid, I was watching them clean up the partially dissolved dead body so it was a little weird. I had just taken a dab so the weed high was stronger than the acid high, which I think fooled me into thinking the acid was a lot weaker than it was. It was still in my brain, but I otherwise felt normal, and I tried to shake the feeling but I was feeling off. I was looking back on the trip and realizing how little I remembered. There were so many gaps in my memory that I started to get confused and worried about myself. It really got to me because my boyfriend has been talking to me about my weed habits and how damaging they can be, how it can fuck my memory and make me slower. It really scared me when he said he noticed I was getting dumber. Thats honestly why I was thinking about all of it in the first place. 

It was good timing, because things were winding down and I was feeling sleepy, so my boyfriend was putting me to bed. This was when I got pulled into a bad trip. I remember feeling so disconnected from him as I was thinking about all of the confusion and memory loss, as well as feeling bad about wanting to go drive his car and stressing him out like that. I also got into a knot because at this point I was trying to briefly explain to him what I was feeling, trying to brush it off as the acid just fucking with my head, but I could barely put into words what I wanted to say, which scared me even more because I felt trapped in my mind and thoughts and felt like my true thoughts could never be expressed, making me permanently alone. That’s a terrible, terrible fear for me. But the rational part of me knew, that the best thing I could do at that point was go to sleep and not talk about it. It was almost like if I told my boyfriend what I was thinking about, it would become real and only intensify. So I rationalized with myself, shoved the thoughts down and went to sleep. Which I’m really proud of. 

So overall I had a great time, but at the end reflecting on the trip I realized how little I remembered and how delirious I really was, I felt like I was losing myself and rotting my brain and I was afraid. Feeling trapped in my own thoughts and feeling guilty and confused. I don’t know

I think all that happened is I took a lot of acid with too much weed, it all became a blur, and at the end I started overthinking my experience and fell into a mini bad trip.

I’m not pretty good at calculating whats A LOT for ice, because I’m used to smoking up weed. I don’t know shit bout it so.. it was just rip after rip on the bong and I’m “somewhat” a first timer so the high felt really different from what I’m used to so I was willing to rip some more in one sitting. We basically smoked up all the way till the next afternoon when he left, and today I just had the worst fucking trip/withdrawal ever. 

I was walking to the living room when I suddenly lost consciousness and when I opened my eyes.. my face and my knee was bruised and I was on the fucking floor. I literally tripped on my chair and fell and I didn’t even remember it happening. This shit kept happening to me, for about 5 times today, whenever I stand up I’ll collapse. Probably because of my low blood pressure but it has never been this fucked up and recurring before. 

I hallucinated some weird shit twice, one where I was head banging to loud unbearable one continuous note, but apparently according to my room mate, I was just fucking unconscious. The second one was when I was trying to get to the toilet when I hallucinated kissing a silhouette for like the longest time and it was so intense it felt like my brain was about to fucking explode. My roommate told me I was making weird loud noises. What the fuck was that? I didn’t eat for two days so my vomit was basically just water, but the nauseating feeling wouldn’t stop so I forced vomited myself. Started sweating like a pig but I was fucking freezing for some reason, I was shivering. (It was probably like 26 degrees outside) It hurt so bad... 

I decided to take a nap because I was so fucking exhausted, and woke up about 3-4 hours later a lot better. 

Apparently, my friend just told me I had a fucking meth overdose. Looked it up, all of the symptoms occured to me. Expect for death ofcourse... Thank God. But now my heart wont fucking stop beating so fast, and I don’t want to go to the doctors. I also don’t have any weed left for now... So any advice on chilling my heartbeat out? Cuz my chest hurts.

Earlier today I disloacted my right shoulder for the fourth time so I knew the routine. Went in to the emergency department, got x-rayed and finally got the Penthrox inhaler. After a few puffs everything started going blurry along with every sound including my breathing constantly echoing out but never getting quieter. It really is a unique drug. Granted I've only tried a handful of drugs but I still know that it is such a distinct and weird high but still fun. 

Anyways I feel it kick in and in less then a minute my shoulder is popped backed in without me even realising, feeling or even being aware of anything aside from the sounds. Afterwards they left the inhaler on the table and even though it wears off unbelievably fast I was still doped up so I went up to the table and slipped the inhaler in my pocket. I know it was stupid and I regret it but they didn't even notice. Anyways I get back home and remember that I have it so I bring it to my room and notice these black beads in a small plastic tube. 

Mainly asking out of curiosity because I can't find anything on the internet and I'm just so confused as to what the fuck these things are.

Oh and if your curious yes I did use the inhaler again but I think it doesn't work as well without the actual canister of the chemical inside the inhaler much like a regular inhaler (obviously). And yes I did feel the effects but no where near as strong. 

I know I was stupid for stealing it but I'm only here to find out what's the purpose of those black bead things in the little plastic tube on top of it and also to hear other peoples experiences with this drug.

Funnily enough the nurse described this Penthrox as an anesthetic mixed with a hallucinogenic so that was surprising.

I look at drugs and think that they're a waste of money and ultimately a means to an end. They make you content when you shouldn't be. Why should you feel good if you're in a bad place in life? I honestly think it's refreshing to feel bad at times and be completely aware in the moment on how to fix it without the use of external stimulus. Being content when you shouldn't is so destructive in my opinion because you're not fixing your problems, you're just masking them. Even if you're in a good place and happy in life, I don't see why you'd want to keep on getting high when life has so much to offer than altering your brain chemistry. I don't judge anyone for using, and I think that they can be a great experience to open your mind to other things, however, I don't really agree that people should keep on using for months / years on end. I think drugs should be an experience, not a lifestyle and I think that ultimately people should grow out of them eventually. Again, I'm not judging anyone's choice of using because we all have free will, I'm just more and more repulsed by the idea as time goes by.

Then took them out and scraped the outer whiteish looking surface till it was wood brown and soaked them back in lime and honey juice.

Put that stuff in my mouth and was grinding the stuff with my molars making sure that I didn’t swallow it. Squished it around my mouth for 15 minutes and then spat it out.

As a note I was tripping like I was on 100 micro grams of LSD but was also feeling tired and wanted to lie down. My heart was beating faster than usual. Thoughts were more centred and I had a different perspective on thing.

For example I went to take a piss and thought it was such a waste to flush down such little piss with so much water. Not something I thought of after being alive for so many years.

I did this alone because at this point in time I don’t have people that I can trust with a psychedelic experience, but I trust myself though so with a lot of hesitation I decided life’s to short to wait for the perfect people to trip with. I’ve had experience tripping with drunkards and the amount of unconsciousness I saw made me feel uncomfortable.   
Psychedelics in my experience raises my awareness and watching humans behave like that is a 100% bad trip, have had that experience on acid before.

Do I wish I had highly accepting and conscious people to trip with. Sure, but then I also needed to drop my guard within myself and HBWR solo-tripping helped with that a bit.

But a warning, this stuff is quiet powerful and even though I experienced a mild eco-death it was none the less psychedelic. So if you think you can handle the strongest of THC and that this will be an easy one then I’d say start with 4 seeds and test the waters.

Anyway. 

Last year I took my daily dose of 5HTP (tends to be quite high although I've forgotten it now as don't need it anymore) and in the afternoon took what was supposed to be 150mg MDMA.  Naturally I got fucking BLASTED into space, which triggered a weird manic compulsive redosing that I've never had with MDMA before.  I'll assume the 5HTP was the cause.  I probably ate about 500mg and it was really potent stuff. 

Naturally I don't remember much of the roll - I never do with serotonergic drugs anyway - but I also don't remember much feeling wrong (ofc I didn't I was mangled) until about five hours in.  Bizarrely before that 5 hour mark nothing felt amiss. 

I know a lot of harm reduction (ironic right?) so upon realising my grave error and how much MDMA I'd randomly eaten I was using cold baths, cool towel presses etc to keep cool and felt relatively fine beyond a weird lack of sweat even though I was hydrating with electrolytes etc.  

My symptoms initially were headache / nausea / feeling cold then hot / strong dissociation (so fortunately I was able to not panic) / blue toes, purple knees, pale extremities (I'm prone to this anyway as have Raynaud's) / tight leg muscles like a cyclist's calf / knee pain / tremors / diarrhea / lack of pee / delirium; for example I clearly saw a tick randomly bite me and believed it for days til I realised it was a hallucination.

Not ideal but to be expected with too much serotonin.  However only ONE part really confused me and I hadn't read anything about. 

Partial blindness. 

This was the weirdest shit ever.  It wasn't just your usual blurred vision, barcode vision or nystagmus going overtime.  I literally could not see in front of me, it was just a big black mass with pink and green vibrating lines on the outline.  I was holding a spliff for example (weed cools me down, so felt appropriate and did ease symptoms down a little) and couldn't actually see it only a white and black fuzz with again, bizarre outlines.  Kinda like I'd just been thrown into an animation scene from Into the Spiderverse.  

I had vision in my periphery although it was again plagued with hallucinatory pink/green. 

I've had my fair share of psychedelics and MDA delirium so I KNOW things can get wacky (I watched my leg hairs grow back on MDA 🤣) but I don't believe this to be a hallucination at all.  I was practically partially blind as if the centre of my vision was dying or something obstructed the lens (the latter of which not being possible as far as I'm aware).  There was an aura kinda like a migraine, perhaps, but a literal total lack of centre vision was insane. 

Why might an excess of serotonin cause that?  I was fine the next day beyond a little sweaty, tired and dehydrated.  The comedown wasn't even terrible.  So what on earth made me go practically BLIND? 

I've not heard of it before so would love even just *theories*

I have no opiate tolerance and i have taken oxycodone twice now. And i don’t feel the urge to take more i dont feel some urge at all. It was the best high i ever experienced  but i still don’t want more. Might be becuase i have read storys of how it destroys life so easy.

But the crazy part is when i first tried oxy i took 15 mg waited 1 hour felt nothing. I have taken tramadol 400mg, codeine 120mg, but never felt no effect at all. So i read that you can have a natural tolerance or some genetic thing that makes you need more .alot more then the normal dose. So after the 15 mg i redosed whit 20 mg felt nothing and then i went on. I took a 30-45 minutes between redose to be safe. Until i was up in 160mg and then i felt high. I get that it might be cuase you need to take it all at once but i could not just guess my dose.

So the next time i did oxy i made it ir whit the coca cola method. I took around 25mg first then 25mg more and then redosed till i was up in 100mg. So i have natrual tolerance or lack of the enzyme that breaks down oxy.  Im very lucky tbh cuase if i got in to a addiction there is no way i could afford it.

If my stumic is bad at metabolasing the oxy would i metabolis it faster if i snorted it? Or does  it not matter cuase its becuase of the enzyme or stummic metabolism",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,692551,public,confidence,self,Not addictive personality,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hnznns/not_addictive_personality/,no_ads,0.0,1594313168.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So I get there and tell my friend I want to try them, he’s down. So he hits up the dealer but it takes him forever to serve us. I wanted to trip during the day but we didn’t get the shrooms until about 10pm.

We took them around that time, and I couldn’t bear the taste so I took them with peanut butter. We were in a relatively smalI apartment and I was tripping with my friend and we had a small german shepard puppy with us who was a little wild (he has a big part in this story).

It’s around 11:00 and I hadn’t really felt anything yet. 
I went to go take a piss, and while I was pissing the lights in the bathroom turned on and off 3 times consecutively, This kinda flipped me out so I went out and asked my friend if he was fucking with me, he said he wasn’t and told me how he was sitting on the couch the whole time, and I believed him bc he’s not the kinda guy to pull dumb pranks like that.

Shortly after I was watching my friend play cod, and I was feeling different but definitely wasn’t fully tripping, this was around 12am. My friend asked me if I could take the puppy outside, and my whole view on the dog was “we’ve got to take care of him, he is a puppy and needs our protection” So I let him out, outside is only lit by the front porch light, everything around the house was dark. I felt the cool breeze of air while I was watching the dog and telling him ”okay go pee buddy” 

This is where I feel that my bad trip started.

After the pup finished peeing he starts walking around  towards the side of the house, where it was very dark. I remember saying “no, no don’t go that way! Come here buddy let’s go inside” the pup didn’t listen to me, as he walked around the house into the darkness, as I started following him he yelped, almost as if he was being attacked. He ran out towards me and headed straight for the door, I ran with him, fearful of what creature lied on the side of the house. 

I let the dog inside and in a panic asked my friend if he heard what happened, he said yes. After this moment I’m in a state of slight distress.

I try to relax myself and just watch what’s on tv, the puppy however keeps trying to bite me(playfully but to me it was unpleasant) I decide to get up so the pup would leave me alone and walk towards the kitchen, I look at the clock and it’s 12:30. 

This is where my loop started. 

In the next section I’m going to try and explain the loop the best I can

1) I would look at the clock in the kitchen, and say something about how time was moving slowly.

2) I would sit on the couch, and try to watch whatever was on tv, feel uncomfortable and try to lay down, realize that laying down on a couch didn’t make me feel better, so I’d ask my friend if I could go lay in his bed

3) go upstairs and lay in his bed, think “okay I’m tripping and none of this is real, I’m just fucked up”

4) would turn the light off and then back on

5) tell myself that at 7:30 I would be okay again

6) I thought my friend would think that it was weird that I went upstairs 

7) go back downstairs and ask if my friend was good


And then the loop would repeat after that. But every time it was different 

On what felt like the 8th loop, as I was sitting on the couch I started to think that my friend was satan, and that he was going to torture me with this endless state of doing the same thing. And then at some point I thought he was god and that at 7:30 I would be dead and he was slowly taking me to heaven. And I got really really happy, because I thought I was meeting god, then as I proclaimed that my friend was god he told me he wasn’t, and then I thought I was in hell again and that he was satan, making me believe that I was going to heaven.

After a little I ended up on the couch again, my friend was upstairs but felt that he needed to be away from me bc I kept thinking he was satan(good call on his part). 

Then he comes back down to check on me, and all the sudden he says “MATT, MATT! BRO COME HERE”

I turn around and I’m like “what?”

And he’s standing next to the bathroom door, it’s closed. The lights behind the door are turning off and on again, the same way they were before I was tripping.

So I started feeling like I wasn’t real, or I was dead, or that I was going insane. 

And it was fucking terrifying.

I sat on the couch and just started crying, thinking that I would be going insane for the rest of my life, constantly going back and forth on what was real and what wasn’t. Then all the sudden, at around 4:30 in the morning I snapped out of it. I got sucked back into reality. My friend was asleep, but I heard voices outside, thinking I was tripping again I walked out to investigate. It was the neighbors who were friends with the guy I was tripping with, I talked to them about my experience and they told me that I had a bad trip and it happens. It really helped, because I knew it was real.

But after that experience I am kind of scared to trip again, I think I need to get some shit right in my life, including fear of death/ unknown. Because next time I do drugs I want to enjoy them, and not feel like I’m in absolute hell.

I’ve always been a poly-drug abuser since the moment I hit high school.

Now it’s gotten to a real bad place. I have no money, no job and I’m in debt to, and keep hurting the ones I love. 

I come from a family of extreme addiction. Grandfather was helplessly addicted to alcohol and cigarettes (my main 2 I’m using now), my aunt was addicted to opiates and OD and died, my father is a alcoholic but he’s functioning at least, and my uncle was addicted to benzodiazepines.

Now here I am. Guilty of all these substances and more. I have interviews lined up all this week and I’ve worked odd jobs to sustain my addiction but I have yet to land a solid position anywhere.

The only reason I’m not being sent to rehab immediately is because most of the harder drugs (coke, speed etc) are a good year in my past and my alcoholism and nicotine addiction have been less “in your face” you could say in terms of being strung out and obviously using.

Today I was caught with a fresh pack of cigarettes, wasted on cheap liquor in my backyard by my mom after giving the whole “It’s my last bottle/cig” speech the day before. “Today it ends” she told me. Rehab or Narcotics Anonymous immediately. I chose NA.

I’m scared and confused about what my future holds. I’m self aware enough to know I have many problems and I’m gonna try to take NA serious and make changes while I continue the job search.

There are 3 NA places in my area and I will be testing out one session each to see which I like best but I’m so anxious about it. I’ve never addressed my problems in such an upfront way before.

If anyone has advice for me moving forward and advice on NA or anything, please comment. I will read them all no matter how long they are. I hope I can at least use NA to make a couple steps forward before I take that horrible step back again and lose the tiny amount of progress I’ve made (landing interviews and not being immediately turned away)

Anyone out there who does cocaine, could you please comment on this to help me understand? I just recently found out my boyfriend had been doing cocaine for the last 7 months. Reason how I found out because he stole money from my account, it was $8000. He lied to his parents when I confronted with his family. He told his family that I had a drug deal with him. He is helping me to sell, so my money was his money. He lied!! The thing is I am still with him now. I want to ask as someone who never done anything my life. Please help me understand.

1. He said he lied because he was under cocaine influence and he had no memory or control of his action. Is this true?
2. He said he has only been doing cocaine for 7 month. He was having really bad nosebleed. Is it true that someone who had only been doing cocaine for 7 month could have a bad nosebleed?
3. He opened up to me that he wants help so his family is monitoring him 24/7. Is it normal for someone to be out of cocaine for three days to be super tired? He slept through days and night. Today is the third day clan tho. Last night, he seemed super happy and energized.  Normally he is super dead, did he go back to cocaine again? His nosebleed was better yesterday, but today it got a little worth. Am I just thinking things or he actual went back to it?

I want to help him. But I also want to know if he is really willing to change, if he didn’t touch cocaine last night, I’m willing to wait and see his recovery! Please help me to understand cocaine behaviour!!!

1. How forgiving is GHB? I read on some posts that ODing could be the difference of 1mL... is this true? Or is it more like ketamine where in actuality its hard to die.

2.  I plan to start small and gradually increase my dosage.. probably starting at 3mL and waiting an hour. Is this a good idea?

3. Does having a benzo tolerance influence it? I have a large benzo tolerance, but I obviously wouldn't be under the influence of anything (except kratom) while taking it.

She took coke a few days ago, After she just came out of hospital for having a bad reaction to acid. I know people say you can’t get addicted to weed but she’s buying an 8th everyday and she’s in debt to people. she struggles to remember things, she’s depressed and she’s looks ill. 

Everyone in my friend group has given up drugs but she’s still doing them. i’ve tried twice to talk to her about my concern but she laughs it off as a joke and honestly i’m so sick and tired of it. everyone in her life (bar a few people) are telling her she needs to stop but she carries on. 

i tried meth once i was already on mdma when it was offered so i took it. i regret taking it the comedown was brutal i thought i was going to die and i tell my friend this constantly and she still tells me she wants to try it.

I've been writing a newsletter about psychedelics &amp; psychedelia for about the last year. Recently have been looking to grow the audience a bit while staying in integrity. Thought it might be interesting to folks here!

Here's a link where you can read past issues &amp; subscribe: [https://tinyletter.com/psychedelic-update](https://tinyletter.com/psychedelic-update)

And here's an attempt at describing the motivation:

**1.** Reintegrating psychedelics into our culture is a big deal  
**1a.** Psychedelics can help us surface shadowed material, help us work with trauma &amp; old patterns that are no longer serving us, help us become more trustworthy / cooperative / compassionate / less zero-sum  
**1b.** Flow-through effects from doing this right could be huge; there's massive upside here

**2.** We don't really know how to do this reintegration, very much figuring it out as we go

**3.** I write to explore this, both trying to understanding the mechanisms of action better and to figure out which models are working as psychedelics come more &amp; more into the mainstream",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,692437,public,confidence,self,"""Psychedelic Update"" newsletter",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hnseo8/psychedelic_update_newsletter/,no_ads,0.0,1594280872.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I rate them from 1-10. 1 being “why the fuck did I do it, never again” and 10 “really good experience, pros outweigh cons”. 5 is the average, meaning its not a favorite but I do it when I’m in a mood for it. 

ALCOHOL: 
I drank a lot of alcohol in my life, I got drunk a handful of times, but I could never enjoy it as much as I wanted to. I get sleepy or depressed before I can enjoy being drunk. If I only drink beers than it’s alright, but overall, not a fan. 
4/10

NICOTINE:
I’ve been smoking cigarettes since I was 14. I know, bad for my lungs, developing brain, etc. With all honesty, I dont really care about it. I know this is gonna make a lot of people angry, but I love smoking. The only drawbacks for me are the cost and the smell.
7/10

CAFFEINE:
It’s not considered a “drug” and I get why. The effects for most people are not really that amazing, but it can help in a lot of scenarios. 
5/10

Now lets get into the “real” drugs:)

WEED: 
I was a daily smoker for 2 years and then I started not enjoying it as much, so now I’m only smoking weed only maybe once a week at max. I really like that you can use weed for a lot of things like doing things that require creativity or you can just relax and eat a whole box of cereal without milk. The drawbacks are for me: it can make me really lazy and mentally addicted.
7/10

MDMA:
I really love this substance, but sadly, I feel like it lost its magic for me. I miss the days when I did molly and felt that everything is beautiful and the love towards everyone. I abused it, and nowadays I dont enjoy it as much.
6.5/10

BENZOS:
    OXAZEPAM: Great sedation, muscle relaxation. 8/10
    DIAZEPAM: IMO same as oxazepam but more hypnotic. 8.5/10
    CLONAZEPAM: Not for me, not sedating or hypnotic enough for my taste, too long. 5/10
    ALPRAZOLAM: Too short for me, hits too hard, I rather do diazepam instead. 4/10

KETAMINE:
The special K, the horsy stuff, call it however you want, but this drug is one of my all time favorites. The things that I went through during a K-hole made me realize a lot of things. 
9/10

SPEED(amphetamine):
This substance is one of my favorites too, I might actually say, its my favorite. Its really good with friends, makes everyone talkative and social. My best nights consisted of playing board games or card games with friends, doing lines of speed every 10-15 minutes and talking and laughing. We always did this till the sun came up, we smoked a joint and went home to sleep. The only downside, wich isnt really a downside if you do this drug correctly, is that its really hard to sleep after doing it.
10/10

DXM: 
Oh boy do I love this drug. I really like a high 2nd to middle 3rd plateu dxm trip. The only thing that makes me do this drug only a couple of times a year is the vomiting and the somachaches from it, these side effects really ruin the trips for me.
6/10

LSD: 
I had a handful of trips. My highest dose was 465ug, I couldnt go any higher up. Sadly I never really experienced beautiful visuals, only for like 1-2 hours on the peak. Acid messes with my head and thinking instead of giving me halucinations, but honestly I dont mind it. I rather think about stuff, figure out myself, then just watch the visuals. Drawbacks are the length and the loss of the ability to sleep for 10-12 hours.
8/10

SHROOMS: 
I only had 2 shroom trips, from shrooms that we grew with my friends during quarantine. I really liked the body sensations, they feel really friendly and natural, unlike acid, wich for me felt a little forced and man-made. Color enhancement and slight visuals are really enjoyable too. Cons for me are mainly the stomachache and that I feel disgusted about myself when Im on shrooms. Idk why.
7/10

2C-B: 
I did 2C-B for the first time yesterday with my best friend. We each had a yellow batman pill. Around 25mg each. I hated the body load for the first 1-2 hours, the come-up hit me really hard. I constantly felt like I was going to shit myself. My muscles were tense and they still hurt even now. The visuals were really great, but the whole thing felt really unnatural. Not gonna do it again for a while.

I give no fucks when I go nuts

Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa, dead

Woke up from a coma

Poured up with a soda, smoked, went back to bed

Never thought I'd be such a loner

I tell my bitch that I fucking own her

My neighbor's daughter just got a dog

I'ma run it over, I'm a fucking soldier

So cold bro, fuck pneumonia

All my bitches got love for Sosa

I just wanna fuck Rosa Acosta

And disappear in Southern California

Strung out into the night. I'm chilling

Everybody worried that the lights might kill them

Uh, via sight slipping

Long lines of those white women

I'm with the homies, bump Counting Crows

Just went through a half ounce of coke

Blood pouring all out my nose

*Don't tell my mom I got a drug problem*

I'm fucking high-ly publicized

When the sun go down, I come alive

Cause the guns go off in the summer time

The guns go off in the summer time, blaow

Just anotha' muthafuckin' rap song

Broke and famous. Rich and crazy. Doesn't last long

Spent all my cash on a broken dream

Went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean

This will probably sound as weird for you, that it feels to me. But i gotta ask for some advice on this one.

First we need some background info;
My mom has suffered from servere migraines her whole life. She's been on countless different types of medicines for this, but nothing seems to work. The last six months she has'nt been able to work at all. A month ago she came over an article about a guy who did mushrooms, and his cluster headaches was reduced to almost non appereant.
So my mom who has always despised me using drugs, was suddenly open to doing it herself. When she started searching for alternatives, she wanted to try weed aswell. 
I've now been given the task of bringing her to Amsterdam to introduce her to the wonderful world of drugs. 
Tickets are bought, and we're going next week. 

I have'nt done mushrooms many times, so i was wondering if anyone has any doseage recommendations for her? 
I was thinking the best way for her to take it, would be as a cup of tea. Any recommendations for making it and for it to taste not so bad? 

And last of all. The trip-sitting my mom part. 
This scares the shit out of me... If anyone has experience doing this, please share. Tips are all welcome.

So, part of me doesn't want to make this post because of how dangerous meth can be, but I'll get back to that the end.

For the past few months, I have been taking 10mg meth (oral) 5 days a week, with a week or two break every couple months. I have just been volumetrically dosing DNM meth, which is significantly less than ideal.

I have found myself having the energy/motivation/focus to work on projects that I have always put off for later. After work, I used to be tired and tell myself I would start (whatever) another day, and just play games / watch videos until night time. The effects of 10mg are indeed noticeable, however mild and not actually very stimulating. I still find myself tired after work, just not nearly as tired.

From what I have read online, there are mixed opinions about low doses of meth. Many say that methamphetamine is worse than just about all the other options today in terms of achieving the desired outcome/effect. However there are a number of people who suggest that while meth is not the ideal drug in many scenarios, it is actually no worse than many similar drugs in some cases. 

Either way, that is not the point of this post. The reason for choosing meth is because it is ridiculously cheaper, 10mg a day costs me something around 50 cents a day. If in 10 years I am making enough money to afford better options, I will. 

I have seen many people start using meth because of the ""productivity"" they get. In all reality, the productivity people get from taking ""normal"" to high doses of meth is shit. You get what I would call a ""dirty focus"".

If you try to use low dose meth as a substitute for adderall/ritalin/vyvanse...etc type drugs, I have 3 things I really want to make clear.

1. Just because you not longer notice the effects anymore does not mean it is not working. Yes, when you build a tolerance some effects will be diminished. However part of what you think is a tolerance is just that you are used to the effects so it feels normal to you now. It still has an effect.

2. Do not take any more than ~20 mg a day. This is where most people go down a slippery slope. if you find 5mg isn't enough, try 10. 10 isn't enough? go for 15. **Stop there**. Whatever you do, don't increase your dose over time beyond around 20mg.

After staying clean and staying away from criminal activity for over 2 years ive decided to celebrate with a night home alone with some cigarettes and adderall..  
in theese two years ive managed to  
\-gain 55lbs mostly muscle  
\-laid the foundation of starting my clothing brand (postponed due to covid)  
\-hit 120k net worth at the age of 22  
\-found the girl of my dreams  
\- made 10k on investing in stocks

this is less of a bragging post and more of a ""if i can do it so can you"" post  
When I have all this going on in my life i have no desire or time to use drugs, therefore this week i finally had nothing to do so i thought id might celebrate.  
I Would consider myself on the few people who doesnt get addicted to things, I loved adderall but i stopped it dead in its tracks when i decided to change my life the voice in my head lingered for months telling me ""why the fuck are you working go do drugs instead) Ive never been a drinker, 6-7 times a year, and i quit smoking cigs once i quit my job in april..

I hope someone will read this and think, what the fuck am i doing my with my life and follow my footsteps, The older i get the more I realise that theese things are not just made to give temporary joy, but they are also made to stop us from progressing in life, everyone i see how ""just do it in the weekends"" are stuck. they go to the same shitty job every week, hate every day until friday, then they get high and drunk until sunday and repeat.. my friends.. this isnt a life. please open your eyes and change your lifes, even it if means doing something drastic. and if you use drugs as an escape because you are unhappy with your life, do something drastic and get away from it, save money, sell your stuff and start over somewhere else, dont live life like you get to live it twice...

Don’t ask me why as my friend is a perfect example of why this trend reckless. From what I can tell it is mostly popular with secondary school students 

He’s always so disoriented and out of it, I’ve shook him before but nothing wakes him up out of it, he denies using H but it’s very obvious to me. He’s tried to claim he’s just really stoned before but it’s defiantly an opiate high. His parents are not even that bothered so he has no one but me telling him to get sober, in fact people actually like that he dose it and find him funny when he’s fucked up. He can never get any school work done and has quit drug dealing (I know that’s probably good but is so out of character for him)

He never IVs it from what I can’t tell, no track marks but he’s very good at hiding it so I can’t be sure. I’ve even seen him do it in school before and it’s sad to see as he’s clearly developed a problem. 

At a party one time everyone believed he was on the verge of a K hole but I’m adamant he had just over done it with the H and was in a “nod”. It’s not my place to be able to send him to rehab nor would he want to go and I doubt there’s really anything I can do, I’m honestly thinking it’s too late.

Anything I can do whatsoever, even if it’s just a small thing ? Money isn’t a problem and I’ll make the time to go out of my way

Years ago a few of my friend that me its so cozy, so relaxing and it lasts quite long and told myelf “im not gonna die dumb, lets try it.”
That was one of my most regretful moments iml. 
I got home, sat at my laptop desk and swallowed 5 3,75 pills (~18,75mg) with little water. After aprox. 40 mins its effect kicked in and honestly it was interesting: i started breathing slowly, after a few mins a very nice euphoria kicked in and i felt like i was sitting on thin air. I could barely control my legs i was waking like i was drunk, but after a few hours sleep, it was time to go and play darts at a friend’s house. I took the whole pillbox with me, which contained around 15 half-pills. Gave 5pcs to one of my friends and he liked it, besides the “losing control of his movent” effect and when i saw how good and chill it got him, i’ve taken another 7 halfs (26mg) in one take and went outside to smoke a cigarette. THAT was my last thing i remembered. 
This morning as im entering the kitchen, i saw my parents looking at me like they wanting to strangle me, after asking them what’s the problem, they told me i was like a zombie and they needed to undress me last night because i couldnt move. I could barely explain myself out of it cause i never went home drunk or high.

So I was in line in the coffeeshop (to buy weed) when I messaged my plug and ordered 2cb. Normally he takes a while to respond and come to my place but he messaged me right back to say he'd be there in 10 minutes.

It's a 10 min walk from the coffeeshop to my house and I still had to withdraw money. Also my left leg was hurting like hell from exercising earlier today so walking back fast was really hard. Turns out, the atm near me was broken, my plug messaged me saying he was there and I was STRESSING OUT bc I was still trying to withdraw money.

He's a cool dude so when I told him I was still looking for an atm (5 minute walk away from where he was) he said he'd allow me transferring money from my bank this once. All cool! I had to run back to not let him wait, limping and out of breath, finally reached him and got my baggie (he's in a car parked behind my building).

Right after I turned around and walked around the corner, I hear a really loud crash and see a scooter slide along the road, the driver making 3 saltos while he fell. My plug just hit this dude while getting out of his parking spot.

I'm pretty sure none of them saw me and no, he didn't drive away, some guys were gathering around and the guy that was hit was already up and walking to the car.

   It was me, and four of my good friends who I’m going to call: M, R, T, and C. It was going to be R and mine’s first LSD trip. I had done acid before, but only half a 120ug tab, and the effects were mainly just a general sense of happiness and light-weightedness. 
We all dropped together in R’s shed (we were chilling at R’s house and the shed is where we usually go to drink, smoke weed, whatever.) So we dropped at about 7:00pm. I had the smallest dose at 225ug, 1 and a half 150ug tabs. All my friends took 2 and a third 150ug tabs. About 350ug. 

   We were relaxing in the shed on the comeup, had some chill music playing, and some trippy lights going in the dark. It was a good vibe and maybe 20 minutes in, we started laughing at random shit. Everything was so hilarious. My body was tensing and untensing in excited spasms. C pulled some nangs (nitrous oxide) out of his bag and we each took one. I cracked my nang and put the balloon to my mouth, and all sounds completely distorted. My vision went up to the trippy laser lights that I could see on the roof, until 6 of them filled my vision and all swapped place and colour. Then it zoomed back out and I came back into my body. The balloon fell away from my mouth and we all came out ecstatic that we just tripped. This was the first full on trip of the night, about half an hour after dropping. There was no way we could prepare for what we were about to see.

   We came up in the shed to the point where we were all yelling and laughing and jumping around, looking back on it it was complete insanity and at the time it literally felt like being inside of a cartoon. After doing this for a while, we all simultaneously ran out to the R’s car. We sat in the car just talking trying to form a conversation and explain what we were seeing. T kept saying, in a joking kind of way, “What is the end goal here.” M was stuck in some kind of loop concerning “The humankind.” He kept repeating and repeating “The humankind.” over and over again. And he also kept saying, “wait… wait… whoaa.” Every time he said this it would put us in a laughing fit, and he was saying it about every two seconds with “the humankind” spread throughout. Even though he was repeating the same shit, it didn’t get any less funny. He was also saying other things, for example, “ritalin”, “1080p” among others.

**Weird Vibes and Weed** 

   After romping around between the shed and the car, for god knows how long, we ended up back in the shed. The trippy lights were off and the normal fluorescent lights were on. It felt like the trip was over. I felt almost completely sober except for some visuals, like bright colours and warping etc. We were all pretty quiet and the vibe was off, not fun like it had been before but cold and depressing. We decided we would kick it in the shed for another hour or two before going inside the house. 
   
   M and R smoked some weed, and M’s mental state became even more strange. He kept going with his senseless “humankind” rants. T was being kind of weird, shooting strange glances around the room. I have no memory whatsoever of what C was doing, except for the fact that he was there with us and we were smoking his weed. It took us hours to get everything together to rip more cones. Finding the bong, the weed, the grinder and the lighter among the mess of the shed that we had made in our trip earlier, took hours. When we sorted it out, I smoked a cone as we were leaving to go inside. I stood up after the cone and I could literally see in 360 degrees all around me. It was like I had another set of eyes on the back of my head, but raised above my normal height. My vision resembled a TV screen that was repeating in all directions getting smaller and smaller as it spanned out. 

**The Door**

   We ended up in the house, and the next few hours was a blur until I had what felt like, the main, most impactful and meaningful experience of the night. This is going to be impossible to explain in the depth of what I actually saw, but let’s just say it was indescribably beautiful, detailed, intricate and also massive. I saw a small white crack in an empty space of blackness. The white crack opened into a doorway, shining white light out, which was almost blinding. This door was gargantuan, and there was a massive silhouette standing behind it. At this point I became kind of scared, the space around the giant man became vivid red. I tried to close my eyes to get away from the trip, but it felt like my eyes were being held open, or like I didn’t even have eyes to close. In a stroke of clarity I accepted the fact that what I was seeing was not going away, and I just had to ride with it and see where it would take me. The red became less of an evil red, and more of just a beautiful colour among some others that I was appearing. 

   I then had an auditory trip, the ticking of the clock in the room began to fill my entire reality, and become distorted. My mouth and throat was being separated into tiny cubes of meat and bone with each tick of the clock. I could feel where each cube was floating and when the clock ticked, I knew the exact vocal cords to pull and the precise shape to make with my mouth to imitate the noise of the clock. When the clock went tock, it had a vaguely sexual flair. My mouth and throat were all reconstructed after a small while. This may sound unpleasant, but I wasn’t scared. I was constantly amazed by the realism of what I was seeing and feeling, the amazement that a substance could actually change my reality to this extent was not something I could have prepared for, and it was beautiful. 

**The Game**

   At this stage we were all deep in our trips. I came to the delusional realization that we were all communicating through telepathy, or something, through our trips. It was a kind of game. Everyone that I was with was aware of it and in on it, and I was just piecing things together figuring out how it all worked. The events that occurred here were 90% entirely within my brain. (At least I think they were.) Everyone was running around making a specific strange noise with their mouths, not quite a word but a group of jumbled sounds, for example, “Fssshwooip”. I don’t remember exactly what that noise was but it was along those lines. My friends were all running around the hallways of the house, which I began to see from a top down perspective, and I was hyper-fixated on. Each time one of my friends made the noise with their mouth, it sent a bullet of energy, or something, through an arrow that was positioned in the layer of view that I had over the top-down perspective of the house. Shooting these bullets of energy was adding up points, and each time someone made the noise they got one point. I realized, everyone was having a competition to get the most points, and this game they were playing was linked to a phone app, or something similar that would allow them to view the amount of points they achieved throughout the trip, after the trip was over. I was amazed that a drug could link up all of our minds and allow us to communicate with just our thoughts. I realize now that this was just my perception of what I was seeing, and there was no real communication. Strangely, some weeks after we all dropped, we came to discuss each of our experiences in detail for the first time, C had a trip that was extremely similar to the scenes that I witnessed.

**Time Travel**

   After this, time became a massive blur. I blacked out, or failed to register what occurred in the following hours, but I ended up on a bed in R’s brother’s room. We were all chilling there, except for M who was standing outside half naked in the rain at 5 am, but that is something I will get to later. Basically, I sped through about 5 or 6 hours worth of time, with minimal memory of what occurred, and then went into ‘flashback trips’. These trips were recounting all social interaction following the cone that I smoked. My memory became more and more hazy as the night progressed, but these ‘flashback trips’ were playing back exactly what I saw. Imagine one of the moments from your childhood that you can only vaguely remember, maybe just a few sparse images or faces, and now imagine a TV appearing in your brain with which you could watch exactly how that memory played out that day beat for beat. On some subconscious level I remembered what went on that night, I was literally *remembering forwards in time.* I promise you I’m not making this up. This part of the trip may have been the most jarring, and exciting portion. I was amazed at how a drug, a tiny paper square could turn something so solid and grounded as time itself, into, well, a joke. Time is probably the singlemost factor that dictates the way, not just us, but every single thing in this universe inanimate or not, exists. And this drug just flipped it on its head, twisted it around and tied it in a knot like a clown making balloon-animals at the school fair. I thought deeply about this and found it profoundly hilarious. 

**M’s Loop**

   Now, back to M. As the night progressed his grip on reality deteriorated. When I emerged from my flashback trips, (In between each flashback I woke to reality, before going back under again to see the events which followed the ones that I had just seen.) So anyway, I emerged from one of these trips on the couch in R’s brother’s room. T was sitting to the right of my, R to the left. I greeted R and T as if I hadn’t seen them for hours. They told me that the events of the night had taken place over the past 9 hours. I was amazed by this. M had eaten a massive amount of cereal, and he had to shit, but also vomit. Because of this he became stuck in a loop, where he would make a move to go inside to the toilet, but then turn around to go throw up outside. He was stuck in between. In his words, “I’m gonna explode”. This was the latest of his phrases that he had taken a liking to enough to repeat every 2 seconds. Long story short M was standing outside for 5 hours, half naked in the rain, in the early hours of the morning at the height of New Zealand’s winter. He ended up shitting himself out there.

   We tried helping him, but we were all zooted out of our minds ourselves that our efforts were futile. R’s brother, the only sober person in the situation, was way out of his comfort zone and had no idea how to deal with it, his freaking out was part of what sent M into such a bad trip in the first place. M eventually came in, and explained what he was doing. “I didn’t want to be ratchet and put it in R’s toilet, so I put it outside instead. (As far as we could gather M was talking about a shit here). He then followed up with, “I have these pinholes in my lungs, they were leaking”. When he came back in we thought he would be mad we didn’t do more to help him, but he said, “You should have just left me alone for half an hour to sort myself out and I would have been all good.”
“M, you’ve been out there for 5 hours,” T said. M just blatantly denied that that much time had passed.

   He thought that there were 2 holes in his back reaching into his lungs, draining all the air out. During his “I’m gonna explode” state he was in an extremely contrived ‘self hug’ position, reaching behind his bare back as far as his arms could reach to cover the imaginary holes and stop the loss of air that was occurring due to the pinholes in his lungs. M had a horrific trip, and we have decided the reason why is because he smoked so much weed. I only had one cone and it caused me to see behind me, and get vastly more lost in my realities than I already was. M had 3 cones at least, if not more. M had the munchies and ate almost a whole box of cereal, which made him stomach-sick and snowballed him into a worse and worse trip. Also his refusal to accept what he was seeing played a part, I imagine. He was constantly saying, “wait… Whoaaa”, and “what’s happening to me”, etc.  Sadly this trip actually physically damaged M, as he was standing in a very bad position for an extended period of time, he gave himself nerve damage in his foot. Peroneal Palsy, which affects the ability to control movement of the foot. Whether or not this is permanent for him is still up in the air, but he has to wear a foot brace for the next few months.

**Reflection**

   Other than the M drama, this was an incredible night that opened my eyes to the world of psychedelics and the power that drugs can have over you, (Before this I had only done weed, MDMA and a microdose of LSD.) The next morning I was utterly drained, and I barely even thought about my experience until a few days later, when it became all I could think about. This is truly a magical drug, and while I’m in no rush to try it again, I am extremely excited for when I finally do, moreso I’m excited to explore this iceberg that I have only scratched the tip of.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,692384,public,confidence,self,"225ug + Cannabis, my First Time Tripping (Trip Report)",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hno70k/225ug_cannabis_my_first_time_tripping_trip_report/,no_ads,0.0,1594266892.0,,,,,Psychedelics,450b9864-9d47-11e5-bb1d-0ef44579b8c1,Psychedelics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Me and my housemate have been living together for almost a year and lately she's been acting differently than usual. But this isn't sober vs stimulant abuse different. We have both been abusing amphetamine since we moved in, so I can tell the difference between her on speed, her withdrawing from speed, and her sober (although the last one I'm not sure I've ever seen her after we moved in together).

For this entire year, I have been supplying her with the speed I ordered from the darknet but after I developed stimulant psychosis (for the 2nd time) and decided to quit for good, I had to cut her off and tell her to buy it herself. I tried to make it easier for her by making her a 'How to use the darknet' guide as well as setting up an account for her on LocalBitcoins, Empire, and also making her a TAILS USB stick.

Recently, she mentioned she was off the speed but is acting weirder than usual (she has Asperger's, but again, I've lived with her long enough to know her behaviour). The reason I think she's using coke is that the initial reason I even introduced her to speed was because she was using coke to study and I thought I'd save her some money. Now she just popped out, and she usually tells me where she's off to, whether it be to buy weed or see her boyfriend, but today she just said ""she has something important to sort"".

I'm pretty certain she's using coke, but can't be 100% sure. She's showing unusual anger &amp; frustration, napping (she could go 3 days without sleep during speed-studying binges, but now naps every day), avoiding eye contact, and other weird shit.

I've been through speed withdrawal several times and understand the symptoms, and this doesn't seem like it. I don't really care, and will ask her if I catch her in a good mood, but was just curious if there are any telltale signs that can distinguish cocaine and amphetamine abuse.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,692376,public,confidence,self,How to distinguish amphetamine vs cocaine abuse?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hnnpiy/how_to_distinguish_amphetamine_vs_cocaine_abuse/,no_ads,0.0,1594265409.0,,,,,Stimulants,,Cocaine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A year ago I had a pretty interesting expereince with weed. Didn't smoke much, but i got really high. I always knew, that i'm pretty sensitive for weed, but never thought, that i can have real trips from it. 

If I closed my eyes I could see patterns and shapes. The interesting part is that theese patterns came with feelings and ""memories"". 

There was a shape that always caused the same feeling every time i saw it. (I had the same experience a week ago and i felt the same.) I felt like, i have always known this shape, or i seen it sometime somewhere, and like i felt the same way many many years ago...  Maybe really old memory from my childhood... The feeling is similar to a normal deja vu, but still different. 

The shape wasnt always the same, but i felt like it, because the emotion what came along with it, was the same every time. (Naturally, i can't describe with words how the shape looked like)

Together we were perfect and thriving as couples do young, often taking hallucinagetics and smoking weed, but during one of our long breaks he resumed to binge psychedelics for years like it was nothing, every single day. One day, an experience on acid had changed his life - was convinced he was sent to hell and that he has to fully convert to Christian ways in order to attempt to save his soul. We are still together now, haven’t taken hallucinogenics for years now, but he has completely changed to that day, eliminating sex from our relationship (was a big part of us back in the day)... he wont touch me because he thinks he’s going to hell for it, obsessed with god and has psychosis. Getting therapy and treatments for this but still hasn’t changed his perception of sex. I’m only 22 and do not want this to carry on but conditions seem to be worsening.

Russian prisoners who survived the Gulag Archipelago, Jewish prisoners in German prison camps as depicted in Man’s Search for Meaning, African slaves, prisoners of war throughout history, all have been able to valiantly find meaning in the worst atrocities committed to human beings – all without medication, or vice, to alleviate their suffering. How can we justify crutches, moral vices, or medication for less traumatic, less suffering inducing stressors, when those before us have endured tenfold and been able to survive, find meaning, and live happy, despite their much greater suffering, misfortune, and injustice?

If none of these people were afforded an escape, or an alleviation, and they had to find meaning, find a way to psychologically remain strong and continue living, why do we, who find ourselves in much more fortunate circumstances, deserve the ability to escape? How can we justify the escape from the misfortune of life when the rest of the world suffers, and has suffered, to a much greater extent? Everyone goes through horrible mental states, not everyone has the same experiences, and obviously some people’s justifications and circumstances imply a more profound suffering than many, yet given the horrendous crimes against humanity which we’ve valiantly overcome, individually, and societally, how can many of us still not see the potential as proven by our forefathers of the human ability to overcome the most horrendous difficulties, and in so recognizing not be utterly convinced of our own inert potential to do the same in our own lives?

If those in the worst situations imaginable, such as those who underwent the atrocities of the twentieth century, were offered medication to alleviate their suffering they surely would have taken it. If they were offered an escape, a pleasure, a pastime, a way out of their situation, they surely wouldn’t hesitate in accepting it. Yet the possibility of such things doesn’t make it optimal. The virtue of forbearance and courage in not reducing the experience through artificial means implies a greater potential gain in the overcoming of challenges. The task of running one-hundred miles barefoot is more impressive than he who runs one-hundred miles in shoes. He who undergoes the pain of existence through the strength of his character and will develops a stronger character than he who alleviates his suffering. There is a line, discernible with wisdom, of the place in which we should take medicine, at the place in which we should shirk responsibility and discipline for the optimization of wellbeing, a point where continued endurance would not provide a character benefit, but rather be harmful. That line is separate for every individual, yet we must not, in anticipatory anxiety, relieve ourselves of self responsibility and independence too soon, we must push to that line, rather than alleviate ourselves of the burden through fear of failure while we still contain the potential of going farther and thus overcoming more. This takes wisdom, and it is a necessary caveat to the voluntary ""cross bearing"" and suffering inherent in facing the demons of existence. Temperance through fire, forging through pressure, character creation, virtue establishment, these are things which any individual, in effectively integrating his psyche, should wish to promote. It is in those challenges that present themselves to us, in those moments of mental weakness, anxiety, anger, and sadness, that we are tested the most, and to which, in relation to, we have the greatest potential for improvement. The only determining factor is how we deal with these moments, these period, how we choose to cope with existence itself in its ups and downs. That which we do in this world has an effect on our character, on the totality of our Being. The way we navigate life now, influences our further navigation of life. The more inclined and susceptible we are to vice in the moment, the more we indulge in it, the more likely we are to in the future. We must not set ourselves up for continued suffering, nor continued weakness, we must only act strongly, in that which is most virtuous, in order to increase in virtue, and increase the probability of responding to difficulty with strength and virtue in the future.

It’s just hard, and by hard I mean impossible, in practical life, to prove one course of action is better than another, given our lack of foresight of all the variables and the unquantifiable nature of wellbeing, especially in relation to long possible future time branches in different action causal chains. These things are easy to philosophically reason but hard to apply in convincing others of their actual implementing. While the pursuance of meaning and the voluntary undertaking of difficulty in the pursuit of what one values, in personal growth, is accepted by all on a theoretical level as being “good” and praiseworthy”, to see it implemented in the lives of people who haven’t experientially realized the actual benefit in carrying out such activities, the change in lifestyle towards one in this direction is almost impossible to instantiate from the outside. It merely is an individual choice, a path to be undertaken by the willing participant, who opts for it *himself*. While we can gain inspiration, and the thought may come from outside, the undertaking of voluntary change, the adoption of responsibility and the pursuit of what one considers consciously as meaningful, is something that must be pursued from the individual of his own volition. All we can do, as contemplatives, as philosophers or psychologists, is point out the *potentiality* of such a path existing, and offer logical and rational explanations to its benefit, then, the individual must do more than believe in said justifications, he must test them in his own life. If they are optimal, and provide the meaning which he seeks, he will inevitably fall under the sway of such meaning seeking and carrying out. If he doesn’t find the optimal experiential evidence, he will revert to nihilism, or a less optimal pathway through life.

Both of these conditions are often looked over in relation to psychedelics in today's world where decriminalization is a primary focus.

HPPD had a very strong impact on my day to day life, one morning after a 30mg 4-aco-dmt trip I woke up and it still felt like I had the headspace and some persistent visuals. From that day on I was slowly met with new symptoms, the most intense being tracers and visual snow for a long time. Honestly, to this day I can't see anything in the dark but static. Now there's no saying if that trip caused it or the many times tripping on various psychedelics (3-4+ a month) before that, but please be responsible and don't make the mistake of dosing multiple times within a period of two weeks or shorter.

Derealization(DP/DR) is often touched on when talking about HPPD. DP/DR was the worst thing I've went through in my life. The way I can describe it best, is it felt like I was living my life through a movie screen, like I was consciousness of what was happening around me but it never felt like I was really there, I was merely an observer of this life. I saw someone on this sub describe it as ""forgetting who you are"", and that really does happen, I felt as if I lost a lot of my personal identity in a sense. I was rather uncomfortable in my own skin for a bit after this.

Thankfully, the majority of HPPD and DP/DR symptoms only impacted me for a bit over 6 months, until I stopped smoking weed for a few weeks. Just know that both these conditions tend to subside over time with sobriety.

And don't get me wrong, I am 100% for the responsible use of psychedelics, but I keep seeing people, especially teenagers, who are going through this on a regular basis and it needs to be addressed.

Please, follow harm reduction principles and use these powerful teachers responsibly.

TL;DR: Psychedelics are powerful, and the lasting effects they can have is often overlooked. Be safe and understand the risk when using these substances.

Here are some resources that I think may come in handy:

Erowid - contains information about substances, has reccomend dose charts, and trip reports.

PsychedSubstance - a YouTube channel containing harm reduction resources for those delving into the world of psychedelics.

I wasn’t speeding so i had no idea wtf was going on.  as he walked up i resigned myself to one of two outcomes, jail or a ticket for idk what.

If not, go to therapy. Drugs won't solve your issues, could merely suppress them. Which is the real gateway for addiction imho.

Took 600mg NAC before bed too. 

Anyway, I just lay there sweating fucking balls, dick smaller than my thumb, cold as fuck toes and feet, and at 3:30am we decided to each take 1mg of etizolam (bear in mind I have a high tolerance to benzos, takes like 6-8mg etiz to feel it), and hour later another and an hour later one more. I knew it was a risky combination but I knew the speed's main effects had worn off and it was just the wakefullness and anxiety left over continuing to bug me. 

Now it's 12:28pm and I haven't had any fucking sleep (at one point I might've got 30min-1hr at the peak of the 3rd etiz being taken), and I feel like dogshit.

How do I get the most out of my snorting (mainly k and c). I struggle to allow it to go up my nose without it coming down to the back of my throat and then me swallowing it. 
C makes the back of my throat numb and I know I’m doing it wrong but can’t seem to get it through my nose very well. 
I was wondering what I could do for it to work better. I’ve tried looking it up but can’t find anything relevant.

Then I get a ride to the hospital and I talk about how great shrooms are with my other paramedic when I get there, the story ends with me being completely fine and getting a nice relaxing nice at the hospital.

I mostly got really fucked up on party drugs with friends (with a few LSD/2CB experiences) and generally was considered to be one of the best at handling themselves whilst high.

I had a weekend sesh on a Friday night a few months ago. I took 0.4g MDMA and then redosed with 0.1g more about 1 hour  in as I was coming up. I was really fucked and ended up destroying the bottom of the inside of my lip with my teeth chattering. There were a few more drugs mixed in over the next 24hours after that (xans, ghb, ket and even more MD the next night) 

After taking too many xans I was basically gone for a day. I then woke up and it was late Monday and I had been basically non responsive for that Sunday and monday morning. My friend was irritated with me for hanging around as everyone else had gone home, I guess he had ran out of patience with me being too fucked up (fair enough)

I actually felt quite refreshed (I had yet to learn about how hard Id gone that weekend) and got the train home. I went straight to bed when I was home. I wake up Tuesday and my mouth is exploding with agony as sores from tearing up my mouth hurt every tiny movement I make. Furthermore I feel quite delirious, but no more than is usual from an mdma comedown. 

Wednesday is when things got really bad, I was in and out of being awake and felt completely fucked psychologically. It was like my brain was silently screaming (I can't describe exactly what that means) and despite no pain at all, I felt something just killing me inside my head. My mother is really worried at this point and she knows I've been taking drugs, but I downplay how I feel.

Thursday and it's awful. I'm in and out of sleeping having endless sleep paralysis and unable to tell when I'm awake or in a dream sometimes. My emotions are everywhere and I'd do anything to feel better again.

The next few days are basically more of this, I'm randomly sobbing sometimes for no actual reason and I wanted to be taken care of so much, but had to downplay it to my mother.

It took me about 2 weeks of slowing getting better til I felt a bit normal again. I've got no idea why this reaction was so severe, but it was extremely traumatizing. All I could think about is how our one brain decides completely how we interpret the world, and it can be fooled so easily and you can be put into a literal hell. I now fear anything that could make me lose touch with reality 

I've since been terrified of taking drugs again, going so far as to reject my prescription ritalin. I still feel embarrassed about how I lost control and get insane anxiety whenever I hear about drug use. My body feels cold inside and I get that 'white' feeling inside my stomach with a touch of sickness.

 I've tried to get over it by reading people's LSD stories, but after reading them it's sent me back into a really bad way. I even find it hard to drink alcohol right now.

I decided too take 2 and wait to see if i where gone take the last one.
1 hour goes by and i cant feel anything so dumb me takes the last pill, now i didnt notice anything for a while.
45 minuttes later i notice bubbles comming out of my walls and dust bats flying around in my room. This wasnt the visuals  i where expecting, so i started watching videoes on youtube too pass the time.
Problably about an hour later i can see my friends in my room chatting with each other, couldnt hear what they where talking about so i just looked at them with my freaked out face (offcourse they where not real, but they where identical to my friend).
20 min later the visions started to get really intense, now there was things/creatures flying around in my room.
Short time after this i am pretty sure i passed out or i fell asleep not quite sure but what i saw now is the most insane moment in my history with drugs. So in this trip or dream it started with me flying behind some creature i could not recognice, but after 10 seconds i ser that it is a dragon flying in front of me. Didnt think much about it but how i saw things i thougt i was a drone, so this dragon was flying downwards now and i was following it. I can see an island in the distance so i flew over to this island and i could just see these small dragons sitting and protecting their eggs and shit. My head was pretty fucked at this moment and i didnt know what was going on. Suddenly everything gets black and i can hear som noises then i see this light blue endless hole in this black world i was standing in. I can hear something talking to me but i dont remember the first things the voice said. but i could now see one shadow of a human standing on the opposite side of this blue hole, that was where the voice was comming from. I dont remember what he was saying but i remember that i looked to my right and there was nothing there, then i looked to the left and 4 more of these shadow creatures was standing there. This really scared me but i had some sense that i was dead or dying so i asked the shadow across the hole from me. I asked him in norwegian «am i dead?» he answered «no» so i had no clue wtf i was doing here. And then poof some kind of portal opened on the other side of the hole and out of it came a human. He looked like an regular middel age guy. The shadow guy who was standing next to this human said «this one is dead» and then the guy jumped into the light blue hole and a few seconds after i woke up.
(I Learned later that you could get a epilyptic seizure from taking over a gram og pregablin, and after the trip i cant watch blinking lights our other blinking things) after i woke up i checked snapchat and i saw that i had sendt some snaps 28 minuttes ago then i realised i had sent these snaps right before i passed out, so i wqs in that trip for around 28 minutes. The clock was now 5:30 in the morning, so i was 5 hours in. Usually these drugs last around 13 hours for me so long time to go. Since the clock was 5:30 that meant that my stepmother went to work 30 minutes ago and my dad was leaving in 30 minutes. So for the last 30 minutes he was home i turned off all the lights and pretended to be asleep. 
This was peak btw!
40 Minutes later it was 10 minutes since my dad left and i am home alone, so i turn on some music and head for the shower, walking is pretty fucking hard on this substance but after 5 minutes of trying to get to the shower i finally reached my destination. When i open the door there is a ton of people in my tiny bathroom i try to talk to them and get them out but after a while i just had to take the shower mid shower everybody leaves the bathroom and i hurry up because i wanna interact with them. (i thought these people i hallucinated where my friend.) So when i get out of the bathroom i yell random names to see where they went but no ones responds so i walk around the house to find out what was going on. When i had searched the whole house i thought to myself that they didnt want to talk to me or hang out with me so they left while i was showering. This made me feel lonely and because of everything that was going on. I quikly became a little bit mental as i where thinking that i was the only human left. So for the last 6 hours i listened to loud music and got more and more mental by the minutes because i couldnt get in touch with other humans. (I was the only one awake the last person i talked to was 02:00 about 1 hour in so for the rest 12-13 hours of the trip i felt really disconnected from reality and lonely).

I ll come to smoke some later on the peak

We went in a neighborhood bar and I couldn't handle the music, it was dominating me, it was that kind of Slavic bar with,, manele'' if you know this type of music and it made my trip suck ass

I somehow managed to go home alone, pop all 3 Valiums then sleep 14 hours at once

There was also another girl there id never met and the girl who drove me there

I get to my friends place and I serve her friend 3gs and leave out 3 for myself. We both dose and just kinda wait and get to know everyone. The three sober people decide it's time to go get liqour and we all hop in the car.

Around this time the shrooms start hitting and by the time we get to the liqour store (30 mins away ) I'm tripping pretty good. Visuals are nice nothing to crazy tho. Everything was just very soft. Anyway we get the liquor (5th of apple crown for myself and the other dude  and a bottle of pink Whitney for the 3 girls) and we head home

Once we get back to the crib we start swimming and shoot some fireworks and just have a pretty good time. I'm drinking a lil (ik prolly not a good idea ) and everythings pretty chill. Prolly the 8th mortar we shot off tho ended up blowing up in my face /the other dude trippings face. And it really just kinda ruined the whole vibe. Visuals were still there the headspace was gone tho so I ended up doing around 125mg of molly.

While I was doing this the dude started getting really creepy with the girl who drove and by the time I got back one of the girls we were with was naked in the pool tryna get us to ""join them ""

Long story short i got my friend (who was very drunk) and dipped tf outa there. all in all a good night except the 45 min drive I had to get home (not proud of the driving part it had to be done tho )

A few hours later, and a few stupid insta dm sent, which made my day even more funnier, cause there was this girl sending me messeges and I didn't remember I sent nothing to her while I was also chatting with another girl, my friends picked me up and we went to this apartment next to the college he goes to, in another town. We proceeded to grab some weed but I ended up also getting some cocaine. More than I ever had picked up. They are coming in smaller packs now, but better quality. I was in the back seat of his car in the middle of the trip doing blow non stop the whole time. I went to his apartment and he lives with 2 very nerd engineer students who were worried when I accidentally told them about my coke usage. Even convinced me save the last bag.

The next day I woke up hangover and decided to do the dxm. I took 17 pills at once. Don't remember how many mg they were. 40 mins later and I was already feeling it. 3 hours later I was a robot melting in the sofa. Communication was not very easy at that point.

Not necessarily hate it, just get a negative sensation feeling from it. It could be related to my synesthesia, but whenever I feel like I'm going to be predictable in what I say or do next, I almost don't like it. I'll use the term ""nenergy"" because it's not dislike towards it, just a negative vibe I feel. When I explain something to someone and I feel like they can easily assume (whether it's a correct or incorrect assumption) what I'm deeply trying to say or have experienced, I almost don't like it. For example I don't like being grouped with a certain idea from how I express myself. Someone once said, ""The hardest thing to do? Describe yourself in 3 words."" Okay, well, um, ""Diabetic, philosophical, and experimental"" (I can't think of the synonym for experimental I want to use, but you get the idea.) Well when I say that I'm diabetic, people always assume ""wow that must suck, you must have a difficult time injecting needles and keeping your glucose safe all the time."" That's true. But the lack of knowledge that they have that I do for something like Diabetes is such a bother to me for some reason, I want people to understand it's like an OCD thing. I don't know if people experience this either, but with OCD if I don't like the pattern or something in something else....fuck...my entire words are falling apart. I'm sorry I'm trying to explain it all but it's not gonna make sense to anyone else. I'll keep trying. With OCD if something is different or if my sensory response is triggered differently in a certain way than something else, like if I hit a light switch with all fingers except my pinkie, my pinkie will have a mental but noticeable vibe to it. It'll almost feel like a physical difference than the finger that hit the switch. For me it also used to be colors, all fingers who hit the switch would be green (just example not real) and my pinkie would be blue, or red or something. The people that don't understand or assume or lack of knowledge have the same negative vibe as the lack of the sensory but mental trigger in my pinkie, or finger that didn't hit the switch.

I made this account for the sole purpose of asking questions here anonymously. I am planning on taking a combination of substances: 100mg Adderall, weed, LSD tab, and some alcohol (no more than one shot of liquor/ one bottle of beer). Is this a safe combination? I say some alcohol because I understand that may cause complications in the combination and many experienced/responsible drug users suggest caution when mixing alcohol with amphetamines (such as Adderall). I am a young adult between the ages of 25 - 35 years old, male, 6ft tall, and have an athletic build. Quite healthy by most standards: I actively work out. I have no history of chronic sickness or extraordinary health risks. I work as a creative director/artist in the entertainment industry and many of my peers speak of the creative neural pathways that have been permanently opened to them after taking LSD. They all tell me they have grown from the experience. My best friend, who is accomplished and well established in his field, gives much credit to the combination of substances I have named and even describes the experience as ""spiritual"". I also understand many great innovators of our time (e.g. Steve Jobs) have benefited from the experimentation of substances. I do smoke weed, take adderralls, and drink alcohol often but never have I taken LSD.

When taking these substances, I plan on being in my home with a safe guide (my best friend who I trust). I will take all necessary precautions and create a safe environment for myself.

Shrooms had previously been very recreational and all good vibes. Do you think if I trip tonight at a lower dose (1.5g) then the trip last week (the same dose I took before when it was fun) id be okay? I guess I want to trip if it’ll be fun and music will sound better and I’ll get euphoria and just vibe and chill out. I’d rather not if I’ll have an unpleasant ride for a couple hours and then feel weird right after. So what are your thoughts? And obviously I know everyone’s different and only I can say for sure.

Dear fellow users, I’ve hummed and hawed about posting this but I feel like it’s my best shot and getting help and understanding the damage I’ve done. Let’s start off with Weed, I’m currently 16 years old and only really started smoking weed mildly towards the end of last year, I had tried MDMA and loved it but understood in depth the damage it did as my mate fell into the loop of getting addicted ( so I rarely used - 15 years old ). This year currently 16 I have experimented with acid starting off with a half tab 175ug following trips full tabs, loving and fully understanding life as it came. The most recent trip has left me with the feelings of depression, memory loss, feeling retarded and basically forgetting who I am in general. As the day began I had planned to meet up with my mates and catch up with a few people as I hadn’t seen them for the last 7 weeks due to covid and being in isolation, we had planned to pick 5 tabs and only have a few of us at my place, we had a joint and a few cones before everyone starting showing up, my anxiety had started playing up as I hadn’t smoked for quite a few months, I guess this in were i should of realised to not follow through but my mind got the best of me and I’d had a hard day at work so I popped a tab. From here on in I can’t explain in depth, I recall having anxiety attacks and finding everything awkward and being a little bit frightened as a few people who I hadn’t known rocked up. The trip ended up lasting quite a while I recall starting the trip at 10pm Saturday and not getting to sleep properly up until Sunday 3am  ( 46 hours without sleep ) and then waking up at about 6am, I would like to believe I took 1, 1/2 tabs. Since the trip I don’t know what to think of life of even me as a person, I feel Dyslexic and feel like I have permanent memory damage. I woke up not being able to understand anything at all and have since had problems with communication, my consciousness has gone out the window and I feel in a vegetative state %75 of the time. I bounce in and out of reality and have no idea of how I’m still managing to carry on sometimes I feel suicidal and sometimes I feel completely fine and myself again, my vision feels fucked from time to time and I feel like I’m never going to be right again. I can’t put into words what I’m feeling I feel so lost and just have no clarity at all I just want this to stop. I know I’m just a teenager and most people can recover but I want a way out 

Please recommend me help or answer my question if another tab will do any help I know it sounds stupid but I’m stuck

I got this itch that I wanna confess about my experiences to my girlfriend of 3+years.

My drug use started when we were 1 year together. I tried weed and I told her the next day and it wasnt a big deal. She is 2.5 years younger than me and she havent done anything beside alcohol and tried weed with me once.


On the other hand I had a secret addictio  to weed which I quit and I told her later but she was unaware of my frequency of use. She only knew it when I told her like a year later. That year was a  really tough one for me and we werent the best to each other either.

I brought up that I wanna do psychedelics cos they might help me some shape or form cos I read about it. But the truth was none of use knew whats it like we never even knew a person who does them.

So she freaks out but basically she ""lets"" me do it. But I did acid and we had a fight over that and I also did shrooms and we had another huge fight.

We almost broke up that time and I legit had nobody besides her cos my life was failing apart mega super duper hard.

I quit weed but continue using acid in secrecy to heal and to just feel better in general cos I was alone and sad.

I quit weed and healed some trauma and started making friends again and tried resparking friendships.

I changed and matured for the better. Even she commented how strange that I was changing week by week. 

Its not hard if your life is in ruins. Its a lot easier to rebuild something.

So life is getting a lot better. But Im deep into some psychological addictions to not being sober. Cos life wasnt the best yet and a lot of things were missing.

Tried dxm and kratom.here and there and still in secret. Tried a lot more stuff like xanax, tramadol, salvia, mdma and the fuck do I know and it doesnt really matter.

She knows about the xans and the trams cos I kinda needed them. But doesnt know shit about the rest.

At this point I quit nicotine my 6year old addiction which was mega hard. (7months free rn).

And Im.fiending hard for whatever. I kinda just took a fuckton of supplements and caffeine instead to not lose my mind and not to get addicted to more serious drugs.

I also had a candyflip exerience where my whole relationship with her changed. And it changed for the best. It literally switched something in my head and I could truly see what was missing in our relationship.

And from that fucking night onward my attitude towards her changed 100%.
She even commented the first day how Im a lot nicer to her.

And this change stuck and I love her better than ever.

But she doesnt know about all the drugs and stuff. Even tho im no longer addicted to not being sober cos I got my shit together and my nicotine whithdrawal kinda stopped.

She is aware that my 2 trips she knows about changed me for the better. But truth to be told it was a lot more than 2 trips and it was a very painful journey to get here.

Through mental health issues and loneliness etc.

She would be okay if I were to smoke weed like on a weekly basis but I no longer want or seek the experience cos it doesnt benefit me any ways.

I kinda talked how I would like to trip on acid with her. Even if she just tripsat. (We actually tripped on LSA together and she loved it)

I want to share my joys and sorrows with the love of my life but im too pussy to confess. I dont know if she would be okay. I dont really want to stop but im not really seeking new drug experiences either just 2 which are impossible to obtain.

Our love is stronger than ever and we have been through some bumpy roads which almost took us apart.

I wanna risk it but I dont want to fuck all this up. I love drugs (mainly just psychedelics) but I also love her. I dont wanna be a soyboy and accept some ultimatum bs.


Its me the whole deal just the drugs use is the small letter on the bottom of the page which isnt really visible.


Any tips how to deliver?

When I had my first big panic attack a decade ago it felt like my heart was going to pop - despite the fact i was not even touching any sort of drugs at the time - and since then I have been always been a little bit paranoid about the old ticker.

Last week I tried 3MMC for the first time. I didn't mix it with anything and my dose was rather low (90mg starter + 30mg redose after one hour, oral). I had a good time and didn't get any side effects during the comedown. Slept fine too. The only thing that bothered me was some slight vasoconstriction in my chest that brought along a bit of tightness.

The next day i measured my vitals and found that my BP and heart rate were still pretty high. The chest tightness was also still somewhat noticeable. Being the anxious asshole that i am, this sent me into a thought spiral that i somehow fucked myself up and have heart and/or lung damage because i keep thinking im experiencing shortness of breath. Im breathing just fine when im distracted or out hiking, but im constantly getting these random thoughts where I'm wondering if im breathing correctly and then i start yawning and swallowing so i can get that satisfying belly full of air.

I have been keeping an eye on my vitals too and they seem fine. My BP is back to normal, my HR is at its normal levels, but i still find myself obsessing over my breathing.

So why the fuck am i panicking? What are the chances that doing a small dose of a cathinone ONCE has fucked me up physically? I have no actual history of heart or lung disease, not even in my family, and im not on any meds. I'm slightly overweight but not a lot.

Should I just try and get over this obsession or is there a legit possibility that I did something to myself that requires care? I have done a number of other substances and nothing has ever made me feel this anxious about my health. Not even on my worst 3FPM days, or the times i felt like my brain was broken by dissociatives.

First off, I just want to say that I love this subreddit and I've been browsing it non-stop for the past few weeks.

 Anyways, I have 2mg of xanax and was wondering how much you'd recommend that I take- I'm a first time user, so I didn't want to potentially over-do it. For context, I'm a 6'1"" 175lbs male. My main DOC is weed, but I've dabbled with adderall and LSD (don't know if it matters or is relevant). 

I'm not super familiar with xanax, but the one I have is a white bar with 4 lines, and it says G3722. What do you guys think? From what I saw, it seems like 1mg is a good place to start- but you guys are experienced so I wanted to get a second opinion. I'd want to feel the xanny pretty well, but not enough to the point where I'd blackout or do something stupid lol. 

Also dunno if I chose the right flair, I wasn't entirely sure.

Cold water extraction

How Extraction Works

The main idea is that APAP is hardly soluble in water. Most opioids however are very soluble in water.

APAP is soluble in methanol, ethanol, dimethyl-formamide, ethylene dichloride, acetone, ethyl acetate; slightly soluble in ether; very-slightly soluble in cold water, considerably more soluble in hot water. APAP is insoluble in petroleum ether, pentane, and benzene.
Preparing the extraction

The best temperature water to extract APAP or aspirin is roughly 10C/50F. Solubility is as follows:


Solubility
Type Solubility (31C/88F water) Solubility (21C/70F water)
Aspirin 1g/ 100ml 1g/300ml
APAP 1g/ 70ml 1g/ 159ml
Codeine 1g/2.3ml 1g/0.7ml

As you can see, you can dissolve 20 tablets of APAP or aspirin in 50ml of warm water, then cool it to 10C/50F, filter the solution, and end up with roughly the same amount of codeine as the tables contained but only a fraction of the original amount of APAP and aspirin. Opioids are also very soluble in cold water. Extraction works because the the opioids will be dissolved into the cold water and leave the APAP, aspirin, or ibuprofen behind. Also, the aspirin will be able to be caught in your filter.

If you are using capsules, you will not need to crush your pills/tablets. Capsules are also easier to dissolve. If you don't have capsules, do crush your tablets/pills before performing the CWE.
Quick Step-By-Step CWE

This process is relatively quick aside from cooling the water. A CWE is as simple as crushing your tablets, dissolving them in water, and straining the mixture through a filter.

1. Crush the tablets into a fine powder. Minimize powder loss.

    Tip: Put your tablets in a Ziplock bag so you don't lose any!

2. Dissolve the powder into warm water. Get hot water from the tap (NOT too hot!), as boiling water may destroy the opioid. Put the water in a container/bowl with a wide surface area, which allows the mixture to cool faster. Add the powder you crushed to about 1/2 cup water.

    Tip: Its better to have too much water than not enough.

3. Let the mixture sit and cool to room temperature on the counter for about 10-20 minutes. Stir it every few minutes until it is completely dissolved.

    Tip: Don't rush this! Go watch tv or something if you have nothing else to do but watch the mixture dissolve!

4. Put the container/mixture into the freezer until cold. No need for a lid on the container. Leave it sit until it is extremely cold to the touch. Do not let it freeze or ice up! This process might take 20-25 minutes.

5. Filter your mixture. Use a pre wet coffee filter, cheesecloth, or even an aeropress. A handkerchief might work as well if you don't have any of those. Put the filter over the top of a cup and secure it with a rubber band or tape. SLOWLY pour the mixture into the filtered cup. Do not pour in too much water or touch the filter, as you may break it and have to redo the filtering.

6. When it appears like the filter is done dripping into the cup and there is nothing left to filter, you will then have a dense, marshmallow-like substance. You may choose to squeeze the contents of the old filters through a new filter to save any remaining moisture. Careful not to spill! You may also add more water to the marshmallow mash and re-filter it, but this step isn't necessary. As the APAP/ibuprofen/aspirin begins to clog the filter ..even if is carefully decanted you might speed things up by doing two speparate filtrations simultaneously.

7. Bottoms up! Drink your mixture and throw away the APAP/ibuprofen/aspirin; most should have been successfully removed. The remaining concoction might be really bitter, so try mixing it with something sweet.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,692202,public,confidence,self,Cold Water Extraction,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hn5z8f/cold_water_extraction/,no_ads,0.0,1594194252.0,,,,,,e3e60fc2-9638-11e8-b910-0e8093d70bd0,I :love: Drugs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Google the color chart if you already lost the one bestowed upon thee by dancesafe.

I personally suggest fasting 4-6 hours before rolling, but definitely eat a decent breakfast. Your body needs to get the energy from somewhere. One bottle of water per hour no more no less. 

If it’s a pill, ecstasy, Tesla, punisher, or whatever name it was sold to you under then start with half the pill. Just because it passes the test doesn’t mean it’s not packed enough to leave you bugging your knees by the toilet. Pills are sold online with up to 300+mg in them. Wait 45min - 90min before deciding on the other half, but don’t take that shit once your two hours from the first half. Anything taken after the two hour mark is a pointless redose that will not justify your head space the next week. 

If it’s crystal then first timers start with a dose that is 100mg-120mg. Don’t start higher than 120mg unless your weight qualifies you. Here’s some math: (weight in kg) + 50 = dose. More than likely 120mg will be enough. Weigh it yourself. Don’t trust any nigga selling you anything in a capsule. Don’t snort it. It’ll work, but not for long and honestly will push you towards impulse redosing. Swallow it in a capsule or in toilet paper. Any paper to be honest. Don’t chug water with it. If you redose do it within 90 minutes and don’t redose more than half your initial dose. 

Do not redose more than once and do not redose past the two hour mark. Anything after two hours will be useless and just add to the comedown.

Alright so it all started back in august 2019 back when I was working at chevron.  Me and a friend where just talking about the usual dumb shit we planned on doing but then we started talking about drugs and he mentioned benadryl and I asked him what was that and he told me benadryl was over the counter allergy medicine but if taken in high amounts you could get really high, shit once he said that I was instantly like “ alright dawg ima need me a few pills of that shit” and he walked to his car and brought back 2 benadryl pills and he told me that the best way to take them was to drink a redbull with them, so I went back to the cooler and grabbed a redbull and drank em. It was about 30 minutes in and we were sitting outside on the curb waiting for cars to stop buy for gas and one happened to pull up and my friend went to get it so I stood up getting ready for another car to pull up cause that’s what usually happened but Jesus fucking Christ when I went to stand up i kid you fucking not, my legs turned to noodles and instantly hit started stumbles all over the place but I managed to regain my balance and after that Everything started feeling really slow like if time was stopping but it went back to normal a few seconds afterwards, I decided to go back inside and wait for my shift to be over which was only 2 hours away, after that I was hooked. Fast forward to December and by this point I was taking 6 benadryl pills everyday for the past 2 months but for some odd reason I challenged myself to take 24 this time since the pack was 6$ and I was wanted to feel a even more intense high since the 6 didn’t do much anymore. So I decided to take them at night when everyone was asleep and this night I happened to spend the night at my house since it was close to my work and I worked the next morning, so the time comes to take and you know the usual redbull had to be taken as well, I drank the redbull and went to lay down on the floor i my cousins room and it was 1 am when it started to kick, I slowly started to hear music playing from outside the room and started to panic when it got closer, the best I could was cover my head with the blanket and after that the music stopped and everything seemed normal for about 30 minutes til I started hearing random people talking and laughing all around me but when I took the blanket off my head it was pitch black and shadows were constantly moving all around and all types of shadows, short, tall, skinny, fat but the one the scared me the most was the one that peaking through the door starring at me like if he knew who I was, after that I almost shit myself and decided to try to fall asleep but the voices got louder and louder and suddenly then turned it my cousins talking which freaked me out for a bit because I heard my cousins walk to into the room and start to talking with my other cousin(his brother) and they kept screaming at each other for some reason and it was 3 am by then so I decided to open my eyes and tell them to shut the fuck up but when I did that no one was there, everyone was asleep and i decided to go to the room over to check my cousin but he’s was dead asleep so I went to the bathroom to splash some water on my face and take a piss. I finished, washed my hands and dried them off and proceed to head back to my cousins room but as soon as open the bathroom door all I saw was a shadow that’s looked like lil kid running down the stairs at full speed like it was running away from something, I jumped back scared out of my fucking mind and ran back to my cousin room, I later down cover myself with mountain a of blankets and fell asleep.

I never really took benzos just for fun and I wanted to see what I can do with the etiz. So I tried 0.5mg and 1 mg and nothing crazy I was just chill and helped me fall asleep.

I had 6 tabs left and I was curious what would happen if I take 2. It was nothing out of the ordinary Im chill not as sedated as with Xanax(alprazolam). I pop 2 more and like some times pass and its still nothing serious.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I had the bright fucking idea to take 2 more. So 6 mg in total. Mind you I never blacked out. Even If I did it was only brief periods.

I took the last 2 and made myself a sandwich which I kinda hardly remember doing but I got bits and pieces of it I also found some snacks. Great.

I sit down on my chair and put on some youtube video and take a bite.

&amp;#x200B;

Next fucking frame I remember. I wake up in my bed like 8 hours later. Im like WHAT THE FUCK. I look around. Plate on the floor with a half eaten sandwich a couple feet away from it.

Im like holy fuck this is some spooky shit. I try to find out what the fuck I have done. Apperantely I watched like 3 hours of youtube at least cos my PC didnt shut down and It wasnt playing by itself.

&amp;#x200B;

Im not even sure If I fell asleep but it seems like I did cos I didnt do anything on my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a VERY weird experience and I was tired the next day thats why I kinda doubt I even slept I just layed on the bed without blankets and all that.

So first I want to give some background I (16m) decided that I wanted to try acid. At the time I smoked weed quite frequently (and had been since I was 15) and had previously tried ketamine, lean and nitrous oxide. I had never had a negative experience with a drug so this gave me quite a big head as I considerd myself to be invincible to having a bad time (this is important for later). I decided to ask my friend (lets call him A) who had done acid before If he could buy some for me if I gave him money. A said sure and that he would by his own tab and do acid with me. At the time I was under the impression that A had bought acid of the dealer before but it turns out that this was a new dealer and he had never tried his stuff before (this is also important for later). A got the acid from the guy and dropped the tab off at my house and we planned to take it the next day with 2 of my sober friends who would be acting as trip sitters.

Now for the trip report.

A and one of my friends who would be trip sitting (lets call him T) came over to my house at around 1pm we also took the tabs around this time. I remember the tab having a weird taste and apparently LSD dosent have a taste which is one of the reasons why I think I was laced.

30 minutes since dose- I start to come up I remember laughing over nothing and having a really nice body high. 

1 hour since dose- My grandma (who would be looking after my younger siblings for the night as my parents were going out) came into my room to check how my window locked, I remember I couldnt really hold a conversation with her and I was paranoid that she knew I had taken acid. At this point I also kept leaving my room and walking downstairs and then I would go back upstairs and go into my room again, I got stuck in a loop where I felt like I was trapped in my house. I also looked at myself in the mirror which was weird.

1 hour 30 mins since dose- I decided that I wanted to leave my house but I couldnt get my socks on and got stuck in a loop where I would try to get my socks on and then forget what I was doing then I would laugh once I remembered what I was doing then the loop would repeat, I did this about 5 times before T helped me put my socks on. We then left my house and I remember being really confused and kept asking why we left my house we walked to KFC which was where we met my other trip sitter (lets call him R). We stayed at KFC for 20 minutes and I was confused the whole time asking what was going on and then remembering that I had taken LSD. we then decided to walk to the local park and on the way I kept asking where we were going like 20 times maybe.

2 hours since dose- We get to the park and lay down on the grass. This is my favourite bit of the trip as the sky appeared pink and the clouds were cube shaped. We rested on the grass for what felt like an hour mabye 

3 hours into the trip- this is where the trip starts to go south and I begin to lose track of time so bare with me. So unknown to me, my friend A had actually taken 2 tabs which turnt out to be way to much,  he started vomiting and briefly stripped naked. I was unaware that he took double my dose so this sent me into a bad trip as I thought I was going to vomit aswell thinking that we had taken the same dose. At this point I imagined that I was making jokes with people that wern't really there far off in the distance and one of my jokes was to throw my phone as far as I could, so at this point I also lost my phone.

4 hours in? - At this point I was very paranoid I kept thinking that everyone knew all my thoughts and that I was naked I also had an out of body experience as I remember leaving my body and looking back at myself lying on the grass.

5 hours in?- I remember feeling wet and I thought that I had vomited and that I was actually choking in my vomit and that I had died and gone to some form of hell. I also remember thinking that dogs were chasing me and that people were coming up to me and filming me. At this point I had enough and I attempted to run home. I remember seeing people in the grass and I kept on saying sorry for treading on them I was still convinced that I was naked at this point.

6 hours in?- I was walking home and all the people I walked past had really lumpy faces like they had been badly beaten up, my sober friend T caught up with me and bought me back, at this point A was in bad shape so R and T had to put most of their effort into looking after him which ment that they didnt notice for a bit when I ran away. Me and T caught up with A and R and we decided that we would go to subway.

7 hours in?- This bit is embarrassing but at some point I realised that I had pissed myself whilst walking, I was convinced at this point that the stuff around me wasnt real so I decided that I had to touch a car to see if it was real. In my point of view I put my hand lightly on the car but according to T and R I punched the window hard. Luckily nothing broke. I then decided to test out my theory if things were real by touching my friend R again im my view I lightly touched him but again apparently I punched him. At this point he was fed up (cant blame him). So he told  me to go home. 

8 hours in?- I get home and unlock the door. At this point it is around 9 o clock and unfortunately my grandmother is still awake. I open the door and she greets me and I remember that she looked like a demon and had long thick whiskers. I ran upstairs to my bedroom without acknowledging her. Bare in mind I have a very large and visable piss stain on my tracksuit. When I got into my room I stripped naked and got under my covers. At this point I thought that I was trapped in hell and that I needed to go downstairs to talk to my family to get out of hell. Luckily I decided against this and instead pretended to sleep for what felt like 2 hours untill I eventually fell asleep. 

I woke up the next day naked remembering barley anything and without my phone. I used my sisters phone to call R and he filled me in on the night, I also apologised for punching him and he was understanding which was nice of him. I told my dad what happend and he was very understanding as he had also taken LSD when he was younger. I felt weird for the next month but I have long since recovered from it now and it feels like a distant nightmare. 

WHAT I LEARNT- I learnt that I am not invincible and that I need to be more responsible, I also learnt that its not to bad being sober and I definitely reduced my drug use after the experience. I also had new views on reality and how it is all perception and how weird it is that a drug can change your perception so much.

Normal stuff, boarding the plane, etc, though, one very key difference (which will be very important later on) is that we were all wearing face masks and we all had a row to ourselves on each side of the plane.


Before getting on the plane I had an idea in my mind. I would play a specific song right as we were taking off ([this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mukQYm-O-AY) to be exact). I chose this song because I absolutely loved it and it would always bring a smile to my face whenever I played it on my phone.


So, as the plane was taking off, I played this song.


*Instantly I felt a rush.* A rush of **very** intense happiness and euphoria. I started singing along (quietly), and the lack of passengers next to me combined with the face mask covering my face allowed me to ease into this even more (which was absolutely essential in retrospect).


It was an immense rush of joy and euphoria. The music combined with the plane accelerating, then taking off, and watching everything get smaller in the distance and us flying higher and higher up was such an intense feeling that I can still remember it now. The smile on my face was *absolutely insane*. It was almost like a positive feedback loop. I felt really happy, that made me feel even more happy, and even more and more... up until I was sitting there looking out the window with an insane grin on my face that I've never had in my life before.


This intense feeling lasted for the duration of the song, and for the rest of the flight I had a really positive outlook of everything.


I have to say that I've never done anything in my life (except for a few beers and some caffeine pills during exam season). But now, after that experience, I am really curious and I really want to try to experience something new in my life. I've been doing *a lot* of reading regarding drugs for the past few months, and from anecdotes of other people, my experience was probably similar to that of a weak MDMA roll.

Haven't slept in three days, can't stand up for more than 5 minutes without needed to sit down, can't shit and can barely piss, shockingly only slightly elevated heart rate.

So my buddy just comes back from his home town into the city, and he usually comes every months so I ask him to cyph whenever he comes. We have cyphed and we always have good talks and adventures walking around smacked at night. However, this trip ended up being really awkward and just bad because of an unfortunate circumstance. Me and him are going to another smoke spot after hitting like 3, and this is our last one before we dip to our apartments. All of a sudden, this crackhead homeless dude coughs in front of us, like 5 feet away and we are not wearing our masks just because we were smoking. We quickly pull up our shirts to our noses, and he then goes up to the side of my face and says something about 4 dollars, he was right by a fruit stand so he might’ve been on meth and pretending to sell fruit or some shit. 

Once we pass the street we immediately wear our masks and then my buddy asks me if I have hand sanitizer. I am totally fucked because I forgot to bring my handy bag with me, which has hand sanitizer, wipes, and gum. I tell him if he wants to go to 7/11 since he wanted to drink something anyways and I’ll get the sanitizer. We do that and sanitize our hands and faces, then he tells me “Hey bro, I think we should call it a night.” I am pretty bummed because deep down I knew the guy coughing really fucked the vibe up but I agree with him and we both walk towards our apartments. We have a weird fist bump/dap and when I go home I text him asking if he’s alright and he says “Yah, wats up?” I told him “just checking if you got home and ur parents didn’t tell you anything.” He hasn’t responded since and I can tell he might be a bit pissed because his mom is a nurse and he travels a lot from my city to his hometown. 

I got tested next morning and I told the doctor my whole situation then he tells me. “Hey, I know at your age you do lots of wild things, just know that overthinking this won’t help you out.” “I can tell you are stressed out about this, but if it makes you feel better, the humidity of the outdoors makes contamination harder, aside from the fact you only encountered this guy for a few seconds.” He gave me a little nudge and told me “Enjoy yourself and stay safe.” I guess I’m just gonna sit and wait until my results come out. It’s gonna suck it I actually do test positive and I have to tell my buddy but at the same time, it might air things up if I test negative.

The king of dissociative’s

A cigarette had been dipped into PCP and yes it was PCP not an analogue

After 6 drags (that’s a lot) I immediately began to notice the visuals, it was very nice and trippy and I experience a warm feeling of contempt inside of me. A bald anorexic man appeared to be hiding behind a plant pot in the corner of the room in my peripheral vision but as I quickly look over he is gone.

Im enjoying the mellow and spaced out high which comes with PCP and I feel as if I’m in third person. Like a creepier ego death (when I think about PCP highs I often think they are creepy afterwards but at the time I enjoy them). It’s very dream like and incredibly tranquil. The visuals are in full swing now, intense tracers and audio hallucinations, the hum of a freezer turns into a deep voice whispering very quick. To quick to follow but explaining the science behind fear. It’s strange to listen too and puts me off a little

I stand up feeling like I’m in a simulation, like a video game with 2004 graphics, I walk into the kitchen where the lights are off and briefly see a family of people all sitting and staring at each other. I turn the lights on and there’s no one in the kitchen, I go to get a snack out the fridge and the fridges cold air hits me. This scares me and I suddenly get confused where I am for a second.

After this I go lay down and listen to music for the duration of the trip, music is weird and are as engaging as other psychs but in a different way

The day after I had no hang over, no comedown and almost an after glow. The only thing I dislike is everything still feels a little dissociative but after a day I snap out of that. I get to a very potent high but never over do it and get totally “dusted”, that level of high is where I imagine the psychosis comes in and that has more dissociation in the coming days. Some people I know like this though but personally it bothers me a little

I’ve never experienced the violent mindset people get into but I understand how a bad trip could trigger a violent response unlike LSD which more just results in fear as the headspace is what’s overwhelming (for me at least) where as PCP your environment feels very hostile. I believe it’s reputation is deserved and not deserved, with the violence being so shocking it’s hard for me to argue that it’s undeserved but for me the drug is unlike anything else, potent, trippy and incredibly peaceful

Also people spray PCP on cannabis this in my opinion is not a good idea as weed increases the intensity and paranoia of the high a lot and it’s best to smoke some bud separately if you want to. It would be like having to eat 40mg of THC every time you want to do acid. Just dip a cig in PCP if you have the option

Overall it’s one of my favourite drugs and is unfortunately written off for obvious reasons, it’s a solid 9/10 imo


This a very accurate visual replication in my experience

I took the bud out because i wasn’t gonna smoke some random blunt rolled by who knows who. The bud was gorgeous. It was bright green with dark purple spots, bright orange strands and it was pretty sticky. I honestly could’ve rolled two blunts of my own because whoever rolled it didn’t break it up that well, but i didn’t.

Let it be known that i’m not bragging; I’m not proud of what i’ve done. Karma will definitely catch up to me for taking what’s not mine. I’ve made my bed and i’ll have to lay in it, but if i could just get another blunt of this stuff then bring it the fuck on. With urgency.

I am a Huuuuge pot head, started smokin when I was 13 so basically smoked half of my life. The last year I couldn't smoke because i had trouble with my drivers license cause i was driving while on weed and cocain and were i live you have to go to an so called idiot test and give them Urin samples for a year to proof that you are not addicted.

The funny thing is that they test for everything except LSD and psilocybin. So as i couldn't take a lot of other things, only alcohol and i don't really like alcohol anymore, i took a shitload of Shrooms and LSD over the last year, like literally ever weekend. And I fucking loved it. Never tried it befor cause i had a lot of respect for psychedelics. 

But now comes the weird part. A few weeks ago i started smoking again and of course i combined my two favourite drugs. Weed and Lsd. Everything was funny and i had some really nice trips. 
But a few weeks ago i smoked to much while taking to much Acid and had a soft ego death. Already posted a detailed trip report here. Since then i didn't took any psychedelics. I only smoked weed and took some coke on the weekends. 

So last weekend we were partying with some weed, speed and Coke everything was fine. Till Tuesday. 
I smoked a huge bong hit after work which is pretty normal for me, befor a stopped smoking, i smoked bong in the morning before driving to work and basically stayed high all the time. 

Now back to that hit... the short version is it fucked me up... big time. 
At first i felt like i got an electric shock in the brain and after that i was laying in my bed. It started feeling like on my bad acid trip. Even got some weird visuals. Then my heart started to fucking  race like really fast not even after running 5 km it pumped like this and i had trouble breathing and then i started to shake over my whole body and i wouldn't stop for 2-3 hours. My Gf already tried calling an ambulance but they said we should get there on our own if i am not in life threatening condition. So i tried to relax and after 4-5 hours i could sleep and the next day i was fine even went to work.

The next day i smoked a little bowl. It didn't fucked me up but i just felt uncomfortable and weird. The next day i tried smoking a joint which was nice at first but one puff to much and i felt weird again. Then i tried smoking without tabaco (smoking Bong with tabaco is pretty common were i am from and i love the kick of it so don't tell me it's unhealthy I know it is) which worked pretty fine but i cant smoke much cause i will cough my fucking lung out when i smoke pure weed. I also tried dabbing which also works fine but same problem when i smoke pure bong i cant smoke enough to get really high without dying 😅

Now i am taking a weed break and that fucking sucks cause i was waiting a whole fucking year and didnt touch a god damn joint and i love smoking weed.

The first time was a year ago for an internship and i had stopped smoking weed for a whole month to make sure I'd pass. Fast forward a year and the job i gained from this internship got delayed because of covid so i had to find an in between job after graduating college. 
   I looked around my area and found a grocery store nearby and applied but didn't hear from them in a while. On the fourth of july me and a few friends threw a big party and at some point during the night me and 2 other friends split an adderall and snorted it.
   The next morning i woke up still kinda fucked up and i got a call asking if i could come in the next day for an interview. I pretty much forgot about the adderall but I was excited as i hadnt had a job in a few months and i was so tired of sitting at home all day. I nailed the interview then last second they told me I'd be taking a saliva test but that I could just start working and if i didnt pass it i would just be given cash. 
   So I have another test coming soon for my main job in September so i havent smoked weed in months but now all i can think about is getting a call from the testing place letting me know amphetamine is in my system. Ive never failed a test but I feel like the woman who hired me will be so disappointed as she was talking me up to the other people working at the store as being a good new hire.

Before working out I always find it somewhat “hard” to get into the rhythm of it. I find it hard to motivate myself into working out.

But then I began thinking about smoking a bit of weed before my workouts and after doing so, I saw a big difference in the way I view it.

After I smoke I feel a lot more motivated and ready for whatever I have to do. I find that my mind is more at ease with putting in the time required to make a difference for the better.

So yeah.. I’ve asked some people what they thought about it and a lot of em thought I was “crazy” cause of how weed can make you feel. Most people say it makes you lazy and unmotivated but honestly it just makes me feel a lot better about things and what I have to do. 

Is there anyone else who feels this way about smoking before a workout? What goes through your mind and if it does help, how does it help you?

This is about a time where I took 3 tabs of LSD and had a pretty challenging trip, (not a bad trip. I've had a complete nightmare trip after this took place and that's when I realised this was not a bad trip in the slightest.) And decided to try to stroke my sloppy flopper to take my mind off the trip, ended up having the best post nut clarity of my entire fucking life that possibly gave me the most memorable night of my life.

This happened about 2 or 3 years ago but I still remember it very well and decided to write about it. Before I get into the story I want to address that when this happened I was pretty experienced with psychedelics, just not high doses, highest dose ive done up to that point was 3.5 grams of mushrooms. 

I had a few tabs on me and I decided that I would take 3 tabs (roughly 300ug but felt waaaay higher than that) my highest dose yet. So It was about 9PM and I walked to the park with my sister and took the 3 tabs there. For some reason an hour and a half went by and I felt nothing so I ended up smoking a decently sized bowl of weed out of my pipe and that was not a good idea, no joke the second I inhaled it hit me so hard I seriously could not even figure out how to relight the bowl, i just kept on trying to get the flame over the bowl but I just was not capable of such advanced technology and hand coordination at the time. It was like my whole brain just dissapeared, it was just too overwhelming and i guess my brain didnt know what was going on and just decided to leave me behind making me feel confused and completely nothing going on behind my eyes. I realised ""home, home now not good"" so I just told my sister I want to go home for this one hell of a trip I knew I was going to have. While walking home i was looking at the side of this white elementary school building and it was the most beautifully detailed thing I've ever seen, it was like every colour at once just radiating and floating off with super detailed shapes melding into the building, way more 3D than real life, I just could not take my eyes off it. Typing this does not put it into its glory, theres just no way to describe it. Walking home i had the type of trip where reality starts to slip away and your not even really seeing where you are and what's around you. This is really hard to explain this next part. I could see the ground in front of where I was walking but when I looked into the distance it was like nothing I've seen before I was basically being engulfed into this other state of comprehension and all I could think of was ""holy shit I need to get home"". At times I even forgot my sister was walking right next to me, I remember once she wanted to stop at this tree we were about to walk up to in about 5 seconds so she could carve her name into it, not sure why she wanted to but I responded ""yes"" 5 seconds later when we got the the tree she stopped and I just kept walking like I didnt even know she was there, I just completely forgot about everything and was just on autopilot because I was so focused on getting home, she called me and was like ""where are you going"" and it was an ""oh shit did that really just happen"" moment. I dont remember the rest of the walk home so I'm going to skip to when I got inside. But also I want to add I was handling myself pretty well, it didnt seem like anything was really wrong with me and was still able to somewhat communicate with my sister on the walk home, it was mainly just me trying to tell her what I was experiencing but i just couldn't and i was giving very simple responses to what she was saying. I have very little recollection of that walk though.

When we got back home I told my sister I'm going to go into my room and I'll come to her if I need anything so she went upstairs. I walked to my room and the first thing I did was sit down and stare at my wall, the longer I stared and let the LSD consume me the more my room would completely dissolve and turn the reality I was seeing into something else. Ive heard of these types of experiences and to deal with it just ""let go, let it happen and ride the waves"" kind of thing. But it was the first time I actually felt like I was being pulled away from myself and I was constantly having to ""wake"" myself up out of that state, start thinking and moving around again sort of thing to distract myself from it because I just couldnt let go and let it happen. But one time it just sort of caught me off guard and happened on it's own and it scared me when I realised that just happened because it really felt like I was losing the ability to control it. when It happened it was so weird and unexplainable, all the space and atmosphere around me just completely turned into a black and white checkered atmosphere and there was a shadow above me moving, i felt like I was floating, completely somewhere else and all I could hear was just wind and the sound of a slow super loud white noise hum, getting slowly louder and quieter. I snapped out of it and to avoid that happening again I decided to put on some tv to distract myself. I turned on spongebob, I somehow figured out how to do it, definitely not without struggle. I was watching the theme song and what was on the tv was flowing off into the space around the tv, trails colors and at the end of the theme song there is a fish and it was floating off the tv too, it wasnt really a 2D show to me in that state. the only way I could describe the way the show looked was just ""disgusting"" it was way too detailed for a cartoon and I really wish I did not watch spongebob at the time, it was horrifying and hideous. It did not distract me ay all, I was still fighting that weird state where everything dissolves. and all while that was happening all my knowledge of ""LSD"" was gone, I knew I took a drug but I could not figure out if it was a dangerous drug or not, i was constantly thinking if I took too much and was going to die, because the thought of drugs was just so alien to me and as a kid i was always taught drugs are bad and kill people. I simply didnt understand them, and that was always popping into my head. I was getting thought loops that I couldn't get out of, it was all just one thought that would lead to another thought, that would lead to even more thoughts then loop back around to the origional thought and start the whole process over and over again. My body felt like a machine and when I closed my eyes it was almost as if I saw my own body working? Atleast that's the way I interpreted it. It was the most complex, detailed moving image of a human body made up of colors and lines, I cant begin to imagine it again in a sober state, nothing that could ever be painted or recreated on a computer.

Probably 30 minuets later or so that's when I made the decision to try and rub my pimple pod ""penis"" and see what would happen while nutting. I was searching for a video but porn on LSD is just really fucked, i couldn't watch an intense video because all those just seemed so full of hate and anger and made me uncomfortable which was weird, that stuff doesnt usually bug me, but on acid it was just watching 2 people ""hate fucking"" I found a more light hearted video off pornhub, it was about 30 minuets long so I started going at it. (I still watch that video to this day sometimes, brings back lots of memories). While trying to concentrate on the video and my task I kept forgetting what I was doing and would just find myself staring at absolutely nothing, my vision still dissolving and melting away and turning into other places, having thought loops and all the intense things that were happening earlier, my trip hasnt died off at all. I was still peaking. I was masturbating for the whole 30 minuets of the video and I still had very little pleasure out of it but I was so determined to get this to happen. So I ended up watching this one video for I'd assume maybe another 15 minuets, I have no idea, I had no sense of time then, until something was actually starting to happen and I knew that this was possible. I kept on having to avoid going into the ""acid realm"" that kept taking me over when I let my guard down. I was putting so much concentration on this goddamn video, everything I could possibly do to orgasm and not lose focus on what i was doing. I was vigorously going at it for like another 30 minuets, about an hour in total time, until it finally happened. I felt the rythm and if I kept this rythm and concentration up for another 10 seconds or so it would happen. And it did. I swear to god this was the most intense feeling I have ever had in my life, it felt like it lasted for so fucking long and while it was happening I could feel every single thing going on, it is completely indescribable how intense this feeling was. There was so much sensory pleasurable stimulations it was on the border of it being painful. I was tripping so hard at the time it happened I saw what I was feeling turning into detailed patterns onto the wall. I saw liquid fly onto the wall infront of me while i was looking at it and I thought it was real (which it wasnt) and got kind of scared because I thought my dick exploded because it really felt like it actually exploded (in a heavenly, euphoric, blissful, beautiful way), I looked down and seriously checked my penis to see if it was ok. I cleaned up my shit and sat down on my bed and everything was so clear, i wasnt having any more thought loops, there was no more reality dissolving away, no more trying to distract myself from feeling like I'm being ripped away from my body, no more ""tripping mindset"" I felt completely sober and happy but still tripping pretty hard with visuals and could comfortably enjoy the rest of my super light mindset trip with super strong visuals and the rest of that trip was fucking amazing.

Last Saturday i was rushed to hospital with acute cocaine toxicity. Before lockdown i had done cocaine 3 times, and since then i’ve been doing it every weekend. Very pure very expensive cocaine. 

I’ve been mixing it with almost every drug i’ve took including 2cb Acid ketamine etc. Mostly just for the sake of it to be honesty.

Last Saturday i did 250ug of acid and about 400mg of cocaine i’d say, and i didn’t drink for about 5 hours as i was stuck in a loop from the LSD. It’s completely my own fault and if not for the paramedics and my friends acting i wouldn’t be here any more. 

I’m addicted to coke, but i’m going to stop for a while and have a break, stick to my weed and shrooms.

Benadryl is a tryptamine

I've rolled about four times before, but want to make the most of this one. Going away for the weekend with two best mates. 

I've got ahold of some crystal, 1g, and tested it with a few reagants and it's come up good. Also have tested ket on hand and weed. 

I guess my main question is regarding whether to redose or not. Last two rolls I've bombed 80mg and 100mg respectively, neither times did I redose. 

I was treading quite carefully with those sessions because the time before I had a horrific experience when I didn't respect it and snorted god knows how much. Learnt a hard lesson that day (and the following weeks... urgh...).

Just wondering if it's worth doing, say, 100mg, followed by 50mg 30mins-1hr after peaking, or whether to do, say, 120mg in one go and then just enjoy some ket once we start coming down. 

Would redosing + ket be overkill? I don't really care how I feel the next day, although I'm not too keen on the initial comedown feeling when the euphoria wears off. I can take my mind off of it but I'm not a fan of that feeling! 

I've also loaded up with supps from the Rollsafe.org website. Vit C, Mg, ALA, ALCAR and Co-Q10. Got 5HTP for the day after too.

This is just gonna be homebound with some good chat and some tunes.

An hour ago I snorted 80mg of some really decent speed from an excellent ""source"" if you know what I mean with a high trust and vend. level and all and a lot of genuine seeming normally written feedback.

I'm relatively sure at this point that it is good shit because I can feel that somewhat background euphoria, the tingling all over from vasoconstriction (and obviously stim dick), locking jaw and need for chewing gum, enjoying music more and enjoying racing games more. Talking more too, obviously.

TMI as well but as with any stim it has also sped up my digestive tract I can tell you 😂

However, since it's been an hour ago, I've taken my heartrate and it's only at 68bpm which I think is actually a bit lower than normal for me.

Btw, this has happened before with 4-MMC. Snorted a 60mg line, no effect. Then did an 80 like 30 mins after and started definitely feeling good. But my bpm only go to a maximum of 92? Whilst I still felt all the effects and my friends' were all much higher. On top of this, my heartrate on cocaine is relatively normal too. 

Only bad experience was smoking a joint and then railing a line of 60mg to myself of a different vend. speed. Not as good quality either. But then my heartrate got to 118bpm for an hour and I obviously kinda had a really bad ""trip"". Reminder to always smoke after you snort and no problems will happen.

Recovering from DPH addiction; 9 months of daily 300-1500 mg doses total, Redosing throughout the day, With high tolerance at the worst points. Masturbating for 3-12 hours daily.

I have never done anything more stupid in my life. It's been 2 fucking months and the cognitive impairment is still there.

First the sexual dysfunction. My orgasms are -still- a lot more intense and longer than they used to be before my addiction, But what's the use when I don't even have any sex drive anymore? I have to force myself into it to even begin enjoying it.

Then there's the short term memory problems, Concentration problems, [Dyslexia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia), [Aphasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphasia), If I'm watching a video or a film I have to rewind every scene because my mind keeps drifting off and thinking about whatever, If I'm reading something I have to read every sentence two or three time to comprehend, That brain fog is horrible. Oddly I have no problems communicating with people irl, But this sucks.

And the fucking anhedonia. Good music sounds good but it's not rewarding, Same for sex, Food, Movies, Games, Friends, Everything. I miss being obsessed with a song and passionate about things that I perceive as meaningful, I'd do anything to have that back.

And worst of all, Ridiculously bad [cringe attacks](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cringe%20attack). I swear my mind would just randomly remember a literally ordinary situation or interaction, And I would cringe so hard I feel like I'm fucking psychotic, Which I'm really not, And cringe attacks are pretty common but now it's too fucking bad.

I have no idea if I'm getting better, If there's any improvement then it's so slow that I can't even notice it. The symptoms keep drastically improving and worsening for no apparent reason. I spend a lot of money on daily omega 3, Piracetam, Citicoline and several other ""nootropics"" and supplements and I don't even know if they're helping.

This shit is filling my mind with suicidal thoughts because honestly if I'm not back to normal in a year I might do it. I can't fucking live like this, I can't enjoy life at all, It's horrible.

Two reasons why I'm posting this: Kids, Don't fucking use DPH. I'm 21 and my brain is fucked, And once you're addicted to this shit you're a prisoner to it. Two, For the off chance that someone who has experienced that shit can tell me if it gets better. There's absolutely no info online at all.

It’s like they think we won’t see through their lies, it just renders their opinion irrelevant when they have to lie/exaggerate to make their point. 

And there’s countless genuine things they could use addiction, underage drug use hindering brain development, emptying your bank account, etc. But they would rather tell us one tab of LSD made someone assault all their friends, get naked and left them traumatised for the rest of their life. I had to endure half a dozen of these “cautionary tales”. Also they said heroin is a stimulant and described its effects all wrong, it was questionably inaccurate information

When they got to the dark net though, that was the best part. Ordering even small package of weed, that’s importing drugs, possibly internet to supply, possession etc.  They tried to portray anyone who uses the dark net as a criminal mastermind who’s going to end up spending the rest of their life in prison. In reality they send you a letter, if they intercept it at all.

All of the information was so in accurate that no one took them seriously and just found the presentation funny. If they were just honest it would be a lot more effective. They do realise that it’s not 1964 anymore I can just disprove all their misinformation with a quick google search

Before that, I had been living with my SO for 2 years, the last 13 months, we were heavily addicted to opiates. Well, he had been using without my knowledge before we had even met. We snorted them. I had accidently overdosed once...actually, that was exactly 1 year ago today...wow. He saved my life by calling 911.

On the day of this insane event, we had scored from a new woman we had never met through our normal guy. We handed over the 500 dollars and we got our stuff. 

We went home and used and were in bed not too long after. At this point, we were using to feel normal and keep withdrawals at bay...an existence I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. We tried to quit many times but couldn't. What happened next while terrible, was possibly divine intervention. I have no memory of the next 48+ hours until waking up in the ICU.

I was told by my SO what happend next. We fell asleep and my SO wakes up to the bed shaking thinking it's the dog. When the dog jumps off the bed and the shaking continues, he looks over at me. I'm leaning over into the middle of the bed shaking...suddenly I vomit all over the bed. He gets up freaking out to turn on the light and as I very creepily slide off the bed. At this point, I'm struggling to breathe, or struggling to vomit. He said my eyes were just blank. I quickly sit down and quickly stand up, somehow I hit my head on a picture on the wall and suddenly stop...before blood starts gushing down my face and into my eyes...me acting as if I was totally unaware. At one point I was sitting on the ground again and spinning myself in circles with my hands over and over. At some point, I do calm down a little bit. But then I  shaking again...laying down on my back. 

On the phone with 911, he gives me a dose of narcan in the nose and I start gargling. He is then instructed to give me 30 quick chest compressions...my sudden reaction is to immediately flip over and begin violently throwing up again. 

Being much bigger than him, as he tried his best to save me, I was literally attacking him...kicking and punching him...I hear him cry out multiple times as it make contact with his stomach.

I listened to the 911 call afterwards and it was a horror show. I could hear myself making the most crazy noises as the vomit struggled to come out of my mouth many times...not to mention the sound of my SOs terrified voice as he tried to save my life while pleading for help to arrive as soon as possible. 

Aparently, my body was in such a frenzy...6 men could barely hold me down. I ended up having to be taken out of our apartment and downstairs wrapped up in a sheet.

I ended up being put on a ventilator for 2 days because I had aspirated on my vomit (into my lungs) I contracted pneumonia on one side. I also ended up somehow ripping the ventilator tube out of my body myself unknowingly.

I woke up Monday and by Wednesday I was out of the hospital with a paper saying I had a suspected overdose. On what...I don't know for sure. Ten days later, besides my memory, the only tell tale sign that something like this happened to me is the staples in my head, a chipped front tooth, and a sprained wrist ...probably from fighting the restraints I was put into. I had been covered in bruises on my arms and had scabs on my elbows.

I am posting this to try and get some input about what may have happened to me. A few ideas is that I was exposed to flakka or bath salts or one of those drugs that cause your body to go insane. But I wonder because my eyes weren't going back and forth in that terrifying way that I see in the vids on YouTube. I also wasn't really moving my limbs all crazily. It looked like I was seizing I was told.

My other idea is that I was put into precipitated withdrawals. I had been on fentanyl for a long time at that point and had taken some that day of course. 

I had experienced pwds once before after taking the tiniest amount of subutex over 24hours after my last dose of opiates. My SO, who took literally an entire pill did not experience the pwds. So maybe our last batch was cut with blue and I got most of it. I don't know. 

I just feel that I went through something so physically traumatic that I was not there to experience it. My SO did tell me that despite my dead eyes, he felt that I was in there somewhere far away experiencing it all. I also seemed to try and push the narcan away he said. 

So that it. It was a literally horror show. Does anybody have any idea wtf could have happened to me? Like I said, my hospital papers just said suspected overdose.

After this happened, I made some difficult decisions and left the state to get help for my addiction. Amazingly, since leaving that apartment, I haven't had a single craving. My SO is also getting help for his. Today we are apart but over 10 days sober. 

I apologize if this post is messy and not focused, but I did the best I could with the information I have.

Waiting for the come up, I try and ease my thoughts because this isn’t my normal high. After finding the love of the needle, every other come up takes an entire lifetime in comparison. 

‘Just wait’, I think, trying to calm myself. 

I can’t help it. I look at the clock. 

It’s been 4 minutes since the ingestion of the ten 20mg IR adderall I just picked up from the pharmacy. 

Fuck me dude. 

I was driving, so there was an obvious distraction I could slip into, but instead I fell deeply into the cycle of checking my awareness every other second, questioning if it hit yet. 

Am I happy again?

Is the nightmare over?

Instead of being patient, I take another seven, just in case the first ten wasn’t enough, telling myself, “I swear I won’t take all 90 today. There’s no way I could, right?”

Spoiler alert. I could. 

I used to convince myself I deeply hated my addiction. 

Now I understand I have to be getting *something* out of it to have given literally everything i have in the world for it. 

Lost almost every friendship, and all my family?

Check. 

Lost the greatest love I’d ever had?

Check.

Big one, but,

Became homeless because of it?

You bet you’re fucking ass. 

Adderall isn’t my main DOC, per say. Simply, stimulants are. The best of that being good ole methamphetamine. 

And boy howdy am I addicted to that shit. 

I ended up getting a hotel room driving home after my doctors visit because I started getting horny. I checked in at 11:37 a.m. and by 12:42 a.m. that night, I had taken the last twelve adderall of the 90 pills of my prescription, and wished I’d had more to take because I knew the twelve wouldn’t get me to where I wanted to be. 

It’s the same way with meth. The second I felt the rush from the needle, there hasn’t been any line I haven’t pushed to feel ultimate bliss. 

If I allow myself to remember who I once was, I start picturing running into poles while driving. 

I am as close to killing myself as  I am capable of being without going over the edge. Nothingness terrifies me though. It always has, and it’s kept me from taking my life many times. 

But the idea of nothingness over this reality I live in everyday is becoming more and more appeasing. 

I am not who I once was. 

I’m not sure if I can ever be what I was supposed to be. 

I don’t know if I even want a life without this bliss. 

It’s who I am. 

I’m terrified I must coexist with my demons. I’ve been fighting this battle for almost nine years now, and it’s only grown more terrifyingly huge and all consuming.  I’ve tried rehabs, groups, had everything I wanted in the world, and still I couldn’t forget the bliss. 

I am afraid the reality is,

Some people just never change.

I’ve been dating a girl for over a year now who is absolutely incredible and moved in with her recently (first time moving out of my parents house), I honestly couldn’t ask for anyone better and I’m super happy in my relationship. 

I smoke weed daily, I do drugs occasionally but not nearly as much as I used to. When I first got into ‘hard’ drugs I really went all in, I was getting high on a plethora of substances on a daily basis - whether it be ketamine, mdma, heroin, psychedelics, benzos - absolutely everything. Other than weed and ketamine (and mdma for a brief period) I never got addicted to a singular substance, I was addicted to being off my face. This poly-addiction went on for just over a year until I got with the girl i’m with now which is when my drug use declined quite a bit (by choice).

I have no interest in completely stopping my drug use, however for some reason, recently I find myself constantly thinking about when I can get high next or what new drugs I can try. 

The main issue with this for me is that I don’t want my girlfriend to think that i’m doing drugs again because I’m unhappy - which is definitely not the case. She isn’t into drugs at all except weed but she doesn’t mind me using sometimes. Also I don’t imagine she’d be too happy about me being off my face every week especially since we live together, which I think is completely understandable.

So why do I find myself craving drugs more when I’m at a secure place in life? 

and

How can I convince my girlfriend that my drug use is simply down to me enjoying the high experience and a chance to escape reality? - rather than being as an emotional crutch.

Was I lucky? I didn’t encounter any bad trip effects. I made sure that my set and setting was sufficiently safe (I tripped on my own).

I am a Graphic Designer and Web Developer by day (I know not another one! We're fucking everywhere at the moment), so was hoping for some creative acceleration, improved focus and general increased positivity. I am also a new father, an 18 month old and a two week old in the house so was hoping it would in some way enhance my time with them. 

Currently I've been doing 0.3 of dried Golden Teacher powder every morning for the past seven days, this morning is my first day off purely for the reason i don't want to build a tolerance, although i am feeling more of a residual effect i think, the perception of a peripheral feeling is evident longer everyday which seems to counteract my thoughts off tolerance but surely it must happen, and i would inevitably end up having to take more and more to get the same feeling. 

The first day I only did a point two as I had no benchmark I had a slight nausea, as you would expect from having shrooms for the first time in a long time (probably 6 years since my last liberty cap trip) I felt like things had been switched up a notch on whatever scale my vision and hearing were plugged in to. A slight noticeable feeling something was at work but not enough to really put my finger on.

The second day was much more noticeable, I went up to point three, the increase was not in feeling but in my actions. I have a huge mirror in my kitchen and when I came down from my home office to get some food I spent half an hour dancing on the mirror and laughing before enjoying my lunch more than usual. The rest of the day was spent happy and went well. 

Day three I didn't work and doesn't the day with my family at the park in the sunshine. I was so tempted to double up to enjoy the beautiful surroundings but fought the urge and had an amazing day regardless. The grass was a deep green, the sky a vivid blue. At this point I'm not sure if I'm looking too much for something, or placing value on things that's i enjoyed before but in such a slight way that I'm now putting that on the shrooms. Who knows! 

Day four, five and six were great, productivity up, happiness levels are definitely increased, just a general wellbeing i didn't have there before, even though i was not unhappy before i was sometimes too bogged down in work, or too tired when I finished, letting the little things get me down, all of those things had changed. I enjoyed work more, i wasn't tired when I finished and spent more chilled interactive family time, things weren't becoming problems, just questions that had an answer, that had a clearly visible solution. The one negative side I would say is that my short term memory is being affected, it is terrible to start with but it seems that is being accentuated slightly but in the even Shorter term, so I'm making a lot more notes than usual at my desk. The feelings of the shrooms also seem to be lasting later in to the day even with the same initial dose. Is this the residual effect? Would it go on and on? 

Day seven, I'm now finding that when I play with my 18month old, it's almost as if I'm playing at her level, not with her as an adult. My childish level of fun has come from somewhere and I love it! Interactions with her are at an all time high in the way I feel throughout and afterwards, more rewarding, more meaningful (not that it wasn't before in any way) just more fun! I watched a 4k Disney film and was fixated by it, singing along, amazed by the quality of the water in it. Everything around me has more meaning and more depth to it. I want and need to find out more about everyone and everything, making sure it's all in the place it needs to be. I can't really put it in to words just yet but it definitely feels like things are going on the right direction! I'm almost sad I'm not doing them again today but I know it's for the greater good i have a day off. 

I'd love hear any feedback, comments, suggestions or even just a hello! 

If anyone would be interested in an update in another week then just say and I'd be happy to oblige :)

Where does the misplaced elitism in drug use come from? Why is it ""cool"" to use drugs?

 I've noticed addicts have their own little sub-culture of drug users that they consider to be ""cool"" or ""trustworthy"". But they rip each other off, assault each other and sometimes rape and kill each other faster than they'll lie about it afterwards. If I could only use one overarching word to describe the drug/addict culture it would be disingenuity. 

Now if you want to call addiction a disease fine, but I don't see anyone celebrating they've got AIDS and this ""disease"" usually results in running out on their kids, stealing from friends and spending a good chunk of their lives in some sort of adult day care (drug treatment, jail ect.)  all while holding this attitude of ""I'm better/cooler than you.""

Out of my around 20 trips on dxm 2 have been shit and the rest have been pure bliss, an overall wonderful time. 

Tldr at the bottom

So one night i took 300 mg of dxm, nothing out of the ordinary for me, an average dose. The first few hours went by, had the time of my life and then i started coming down, but i was feeling too good not to continue so i took 300 more  mg. That was a big fucking mistake, ive taken 600 mg and that was dandy so this shouldnt have been a problem. 

So i take the second dose and hop on valorant with my friend. And as i was playing my head was starting to get slower, i would just slowly move my mouse while standing in one place as the high was feeling more and more intense. It got to a point where i couldnt do anything on valorant so i just left the game. 

At this point i was a fucking zombie, barely thinking taking slow tiny steps and slowly making my way to my bed. When i got there i laid down and listen to music to try to chill which worked for a bit until i felt the need to sit down on my toilet so i stumbled my way over to my toilet and sat down. This is where shit really hit the fan. 

As i was sitting down i started getting massive deja vu, the worst in my life. To the point where everything i did, heard, said, and even thought about is something i felt i did before. Every little movement, absolutely everything. So i called my friend (the same friend i was playing valorant with) which just made the deja vu worse, but i thought it would help me calm down. 

So we were talking and i thought i was in a loop, that i would feel how i was feeling at the time forever and that i died and this was hell. 

There were a few times that i said something or something happened and the deja vu wasnt there and then i got happy as shit that i was 'free from the loop' then minutes later i was back in it. 

This whole thing felt like at least half a day at the time when it was really only about an hour and a half. 

So once my friend thought i was fine and to be fair i thought i was fine too, he hung up. 

Once he hung up the deja vu ended completely and something new started. 

I no longer thought i was in hell, but i was experiencing what id call mild delirium along with some other symptoms. I was extremely hot even though i was sitting in front of a fan, parts of my body would start violently shaking out of nowhere for a few seconds, my emotions were numb (they were this whole time tbf) except for my fear of going to sleep because i thought id be put back in the loop and my longing for the trip to end, i also started seeing mild hallucinations of lights and random things blocking my vision. 

Once the symptoms i just mentioned were mostly gone i went to bed and fell asleep pretty quickly.

Tldr: took some dxm and redosed because i didnt want it to stop.

I ended up falling asleep for a couple of hours. Definitely not the social edge I was hoping for. Recently, I tried dropping the dosage to 2.5ml and again I just felt very tired and almost fell asleep, however this time I managed to keep myself awake by standing up and walking around.

Is this normal or am I still taking too much? I have read people on here saying it can have stimulant like qualities, not to mention Xyrem is prescribed to people with narcolepsy to keep them awake.

It makes me drowsy, relaxed, and while listening to music the drums are a bit more suprising/defined if that makes sense. I understand that diphenhydramine can have negative chronic effects due to it lowering levels of acetylcholine in the brain. I do not have experience with other deliriants, so I cant compare or contrast. I only really take the diphenhydramine at night, so I can just kinda vibe without having to worry about doing stuff. 

I have taken DPH with Nicotine, smoking a whole cigarette fairly fast. Quite dissociative while the nicotine is hitting, from what I remember. I have also mixed the DPH with THC, as well as kratom. If we set aside the potential neurotoxicity of DPH, it goes very well with Kratom. 50mg DPH and 4-4.5 grams of Red Maeng Da Kratom about a half hour later (130 lbs, Male) I find that the DPH both potentiates, and lessens the negative symptoms kratom may have such as an opiate-induced histamine reaction and nausea, to name a couple.

I think for what it is, diphenhydramine is an interesting drug with various uses. Diphenhydramine is said to be linked with dementia and other problems, although I speculate that these problems might only arise with excessive use, although I do not know for sure. I also don't have factual information of what would be considered excessive. These are just some of my thoughts and opinions on the drug. Perhaps I tend to enjoy it because of circumstances that are specific to my life, as well as it's avaliability. Everyone will have their own subjective opinion.

I researched the risks and still did all the things they tell you not to do because, y'know, why not? No scale, multiple days in a row. I have never felt this far removed from humanity in my entire life. Normal during the day, blasting off each night. The first night was underwhelming--I was scared about dosing too high. It felt like a disappointing version of ketamine. The second night was alright but later became overwhelming--I inadvisably hit my weed vape a bit too much and that sent me into a loop of believing I was dying. Not panicked, though, just... going away. A few hours later (read: 6am) I figured I had entered into psychosis on account of the constant hushed voices. Tried to figure out the best way to present this information to the people I live with, but after some tough consideration, I decided not to disclose any of my shenanigans to the outside world aside from a friend or two. Chewed up some seroquel and went to work the next day. The third night was nothing but clear-headed euphoria, very comfortable, and that lead into a beautiful productive day. That day was today, and today was a good day. I almost made a reddit post about it. Now, here I am. Night 4. No more after this, because I feel that I've seen all there is to see. I can't believe I used to think that this was essentially ketamine with extra steps.

Language dissolves so easily. It comes and goes in waves. I don't know how much of this will make sense later on, but the concept of communication is a bit funny right now for some reason. I keep forgetting what I want to say, but you must excuse me because I am still very, *very* high. Got some antipsychotics on deck that I'll probably be taking soon just to get some sleep. Last night was great. This whole experience has been great. I feel like a creature that has pulled back the veil of reality. I can only type with one eye open. Afraid to answer text messages for fear of not making any sense. I'd consider this a valid fear, though, based on how difficult it is to process any earlier communications. If all goes according to plan, I'll be falling asleep in around an hour. Tomorrow I'm going to be dazed and out of it and will definitely want to redose, but that shit just don't fly anymore. I won't. I don't know how I've been going through these nicotine pods so quick over the past few days. I don't care about whatever my body is doing right now. As I'm writing this, there's a song in my head that I can't place. It might be a Tragically Hip song now that I think about it. I don't like that band at all. Thoughts are coming together a little easier now. The song has faded to a simple chord progression. I did not write this post in a linear fashion. Always jumping from one place to another to add or delete something.

I almost want to stay this way forever. Eternally confused, realizing, thinking, deciding. But that's just not how this shit works. There will be a price to pay for whatever souvenirs I end up bringing back into my sober headspace. Do I care? I don't know yet. Am I ready yet to cram this elevated state of consciousness back into my pathetic, limited vessel? Hell no, but shit has to get done and souls who've ascended to a higher plane of existence still have to pay taxes.

Fourth of July. It’s supposed to be a happy day, for most. I woke up at 10 in the morning out of a dead sleep. I notice my partner isn’t laying next to me, so I look around, only to find him facedown at the end of the bed, a bit of vomit and sweat surrounding his head, out cold. 

My heart dropped to the floor the minute I saw him. I immediately turned his limp body over, and tried everything I could to wake him up. I screamed his name. I slapped his face. I poured water over him. I hit his chest. I shook his shoulders. Repeat. 

I check his pulse, it’s there, but it’s very faint. I let out a sigh of relief, but the thought that his pulse might permanently fade away at any moment is enough to make my blood run cold. 

One or two breaths every 30 seconds. His face is pale, lips starting to turn blue. 

He’s a heroin user who finally cleaned up his life, and has been sober for the last 4 or 5 months. Everything was going great for him - new job, got a sponsor, going to meetings, hanging out with his friends again. Life was looking up. He said he was finally done with dope. Everything was just starting to become good again. We were both so happy. I was so proud of him. 

Through my screaming and crying, I remember his sponsor had just sent him Narcan a week ago. I shakily grab one out of the drawer, and administer the Narcan. I rub his chest, shake his shoulders, still nothing. Breathing is getting worse, I can’t open his mouth and he’s making periodic gagging sounds in place of where his breathing should be. He won’t wake up. My entire world is crashing down around me. I can visibly see the life draining from his face. It’s getting worse. The Narcan isn’t doing anything. 

I rip open another, and administer a second dose of Narcan, praying to fucking god this one does the trick. How could this happen? He was FINE. We just went on a beautiful vacation together, talked about our futures together, talked about marriage, kids, the beautiful lives we would build together. How could this all come crashing down in a matter of minutes? How could he do this? He promised me I would never have to go through this. He promised me that I would never be the one to find his body, overdosing on the powdered poison. He promised. 

He takes a big breath in, and begins to wake up. By the grace of god or whoever the fuck controls this tormented world, he woke up. He’s alive. He’s going to be okay. He’s going into immediate withdraw, and he’s in pain, but he’s fucking alive and breathing.

I called his sponsor to tell him what happened, grabbed my things, and left. It was the most traumatic experience of my entire life. I don’t know how I’ll ever forgive him for making me think that I’ll never be able to touch him again. Feel his warm hugs. Laugh about all the crazy memories we’ve made together over the past 2 years. I don’t know how I’ll ever get over this.

Whoever needs to hear this, FUCK heroin. Use this as a sign to get your act together if you’re using. Your loved ones suffer so much because of your actions. Don’t make it possible for your friends and family to go through what I had to. 

And for anyone who has gone through what I did, and didn’t get so lucky, or for those that got the dreaded call one day, I began to understand your pain this Fourth of July. It’s immeasurable to experience the reality that the person you loved the most in this life has been ripped away from you.

I did some research online and everything that came up was about 2C-B. I know what 2C-B is about, how it affects folks, and the people doing this ""tusi"" shit were not really of the psychedelically inclined crowd, so this got me confused.

I asked a friend that's way more plugged into shit than I am about it, and he told me it's a mixture of MDMA, MDA, and ketamine, with a pink colorant that brands it as what it is. Sounds like a hit combo in the right proportions, if you ask me.

I'm posting this to see if anyone can weigh in on this subject. I'm just curious, and fascinated...what do y'all think? Ever hear of this stuff? Anyone ever try it? What's the dealio, yo?

Ate just under 4 grams dried and headed to The Hobbit 2 in a giant cinema. At arrival I was already starting to struggle with shit like money and directions, and by the time I was sitting down and the ads were playing I was blasting off to crazier plateaus like with every passing minute. The smells and sounds of a hundred ppl eating snacks and just like sitting grosses me out...feel like I can strongly smell urine. Mild waves of claustrophobia.

Roll movie. 3D glasses on. Oh god, those fucking dwarves were unbearable to look at. The whole movie is just a relentless loud carpet bombing of the senses, and I somehow despise these dwarf imbeciles. Who the fuck do they think they are? As the band of dwarves reach Mirkwood, I reach a level where I become less aware of the separation of screen and reality, and I start to recognize people I love in the faces of the characters in the film. The elf lady is like somehow my mom AND my gf AND eva longoria. Primordial hieroglyphic OEVs everywhere. I get so emotionally involved at this point, I can't even imagine what my face looked like. I remember like grinding my clammy hands together desperately. The gasps and laughter from the audience sounds to me like chimps.

I suddenly realize I've gotta take a piss like 911 emergency. Here, the real nightmare starts. I apparently mumble something weird about watching my stuff to my stone sober friend (what stuff?), and make my awkward way past peoples feet to get to the exit. Their eyes burn in my soul. After a short battle with the door mechanism, I finally manage to escape the comedy stage I felt I had entered. I start walking down the flights of stairs to the exit, but I am so high at this point that once I make it down the first flight and arrive in a new room that looks exactly like the one i hust left, I assume I have gotten stuck in a time spiral. God knows how long I spent just staring blankly, looping over and over. I do end up making my way out, but I had taken the fire escape and ended up in the street. The doors to the cinema are now closed, and I have to have a confused argument with a doorguard to let me back in. Pissing feels like escaping fucking azkaban, and now I'm ready for the dragon.

Somehow the trip was just so glorious after this great escape in the fire exit. I can hear Smaugs voice way before I make it back in to the cinema.

I started buying clonazepam on May 24th, and since then have gone through 30 x 2mg pills.

I started taking them because of the anxiety I was experiencing from moving city, and they definitely have helped me with getting somewhere to live, getting a job &amp; making friends. I usually break off approx 1/8th of a 2mg tablet, and take that twice a day. Of course there are discrepancies though, have taken full tablets at a time on multiple occasions. I have only taken them recreationally however once or twice, every other time has just to self-medicate my anxiety.

Now if I don’t take them, I wake up feeling extremely anxious - almost as though I am experiencing a panic attack. All I want to do now is stop taking these drugs, but I am sure that stopping is going to exacerbate the anxiety I felt. All I want to do is be sober. I am just so worried about what is to come. I think I have the will to stop taking them, but if it gets to the point where I can no longer work (hospitality) I don’t know what I will do. I need to work to live.

I’m not really sure what kind of advice I’m seeking here, but would be nice to hear if people have been/are in similar situations &amp; what people recommend.

So here we go:


1. Are people actually cutting coke with fentanyl? In my (inexperienced) mind it doesnt make sense, why not use a cheaper and safer cutting agent like baking powder? Is there actually a risk of buying cocaine laced with fentanyl or are people intentionally mixing them as a form of speedball? The reason why I was attracted to coke in the first place is that its harder to  OD on than heroin, but if people are mixing it with fentanyl, then that goes out the window. Can I test for traces of opioids in my cocaine? 

2. How much cocaine would I have to take in 1 night to overdose? I dont want to over exert myself. For reference I'm a 160lbs (72kg) male. 

3. What is the best ROA? I know there are tons of ways to ingest cocaine, from the classic snorting to the infamous boofing. Which one provides the strongest high? I've only tried snorting because I don't know how to IV and I don't have the paraphernalia to smoke it.  

4. How do I deal with anxiety/paranoia while high? Or is that something that comes with the territory?

5. Is ""Fishscale"" worth it? I know a guy who claims he can get me very potent cocaine called fishscale for $100/g? Is it worth it, or should I stick with my lower quality cheaper source? 

6. Is there a way to test for the quality of my cocaine? I don't want to get ripped off. 

7. How risky is the dark web? Seems kinda shady not actually seeing the product or the person, and just trusting that they're not going to take your money and never ship out the coke. 

8. What are the best drugs to mix with cocaine? Or is cocaine something you do by itself? And are there mixtures I should avoid? 

9. What are your fav things to do while high? 

10. Do you prefer to do coke alone or with friends? So far I've only done it alone and it seems pretty fun already but I understand it's a party drug.

Not my first time. But this time was not like ANY of the others. 

About 15 mins of normal shroom activity other than starting to feel really disconnected from the people I was with. I ended up in the kitchen with my boyfriend, and he was being very sweet to me but for some reason I just burst into tears and said I HAD to be alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

He followed me partway to our room,  but I kept insisting I had to be alone. It didn't even really feel like it was ME saying it, just like it was definitely coming out of my mouth. This is between heavy sobs, btw. Then, I crawled into a corner of wall and bed on the floor and huddled against the bed part. It finally felt like I had arrived to a place that was safe to be vunerable in. I felt like a dying animal or something. Anyway. I had my eyes shut as tightly as I could, and I was rocking back and forth with my knees against my chest. All I could see and think was ""broken chains"", and I saw the image of a pile of rusty chains breaking apart. They seemed to be nice, large chains at one point in time.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I was sobbing heavily and couldn't quite catch my breath. Somehow I ended up in a position where my head was kind of tangled in blanket and I was rocking back and forth very aggressively, almost to the point of completely hitting face first on the floor and completely hitting the back of my head on the floor. Insanely weird feeling. Don't know how I had the core strength. Anyway, I was kind of half sobbing-half wailing at this point, with little screeches in between. I felt like I was going through all of the trauma that I had ever forgotten, and remembered, all at once. Just any memory that was even vaguely traumatic to me. But I think it brought forward some that I had forgotten about, that I wasn't even aware had happened to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't directly SEE any of them, it was like they were all stacked in my brain and slightly transparent but not quite, but I could definitely feel all of them and it was so goddamn awful. At some point my brain didn't feel capable of dealing with that, so I started to just kind of witness all of it but not feel its connection to me. In fact, I didn't really feel like me at all. But I was able to zone out and feel nothing in those moments. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was like I kept going between - being me, reliving trauma I didn't know I had - being nothing, just staring blankly into nothing and feeling nothing. No sense of self. Could probably have been slapped and not have felt it.  They were both awful in their own way.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend came in at some point soon after that began, and asked me if I wanted help. I didn't respond so he came over and unwrapped my blanket head. (btw i love him). He sat with me as I kept going between panicking - telling him what was happening - the two cycles I described before. He sat with me through the rest of it. 

Since then, I haven't been able to do social interactions irl. Every time I leave the room I get really anxious and end up having panic attacks, or I'll just randomly have a panic attack for no reason. Today I managed a car ride to the grocery store, but I couldn't go in. I'm still proud I made it that far though. I had a panic attack when I got home. I don't really know what to do about it. I just hope it goes away or something. I just really felt like I needed to write this out and share it, it was really hard to go through.

This is just a little rant about the world we live in today. So I am a MMJ patient living in california. Im 19, and just getting a start in the working world. I’ve had a few sales jobs over the years, but lately i’ve been focusing on college and growing my cannabis. But everyone needs to eat so you get a job. Well i apply at a bunch of places, and i get a call back from walgreens which if you aren’t in a area that has them, its a drug/convenience store that we have in california, not sure where else it is. but anyways, I get a call back for a interview and i’m hyped. no more having to wade through the job search world to find a fit. so I go into the interview yesterday and crush it. felt great even was told i got the position. I get a call today from the head manager congratulating me and all of that. but then she tells me I need to take the drug test that is required before employment, which I understand. But when i mention that i’m a medical user, her tone changes completely. she then says “oh we follow federal law when it comes to drug testing and cannabis laws. unfortunately, I cannot offer you the position anymore. goodbye.” and hangs up the phone. now I use medical marijuana due to severe ibs, khrons, and ulcers. I was admitted to the hospital a year and a half ago due to septic shock from my stomach lining tearing. now i have to smoke to keep any food down and feel normal. so it just doesn’t seem right that us medical users are looked down upon for simply using a medication. I understand that its a company rule, but doesnt it seem fair for mmj users to be forced out of positions just because of a medication that they have to take. medical marijuana shouldn’t be a reason to treat others as lesser. Im going to be smoking for the rest of my life, and I really hope things change. again, this is just a opinion. not here to start arguments or anything, just sharing how i feel. in a state that has legalized the use of medical and recreational cannabis, we should have equal employment opportunities even if we partake.

Having only done one proper psychedelic, and being of the belief that a lot of them were quite similar, I hadn't realized this fact. But when I thought about it, I found out that LSD to me does have reoccurring themes. 

LSD juggles the themes of the cosmos, aliens (specifically me being an alien on a space rock), collective consciousness, solipsism, God-like beings, meditation, loneliness, time, infinity, patterns and cycles. I know those are a lot of themes, but they are all quite significant. I have taken them from the handful of times I have done LSD, and they were the ones most recurrent. I know the themes of ""collective consciousness"" and ""loneliness"" might seem contradictory, but they somehow fit together inside my mind.

a) Do I have a high tolerance?

b) Am I snorting/ smoking 'wrong'?

c) Am I feeling the high but it just isn't what I expect?

For some context, I have done coke and ket once each, and both time snorted quite a lot. I didn't feel much of an effect though unlike my friends. When I snorted md my pupils became dilated but I didn't feel it hit too strong either. My weed smoking experience has also been pretty disappointing although I have done it several times. I have taken md pills (1 pill of 280mg) once and I did feel a high and it was very good (but short lived) and I believe it's the first time that I really felt the high properly. I really want to know what's going on and why I am not feeling the high. I snort using a key or straw exactly like my friends.

I'll leave this vague--i'm a student who's become entirely disenchanted with my chosen subject in the midst of a big project and at the end of an academic phase. It would be a protracted (and unnecessary) discussion to explain exactly why, but observing the coronavirus carnage has made me jaded and cynical about my discipline. Deep self-exploration and confrontation of heretofore unconscious emotional hangups showed me the real reasons I started to study it years ago and how that turn constituted suppression of a childhood interest in other subjects, particularly chemistry. Etc., etc.

I am intractably ambitious and want to leave a mark on the world before I die and be remembered, and what inspires me now is psychedelic psychopharmacology, vis-a-vis my exposure to the Shulgins' pioneering work and my own transformational encounters. I know psychedelics will become at least partially legal soon if research continues unabated and churns out good results (which it has and will). The philosophy of snotty interference in people's personal lives and imputing immorality to inherently morally neutral actions (like altering one's state of consciousness, engaging in one's preferred sex acts, etc) which drives the WOD is falling rapidly out of favor culture-wide and I think I'll see the end (or at least significant erosion) of its influence on public policy in my lifetime. I want to ride the wave of cultural reaction to this COVID-Trump-Racist shitstorm--and there will be a cultural reaction just as there was a Roaring 20s after WWI and the flu pandemic, and just as postmodern art &amp; literature &amp; the counterculture were born in the 50s and 60s after WWII. There will soon be an above-ground place in the world for Shulgin-type R&amp;D of psychedelic compounds, just as there was in the first half of the 1960s.

In light of this I want to go back to school for organic synthesis to prepare myself for this kind of career and being a top person in the field. Yet I have a lot to finish before that can happen and don't see a need to wait until I can take the relevant courses, so I'm beginning to work my way through a couple O Chem textbooks on my own and I'm wondering, for anyone else who is in the process of teaching oneself chem or has already done it, what's the most *efficient* way to go about doing so?

TL;DR: most time-efficient, mental-resource-efficient way to learn organic chemistry applicable to psychedelic research and development (once it becomes legal) with the time I have left before I can go back to school for it?",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,692018,public,confidence,self,Chemistry Autodidacticism,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hmg9ad/chemistry_autodidacticism/,no_ads,0.0,1594097537.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Id sit there staring at the TV trying so hard to pay attention but no matter what my brain would wander. 

Then I tried weed. BOOM. problem solved. i was able to get sucked back into shows even better than before and being high just made it so much more interesting and enjoyable. Fast forward 4-5 years, fucking tolerance. 

Smoking A LOT before sitting down to watch a show or movie can kind of help, but no where near close to the level it helped before.  I get a few minutes into the show then my brain wanders again and I loose focus and can no longer follow what’s going on in the show.

My close cousin overdoses last week on meth and 3 Red Bull’s. We were very close when we were younger teens, although she was about 2.5 years older than me. She overdosed at the age of 20. I don’t know how to feel, or if it even feels real. I’m thinking about all of the years she could have lived. I’m so fucking broken, I don’t even know how to live. How do I deserve experiences when she doesn’t get to have them? Bad things have been happening to me since she passed, and I’m starting to tell myself that I deserved it. It’s so hard to convince myself that I deserve the best. Deep down I know it’s not my fault and that I should be given the absolute best, but I don’t know. I feel like I deserved it because of the following: 

A year or two ago, I realized that she was getting into dangerous situations and hanging out with very shady people. She started to bring her friends over, and her boyfriend asked my brother about his computer; then subtly said that he wanted to sell it(as in, steal it then sell it). That made me realize that there was something going on that could potentially damage my family, so I had to slowly distance myself from her. I’ve never been an avid user of anything, but I knew if she offered me some, I wouldn’t have been able to resist. And if she had started coercing me into ways of making her and her man money, I know I would be too scared to get myself out.

Me distancing myself from her was justified. I was putting up boundaries. I needed to put my immediate family first. But now that she’s gone, it feels like I did the wrong thing. I wanted to have been there for her more, even though I reached out to her often to make sure she was okay. Or at least as okay as she could’ve been.

I had a bunch of powder but no proper scales, I had a kitchen scale though that could measure in 1 gram increments so I thought fuck it, weighed out a gram on there and wrapped up 2 neat little balls of powder in cigarette paper. One was a little bigger so I decided to swallow that one and my ex took the other. About 10 minutes later I realised I had fucked up when I started feeling waves of nausea and dissociation. After about an hour I ended up where I usually do on a DXM comeup, in the shower. The nausea was absolutely soul crushing, and I for the first time on any drug, got the Fear. I simultaneously had the 3 thoughts you never ever want to have on psychedelics. 1. I am going to fucking die. 2. I am in so much physical pain I want to fucking die. 3. I am going to be like this forever. So I was laying on the floor of the shower, barely conscious and wishing for death as that horrible shit twisted through my guts. I eventually made it out of the shower and leveled out a little bit, and found my ex in the living room staring at the floor tiles. This was her first time and she was definitely in for some shit.

We eventually migrated to the bed room where all memory of the night becomes a fucking blur. A whole shit ton of tossing and turning in bed, and I distinctly remember insane, LSD like visuals where hundreds of dark and angry ethereal figures loomed over my in my bedroom, judging me for what I'd done to myself and my partner. The entire time I thought that she must have been shitting herself from the trip but it turns out she actually barely felt it and found it mildly enjoyable at best, probably due to the lower dose she took.

I however was completely fucked out of my mind. I decided to put on some music, settling on the album Scenes From A Memory by Dream Theater (A must listen if you haven't heard it) and I entered a bizarre state where the usual 4th plateau dissociation occured but it kept going from absolutely disgustingly unbearable in terms of body sensations to intensely euphoric. This was just fucked in so many ways I can't even begin to describe. The most interesting part was the fact that I could see everything in my room with my eyes closed for some reason.

At some point, I gave up on trying to listening to music and tried to just sleep it off. I slipped into a bizarre semi-lucid, conscious unconsciousness that anybody who has tried to sleep on DXM will be very familiar with. Nonsensical geometry surrounded me as I tumbled through the equivalent of a mental garbage heap until I finally passed out completely for a few hours. I woke up and was even more fucked than earlier. This was in theory, when the DXM had almost entirely metabolised into DXO and the real mindfuck begins. I no longer recognised anything in my room. The world around me was filled with visual snow that was rapidly forming into bizarre tiny robotic creatures that were ""constructing"" reality around me. I wish I could explain this part of the trip properly but no words really do that kind of thing justice. At some point after this I passed out again and woke up at around 7am or so. 
I tried to get out of bed and stand up and instantly fell back down on my ass. All sense of balance had still abandoned me and I could barely see. Back to sleep.

Another 4 or 5 hours later I woke up completely sober, if not a little out of it. This was probably 6 months ago and I'm just now remembering enough about the trip to actually write about it properly. Seriously, don't fuck around with this stuff. I've eaten shit tons of acid and locked myself in my room with my mum sleeping next door at the age of 15 and the shit I experienced doesn't even begin to compare to the absolute mind-rape that I experienced that night. After weighing the bag out of curiosity, It turns out that around 2.3 grams were missing. I'm guessing based on experience I had about 2000mg and the ex probably had a miniscule amount in comparison.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,691956,public,confidence,self,NEVER eyeball doses of DXM powder: Insane trip story from a while ago.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hmcno6/never_eyeball_doses_of_dxm_powder_insane_trip/,no_ads,0.0,1594087301.0,,,,,Custom,9469b226-728a-11e9-b0d5-0ebd9c4fbbf8,Long Post,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1594058718.0

However, ""cloud spirit"" is the closest thing I can describe what me(20F) and my boyfriend(22M) saw. We dropped around 7:30pm with 3.5 g's for me and 4 for him mixed in smoothies. 

Soon, we headed outside to my backyard. After playing ball with my dog and walking around a bit enjoying nature, we laid down on the patio and started looking at the sky. This one weird cloud was right in front of our vision. Both of us felt like it was weird and I kept saying I've never seen something like that. Occasionally I would see faces, he did too(I only mention because after looking online for cloud spirits, some people say they look like faces). As the trip went on, a tiny bit of fog rolled in behind us above the house - which is unusual because the conditions didn't seem right(June 2, Chicagoland area). We laid there for what felt like hours. The cloud also stayed there for a long time it seemed. The tendrils seemed to be coming closer, but I wasn't afraid, it seemed benevolent. Like it was watching over us, or enjoying the company of a stranger. 

Eventually it left, but the trees were still beautiful and wonderful. After looking at the trees and the sky, everything seemed a lot closer. From the cloud in the beginning, to the trees I know and love, to the stars that I don't get to see often enough, it was like they were being drawn to us as much as our attention was on them. 

While the nausea left me alone for the first two or so hours, it came back with avengence. I eventually felt like running might help, so we got ready and went for my usual 2 mile run, while he skateboarded alongside me. It's not like I lasted very long haha, it soon turned into a 2 mile walk in which we peaked. It seemed to take forever, but it was awesome. It was actually during this walk that I decided I wanted to be with this man for the rest of my life.

We got back, smoked some weed and then lit off some fireworks in a park close to my house. It was 2am, and by that time most of the visuals had worn off, but the gratitude and euphoria that we experienced were very much still there.

My question is if there are compounds that you're guaranteed to have a good time on. 

Psychedelics most definitely not, obviously.

MDMA does not always make you euphoric either. I have always made pauses of at least 3 months and sometimes the stuff works, sometimes it only makes u chew your teeth to powder with no or little euphoric effects

Codein/Tilidin have always made me feel better for sure, but not really euphoric in the sense of the word. Just warm and cozy, which does feel nice but is not to be compared to feeling happy. ( Hope you understand)

Alcohol can be quite euphoric, more so than Opioids are. (for me at least) but if you're feeling like shit and then drink, you're going to feel like shit and be drunk.

Amphetamine does work as a no-brainer happy chemical. (For a ranging amount of hours obviously, it's still drugs after all) 

N2O does cause Euphoria for a very short amount of time and also builds up tolerance reeaally fast.

Nicotine does not have strong euphoric effects.


Tell me what you think of my opinion to the effects of those substances and more importantly; tell me about your experiences with substances not listed above.

This is not about me wanting you to recommend me substances. I want to know if there are actually drugs like in the movies, that you drop and 100% are going to enjoy it.

However I’m feeling particularly angry about it today (Probably the coke).

Prohibition is the biggest fuck you to the people. It’s probably the issue that affects us more than any other bullshit the govt pulls yet it seems to just to be accepted as part of the status quo.

We have unfathomably wealthy and powerful cartels in counties where corruption is rife and puts them above the law, in fact puts them in control of the law itself because they control the fucking legislators too. Tens of thousands of drug related murders in these countries every year, essentially genocide happening right in front of our noses with token consequences and govt reaction.

On the other side of the equation in the consumer nations we have massively over inflated law enforcement budgets. Huge amounts of drug related deaths because there is no one to regulate the shit you snort/shoot/smoke. Overcrowded prisons and a prison industrial complex born off the back of it. Banking systems which are the back bone of the capitalist economy making huge profits hiding and reinvesting billions in laundered drug money.

Entire races subjugated and victimised due to the poverty they’re born into and the prolific drug activity that goes hand in hand with that.

It’s the biggest racket in history and this same argument is raised time and time again but nothing changes.

We know for certain that people are going to use drugs no matter what, legal or illegal. The harm reduction alone from regulating these drugs would take a huge burden from our health systems, people’s lives will be saved. 

The tax revenue may come close to the ridiculous law enforcement budgets used to fight the war on drugs in the first place. Prisons would actually be within capacity rather than the overcrowded hell holes they have become which create criminals rather than reform them.

Police would be able to solve real fucking crimes and the justice system would move faster and more efficiently when not clogged up and inundated with drug cases.

The cartels at the top level and all the violence we see in producer and smuggling nations in central and South America as well as central and south east Asia would have far less power, again, saving lives. Organised crime in he consumer nations would be crippled too.

All the violence and death and imprisonment. Families torn apart, peoples lives ruined forever for a stain on their record for possessing some powder they used to sell in pharmacies without a prescription.

I don’t understand it. It makes me so angry. I understand society now functions around this prohibition system and systems are resistant to change. I get the fact that it is ingrained in the fabric of our society so it’s no easy feat to change it. It would be a huge undertaking to set things straight which is obviously the reason why it doesn’t change.

However I believe it’s just another example of how logic and reason and common sense are just ignored because people just accept things the way they are.

I use the age old example of Al Capone and the beginning of organised crime was off the back of alcohol prohibition. It certainly still exists but would it have been able to establish itself to the extent it did without prohibition to begin with?

Anyway.Rant over. It’s an argument that I think anyone with even basic common sense agrees with and this topic is raised all the time so I’m just selfishly contributing my 2cents here. I would like to hear if anyone has any thoughts or disagrees etc.

Her name, her smile, her eyes, her everything. The lover boy found something he would never forget, something not even his sedatives could make him stop feel. He found true love, his soulmate sitting right there. 

The lover boy took action, of course. Ha, if only he knew what he was in for…

The girl, unfortunately for him, was not like him. He was sweet, sensitive and reasonable. But a druggie at first. The girl made him back out of a game of pong, so much she could drink. But she also backed out of going for a smoke with him, so red were his eyes already. 

Not even a kiss he got that night, the poor boy. The next day, when the first thing that ran through his head was her smile, he knew she was the one. 

After a long, tortuous and painful path, he learned to sacrifice, but only when she was around. He didn’t understand why, but somehow the boy’s drugs didn’t make him feel so good anymore. The smell of her hair was better then the smell of his weed, the warmth of her hug was better then the warm feeling of his opiates, the sight of her eyes were better then the sights of LSD. 

But she would have none of it. She made the young boy make a choice, but he did not know what to choose. He was only a boy, not a man after all. And so he made his choice, and paid the price for it.

Oh, if only he could go back. Nowadays, not even drugs can wipe the memories away. The boy's choice does not make sense, the feelings for the girl are stronger then anything he can get in his veins...

I had a lot of trouble with my Mum struggling with meth addition about a year and a half ago. She would smoke herself into a meth induced psychosis majority of the time (look through my old posts for reference).

She’s been sober for a while now and I’ve been really proud of her, now that I have my Mum back she’s been really warm and loving. But lately I just have a bad feeling that she might be using again. I don’t have any hard evidence but she fooled me the first time and I had no idea until it got really bad so I don’t want to let her pull the wool over my eyes again if she is doing it. 

For example she has just been really dark lately, like letting us just sit in silence without a conversation and if she is talking she’s bitching about people e.g. family members or work colleagues in a really dark way like they owe her something or have done her wrong and it’s just weird because what she’s talking about doesn’t warrant that kind of reaction, it’s like she’s got a lot of hate, hard to explain. Also she snaps at me and starts yelling very easily over minor things and doesn’t accept any responsibility for acting like a psycho. 

I know it’s no smoking gun but I just have a gut feeling and don’t want it to surprise me again. I’ve done meth a few times but have never been addicted. Could anyone give me some tips for addict behaviour I should look out for.

I heard about phenethylamine through this subreddit and wanted to share some info and experience I've had with it, as there's not a lot of info out there about it and I would like to add to the collective knowledge about this curious, **legal** substance. 

**Some info:**  
Phenethylamine is classed as a legal nootropic but has some recreational potential, as well as reported uses for focus, workouts, and general wellbeing. For those of you that haven't heard of it, phenethylamine is the molecule that many other drugs are built off of, a 'skeleton' of other drugs. It is 1 atom away from being amphetamine, and all the 2-Cx series have phenethylamine as the backbone of the compounds. Phenethylamine or 'PEA' as it is also known is naturally produced in the body and readily metabolised, making the effects very short lived, and quite large quantities of it are needed to feel any effect. If enough is taken it produces an MDMA/cocaine-like intense euphoric 'rush'. Here are 3 of my experiences and dose information.

**Some info about me:**  
I am a 120lb female with an *extremely* low tolerance for drugs. In my experience I need about half a 'normal' dose of any substance to have the same effects as a normal person. eg, I can only tolerate 70mg of MDMA, and half a joint will get me as high as someone smoking a whole one. This being said, when I tried PEA for the first time I started with very low doses as I didn't want to have a bad experience and scare myself off it.

&amp;#x200B;

**First Trial:**  
Dose: 350mg PEA

Full meal beforehand. 20 minutes in, very VERY mild effects. Maybe similar to dextroamphetamine, tiny bit of a rush, needing to pee. Very possible placebo affect affecting results. Lasted 10-15 minutes, felt wave affects as drug wore off. 1hr after swallowing was completely back to baseline.

&amp;#x200B;

**Second Trial**  
Dose: 1050mg

I was bordering on drunk as I took this dose and had been chewing nicotine gum. (Nicotine is a weak MAO-inhibitor, but as PEA is metabolised by MAO, nicotine is said to help it work better and last a little longer) I also gave the same dose to the friends I was drinking with. 30 minutes in felt an INTENSE rush, it was insane! My immediate thought was 'holy FUCK this is legal????' Felt like an MDMA come up. Huge body rush, but clear head. Almost like MDMA without the deliriousness, with the energy and focus of amphetamines. My friends seemed to feel the rush as well, some of them asked for another dose, I was obviously having a much greater effect than them but I expected this due to my low tolerance to drugs. Face went very hot. Started enjoying music a lot more and moving to the beat. No light effects. Was definitely still high an hour in although the initial intense rush was gone. Chewed another piece of nicotine gum which seemed to bring back the effects slightly. Back to completely normal 2h in.

**Third Trial**  
This time I trialed it with my boyfriend who is a tall, 170lb male with a very HIGH tolerance for drugs.  
Dose: 1050mg again, but sober this time.  
Boyfriend's Dose: 2100mg

Had caffeine and nicotine gum before to enhance effects. Once again, exactly 30 minutes in felt the huge euphoric rush. It comes on very quickly, like 0-100 in literally 20 seconds. Back of my head started tingling, body got very hot. Noticed an increase in heartrate. Feels 'floaty', body feels light, it's an extremely fun feeling. The clarity of mind while experiencing these effects is very nice. Had the urge to dance and move to music. My boyfriend, however, despite taking double the amount I had felt almost nothing. He said it was indistinguishable from a placebo. 1hr in noticed a slight increase in heart rate but absolutely no rush and no euphoria. 

1050 seems to be a very comfortable dose for me, I could have taken more but 1050 was definitely enough to have significant effects that are undeniable and not able to be ignored. 1hr after dosing it tapered off in the same way that MDMA does, in 'waves'. Felt fatigued after, almost like the high heart rate and euphoria had worn my body out. Although about 2hrs later I felt completely back to normal, no negative lingering effects and no comedown.

I hope this little writeup can be of use to someone! PEA is a very interesting substance, since it's so closely related to other stimulants, yet also legal. I highly recommend it. Some might say that the very short-lived effects are a downside, but I think it may actually be a positive in certain situations. For eg, if you wanted to have a fun night out but have work early in the morning. I can also see how taking it right before a workout to get you pumped up could be a very useful motivator to get you up and off the couch and into the gym. (I've seen that it's sold sometimes as a pre-workout). The downsides are that you have to take a LOT of it. I'm disappointed that my boyfriend took such a huge dose yet felt nothing, the fun and euphoria it gives you is something you really don't want to miss out on! 

I will likely conduct more tests and trials on myself in the future, and will probably write them up too, as there is so little information out there on this little molecule and differing reports on dosages, effects and mixtures with other substances.

Me and my friend decided to trip at this spot i had never even been so i was ready in all the spot was awesome we tripped hard and long for what had to have been 4 hours before the bad trip picked up and it wasnt really like any trip i had before. basically we were still here in this spot b it it was right next to the highway u couldnt get on the highway but you could hear the cars loud and clear. so what the problem was we were ready to leave but my mind was stuck in this cycle i cant even explain this part but all i could see was the highway but couldnt move at all all i could hear was cars for what felt like HOURSSS but i was told was only minutes apparently i feel asleep or went into some state and it was the scariest thing of my life but when i woke up i still was having a bad trip for some reason i was fine but i felt like everything in the world was against me i kept biting down on my hoodie shirtless while walkin across the freeway. i made it home and things got bad i for some reason dont remember this part but i banged on my stepbrother (dads wife’s son) we didnt get along great before but apparently i broke his door down and scared him bad and he pulled his gun on me which caused my dad to end up hitting him i guess in my defense at the time. this caused him to get up and drive his moms car an hour to philly (he was 15 with no permit) and then yea i came off the bad trip and felt more depressed then a bitch for a whileeeee.",True,False,False,Drugs,t5_2qh7l,691834,public,confidence,self,11 tabs 2nd ever bad acid trip true story.,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hm2wx2/11_tabs_2nd_ever_bad_acid_trip_true_story/,no_ads,0.0,1594048075.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
